A year ago a China research team at IBM went digging here, did a bunch
of changes, and got up to 1000 pCampbots running around at once.
Unfortunately they threw the baby out with the bathwater in what they
optimized away, so it wasn't useful for anything other than their
experiment.

What was learned in that process, as I sifted through results, is we've
got this N^2 bottle neck on avatars that is really our issue.  My
information is a bit out of date, as its been a few months since I've
been in Clientview, so corrections here would be appreciated.

When an avatar moves it's head that information needs to be propogated
around to  everyone else in the environment.  That's N new packets.  But
in any real situation all Avatars are moving around, or looking around,
or in other ways asking the server to send around updates.  And they
need to send as many updates as avatars in the environment.

Part of the problem is the sender is in the Clientview.  So in order to
get that packet back out you need to get it in, distribute it to your 20
client view threads, then signal them all, and they send things back
out.  Because they have to look up a bunch of info, there is a whole
series of locks in those Clientviews that get taken all the time.  And I
mean *all* the time.  At some point we're effectively spending more time
dealing with locks then doing anything else.  People in a Linux
environment running the serverstats plugin will see this as the
Systemtime spike.  At some point System Time ends up consuming more
processor than User Time, which is very bad.  That means lots of context
switches into your kernel.

One solution here would be to get the execution out of clientview, and
have a single network stack for OpenSim.  User clientviews to convert
packets to objects, and objects to packets, but don't let it send them.
 Leave that up to a global packet system.  That would also let you damp
bandwidth at a global level, which today, there isn't really a view off,
because each client view is rather isolated with it's own execution
stack (5 threads or so).  It turns out that in this case our paralism is
actually slowing us down.

That would take a good chunk of work, and it would probably break stuff
for a while, both of which is why I've not gone after it.  It could also
be a wrong approach, given other data on the table.

At any rate, I really think we need to be able to do 40 full avatars
prior to opening things up for lightweight avatars, that will drive more
load (though not N^2 load if we don't give them an appearance or
animations or look at updating).
