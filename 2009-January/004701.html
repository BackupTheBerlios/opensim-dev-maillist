<PRE>well i think your sorta missing the point, say i did reduce my avatar login
footprint by 10, that would only mean that if 10 people simulatanously
logged in, which if your talking about 1000 avatars at once is going to
happen, it means that you will get the same results if 10 avatars hit at
once, so honestly even if we reduce the footprint by 90% we still have the
same problem on logins, the biggest problem i see is mass login, when your
talking about getting 1000 avatars into a region for a single event,
especially if it crashes you could be potentially looking at over 100
avatars trying to log in at the same time, how do we handle this??  if your
talking about 1000 avatars you need to talk about exteme usage case, not
just fractional usage.

</I>&gt;<i> Minor mistake in my last posting, it should have read (8000 variously
</I>&gt;<i> texture prims in the ballpark of about 500+ texures or so).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and since i am recommenting again, i think its important that when we talk
</I>&gt;<i> about 1000 users, we are not talking about 1000 ruths with zero inventory
</I>&gt;<i> and not chatting and doing real world things, pcampbot is a horrible
</I>&gt;<i> representaion of 1000 like i said before every 1000 pcampbots is probably
</I>&gt;<i> not even equal to 20 real world avatars actually doing something with the
</I>&gt;<i> simulator.

</I>&gt;<i> prims and running just over 1000 scripts, when trying to log into the region
</I>&gt;<i> with just 1 avatar that is wearing a 1700 prim avatar that uses every single
</I>&gt;<i> attach point, i am 100% unable to log into the sim ever.  One other thing to
</I>&gt;<i> note is that my avatar has between 11k-12k inventory items and basiclly
</I>&gt;<i> trying to access any simulator with more than about 1000 variously textured
</I>&gt;<i> prims in the ballpark of about 500+ textures or so (even afer running the
</I>&gt;<i> predecode-j2k) i am unable to log in at all.  So again if 1 avatar cant
</I>&gt;<i> access the sim, i personallly dont see 1000 avatars entering a  simulator
</I>&gt;<i> anytime soon if at all ever, atleast like I said in the 1 server world, this
</I>&gt;<i> is probably going to require some major hardware/pipes to achieve.
