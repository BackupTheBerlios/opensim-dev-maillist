<PRE>
I too had this wish for Opensim, but gave up on it understanding it would be too difficult to implement and would hold too many issues. Sure, region *x* arrangements are possible and commonly used, but it does cause more complexity that way and moving all of them together or tweaking each individually could be a bit harder.

My idea back then was being allowed to create regions in powers of 2 (eg: 256x256 as now, then 128x128 smaller or larger 512x512). First thing which wouldn't work here however would be positioning them correctly over certain X and Y coordinates in order to fit smaller sims around larger ones, which would end up causing grid coordinates such as 1000.5, 1001.25. Second, I don't think the client actually supports simulators larger then 256 x 256 so the client would probably need modifying as well to do that. Third, exporting and importing settings and stuff (such as terrain or .oar archives) between different sizes of simulators could be problematic and buggy. And fourth, larger single sims could possibly cause performance issues even with computers in our days.

If some of these issues didn't exist though this might be doable and could be fun. Anyway the best practical way at the moment are region groups of 2x2 or 3x3 or how many you wish for having a larger square, which isn't that bad in the end.

  Like there are the problem of performance when we have more than 15/20 avatares inside one sim , I believe that is important to have regions smaller than 256x256. By example, a &quot;mini-region&quot; having  32x32. Using grid and a server for each of 64 glued mini-regions we can have a superpopulated area of 256x256   running well.
