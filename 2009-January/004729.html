<PRE>That would most likely require modifications to the sl viewer. I think the
Imprudence project is looking at providing a viewer with similar
capabilities: <A HREF="http://imprudenceviewer.org/">http://imprudenceviewer.org/</A>

</I>&gt;<i> type of addition to lsl that would let a scripter actually use a real
</I>&gt;<i> gui as an interface for their scripts instead of hacking one out with
</I>&gt;<i> prims or a dialog box?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this thing came up when I was thinking about what to do for OpenSims 2nd
</I>&gt;<i> birthday.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I thought it would be really funny to reconstruct the Sony Home Arcades
</I>&gt;<i> in OpenSim, basically for giggles. I unfortunately don't have access to Sony
</I>&gt;<i> Home for now so I don't know exactly what effort it means to model this,
</I>&gt;<i> being not a good builder myself (for reference - <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/def8fn">http://tinyurl.com/def8fn</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The interesting point would be the ability to play either MAME or C64
</I>&gt;<i> games on the machines in these 'OpenSim Home (tm) Arcades'. So I looked up a
</I>&gt;<i> C# c64 emulator on the web ( <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/bobw9y">http://tinyurl.com/bobw9y</A> ) but then came to
</I>&gt;<i> think where such an emulator would run.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (the following holds probably true for all kinds of applications running
</I>&gt;<i> in the OpenSim context, namely:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - graphic-heavy c# or c++ applications
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - flash/silverlight/moonlight applications
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - 'co-browsing', works in Rex with this nice trick:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://therexfiles.cybertechnews.org/?p=183">http://therexfiles.cybertechnews.org/?p=183</A> )
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, to stick with the arcade example, the good question is - where does
</I>&gt;<i> the process run?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think there are these possibilities in general
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) SERVER - the application totally runs on the server side. One av takes
</I>&gt;<i> over the game machine and his key strokes are transmitted to the server (via
</I>&gt;<i> HUD?) and the emulator creates the graphic output. This would be a series of
</I>&gt;<i> textures (not really good) or a video stream of sorts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) CLIENT - the applications totally runs on the client. This is possibly
</I>&gt;<i> the easiest way to implement it (and out of scope for opensim-dev) since it
</I>&gt;<i> needs hacking the client. But just for the record: as soon as the client
</I>&gt;<i> detects arcade.jp2 as the texture, it fires up ye old space invaders and
</I>&gt;<i> renders2texture the graphic output to the client.  Other people would see
</I>&gt;<i> either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a) nothing but the standard texture as long as they are not playing it or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; b) a screenshot every 5 secs or so,  since the client sends every 5 secs
</I>&gt;<i> or so a screenshot to the server, updating the view for the cheering
</I>&gt;<i> bystanders
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; c) the real game, since their clients also fire up the emulator, receive
</I>&gt;<i> the key strokes from the current player (while they are near him) which must
</I>&gt;<i> be sent from the server of course.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) BOTH- the application runs on both server and client with
</I>&gt;<i> synchronicity calls every N secs with some prediction by the client side
</I>&gt;<i> when the calls don't get through fast enough (basically like networked
</I>&gt;<i> physics in professional games works)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All in all you are in synchronicity hell the more 'real' the output for
</I>&gt;<i> everyone gets because there can be no real simultaneousness.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So sorted by applications:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Physics:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; either only server sided (like it is now) which is sufficient for most
</I>&gt;<i> use cases, or both when the physics is fast and heavy like in games.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Video:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Number 2c is used to play video in SL right now - one av activates the
</I>&gt;<i> script that start the media playing on all clients in the vicinity. if they
</I>&gt;<i> didn't activate media support then they see nothing. If they did the video
</I>&gt;<i> starts on all clients, probably 1 to N secs off each, depending on their
</I>&gt;<i> network, also slowly drifting into asynchronicity the longer the video runs.
</I>&gt;<i> If it should be more synchronous then a streaming server is mandatory.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Turn based games
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could be implemented completely on server side. So a simple text
</I>&gt;<i> adventure (Zork, anyone) or even a MUD could be implemented even on a
</I>&gt;<i> different server with a gateway of sort. Come to think of it this could even
</I>&gt;<i> be a tty terminal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Same goes for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - co-browsing web pages, powerpoint projectors
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could be either server sided (like it is now via the php render trick) or
</I>&gt;<i> client sided (via the Rex trick)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So the interesting part stays where to implement, say, a moonlight
</I>&gt;<i> application? Let's say people want to create micro/casual games or small
</I>&gt;<i> apps,then it would be interesting to see whether there would be an
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure to hook these things into?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would even go so far that there could be a mechanism that handles LL or
</I>&gt;<i> OS scripts in a way that it either runs on the client (libomv Test.exe with
</I>&gt;<i> some script) or on the server side (the existing scripting architecture).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Dirk/Barth
