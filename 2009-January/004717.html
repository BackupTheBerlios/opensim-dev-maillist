I used to mark mantis bug reports as resolved on exactly this basis, but found that virtually no submitter ever came 
back to them.

So I just switched to closing them instead.  I don't believe this is (or should be) any stigma here if bugs are reopened 
as long as they weren't improperly closed in the first place (e.g. if a reasonable person would conclude that there is a 
fixable bug present but the mantis was closed without any kind of discussion).
