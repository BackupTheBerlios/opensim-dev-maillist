Consider it on my todo list. Of course, I'd also be very happy to see changes/patches from other developers to add the 
necessary switches (with appropriate instructions in the wiki - I don't want to be stuck writing them after someone else 
has done the coding :-)

And as Christopher said in another post, more save-oar options such as the ability to save only objects within a 
specified volume/area sound like good additions for content creators as well.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps the alternative solution in this vein, and one that I had 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> begun to consider, is to produce the equivalent of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OARs but for inventory instead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Inventory is not yet as useful for builds though, as saving a typical 
</I>&gt;<i> modular building ends up as very many separate parts.  My building is 
</I>&gt;<i> over 1500 objects and measures some 50m x 70m.  If I link it all up 
</I>&gt;<i> as one object, I lose the modularity  using save/load-xml and 
</I>&gt;<i> save-load-oar keep it intact which is very useful.
</I>
If we implemented support for taking object groups you wouldn't need to link them, just make sure they're all selected 
when you take.  However, this may well still be inconvenient when there's a large number of objects - I'm not sure.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would separately for other reason support the idea of save-inventor 
</I>&gt;<i> and load-inventory though. We do need to start sharing materials 
</I>&gt;<i> across grids.  I still have no prim hair and my clothes would not cut 
</I>&gt;<i> it in social circles :-)
