</I>&gt;<i> 0.6 version of opensim.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When crossing a region I have detected three requests:

</I>&gt;<i> * Update region into agent data
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These three requests make the avatar to &quot;shiver&quot; when entering a new

</I>&gt;<i> some meters while waiting the response, and then return to the point it

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm able to understand the 1st and the 3rd, well, maybe I have some 
</I>&gt;<i> doubts about the 1st... but the second (request FULL inventory) I think 
</I>&gt;<i> is what &quot;lags&quot; the region entering.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually (version 0.6 remember) when requesting an inventory is the FULL 
</I>&gt;<i> inventory. For testing, maybe no problem, but if I have 100 folders an 
</I>&gt;<i> 1000 items... the initial 6kbyte inventory grows to something like 100k, 
</I>&gt;<i> and the lag make my avie to walk till the middle of the region and then 
</I>&gt;<i> return back...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My question: is really necessary to get the full inventory when crossing 
</I>&gt;<i> regions?
</I>
The code to request the entire agent's inventory information (though not assets, of course) from the inventory service 
has been in place for quite a long time (at least a year).

It does make things simpler from a coding perspective and may actually be better in making inventory more responsive to 
the user (an inventory request only happens once, not on every request from the client, which means latency only needs 
to be suffered once and the inventory server doesn't have to respond to lots of tiny requests.  I shouldn't think that 
the amount of data being delivered, even for an inventory with 1000s of objects, is all that large - certainly no larger 
than a single detailed texture).  That's not to say that this implementation won't change in the future.

In theory, this latency should not cause any problems on region crossing since it is carried out asynchronously.  So any 
region crossing lag you are experiencing should be down to other issues.  I'd be interested to see any detailed evidence 
that this is not the case (probably the most controlled way would be to introduce artificial pauses for inventory 
responses and see what happens - anecdotal evidence is not good enough).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And the secondary question: Is there any implemented or at least a 
</I>&gt;<i> semi-implemented method to deliver only parts of the inventory (&quot;a la SL 
</I>&gt;<i> style&quot;)?
</I>
No
