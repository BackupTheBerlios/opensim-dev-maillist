Betreff: Re: [Opensim-dev] weird idea #2: inworld applications

 

Not sure how to get a c64 emulator to work in opensim, but if it can be
done it should be playing Habitat:

One solution may be to stream a video of the emulator display.

Hi,

this thing came up when I was thinking about what to do for OpenSims 2nd
birthday.

I thought it would be really funny to reconstruct the Sony Home Arcades
in OpenSim, basically for giggles. I unfortunately don't have access to
Sony Home for now so I don't know exactly what effort it means to model
this, being not a good builder myself (for reference -
<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/def8fn">http://tinyurl.com/def8fn</A> )

The interesting point would be the ability to play either MAME or C64
games on the machines in these 'OpenSim Home (tm) Arcades'. So I looked
up a C# c64 emulator on the web ( <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/bobw9y">http://tinyurl.com/bobw9y</A> ) but then
came to think where such an emulator would run.

(the following holds probably true for all kinds of applications running
in the OpenSim context, namely:
- graphic-heavy c# or c++ applications
- flash/silverlight/moonlight applications
- 'co-browsing', works in Rex with this nice trick:
<A HREF="http://therexfiles.cybertechnews.org/?p=183">http://therexfiles.cybertechnews.org/?p=183</A> )

So, to stick with the arcade example, the good question is - where does
the process run?
I think there are these possibilities in general
1) SERVER - the application totally runs on the server side. One av
takes over the game machine and his key strokes are transmitted to the
server (via HUD?) and the emulator creates the graphic output. This
would be a series of textures (not really good) or a video stream of
sorts.
2) CLIENT - the applications totally runs on the client. This is
possibly the easiest way to implement it (and out of scope for
opensim-dev) since it needs hacking the client. But just for the record:
as soon as the client detects arcade.jp2 as the texture, it fires up ye
old space invaders and renders2texture the graphic output to the client.
Other people would see either
a) nothing but the standard texture as long as they are not playing it
or
b) a screenshot every 5 secs or so,  since the client sends every 5 secs
or so a screenshot to the server, updating the view for the cheering
bystanders
c) the real game, since their clients also fire up the emulator, receive
the key strokes from the current player (while they are near him) which
must be sent from the server of course.
3) BOTH- the application runs on both server and client with
synchronicity calls every N secs with some prediction by the client side
when the calls don't get through fast enough (basically like networked
physics in professional games works)

All in all you are in synchronicity hell the more 'real' the output for
everyone gets because there can be no real simultaneousness.

So sorted by applications:
- Physics:
either only server sided (like it is now) which is sufficient for most
use cases, or both when the physics is fast and heavy like in games.
- Video:
Number 2c is used to play video in SL right now - one av activates the
script that start the media playing on all clients in the vicinity. if
they didn't activate media support then they see nothing. If they did
the video starts on all clients, probably 1 to N secs off each,
depending on their network, also slowly drifting into asynchronicity the
longer the video runs. If it should be more synchronous then a streaming
server is mandatory.

- Turn based games
could be implemented completely on server side. So a simple text
adventure (Zork, anyone) or even a MUD could be implemented even on a
different server with a gateway of sort. Come to think of it this could
even be a tty terminal.
  Same goes for
- co-browsing web pages, powerpoint projectors
Could be either server sided (like it is now via the php render trick)
or client sided (via the Rex trick)

So the interesting part stays where to implement, say, a moonlight
application? Let's say people want to create micro/casual games or small
apps,then it would be interesting to see whether there would be an
infrastructure to hook these things into?

I would even go so far that there could be a mechanism that handles LL
or OS scripts in a way that it either runs on the client (libomv
Test.exe with some script) or on the server side (the existing scripting
architecture).

Best regards,
 Dirk/Barth
