<PRE>I think with a bit of trickery its also possible to have multiple region servers managing a 256X256 area. As apart from terrain, a region can tell a client that objects are outside its own 256X256 area. 

So if you had 9 regions set up in a 3X3 array. With the centre 256x256 area being where everything actually would be. Then each of those region servers could manage a 85X85 area (numbers rounded down) of that centre area. 

As I said terrain would be a problem, so the centre server would have to send all the terrain data for that 256X256 area, while the others would maybe send data to show their terrain was under water. 

But for the prims and avatars in each area, each server would just need to be configured to manage a 85X85 area. And then when it is sending data to the client, just offset the data so that the client got the correct positions in that 256X256 centre area.

I also don't think border crossings would require too much extra work, if the region server had been set up to consider its region as 85X85, it would just do a normal transfer to the next region when a avatar moved outside that area. Again some converting of position data would be required in that process but I don't think it would be too much.

So while it would take some work to get opensim to be able to run like this, I don't think it would be a great amount.

multiples of 256. The LL client assumes that as the size, and that is 
hardocded all over the place (regionhandles etc), so if we continue to 
use this client we need to live with that;  but I strongly suspect it is 
possible to trick it, to some extent.

</I>&gt;<i>   Like there are the problem of performance when we have more than 
</I>&gt;<i> 15/20 avatares inside one sim , I believe that is important to have 
</I>&gt;<i> regions smaller than 256x256. By example, a &quot;mini-region&quot; having  
</I>&gt;<i> 32x32. Using grid and a server for each of 64 glued mini-regions we 
</I>&gt;<i> can have a superpopulated area of 256x256   running well.
