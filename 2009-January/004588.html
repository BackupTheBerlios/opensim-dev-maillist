It's perfectly ok cfk, that's not what I meant and such a thing doesn't matter to me at all. Many likely had the same ideas and thoughts on this whoever brought the topic up first. What matters is the decision we take on how to implement such a system the right way :)

&gt;<i> Mircea:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My apologies if your ideas were not credited properly. As I recall, you and others
</I>&gt;<i> have suggested guest logins and I just thought this morning was a good time to
</I>&gt;<i> open the discussion a little bit on our OS2B.
</I>&gt;<i>

Many of us see things the same way Paul. Anon logins would allow Opensim to be used just like the web where you can type an URL and be there. Put in my previous example, like IRC or forums where guests can enter, listen/read and talk/post where they're allowed to but need to register in order to setup avatars, signatures, upload files, have sticky voice / op status... Especially considering that there are some viewers now which can run from web pages, one would just open their web browser, type out the URL and be on OSGrid!

In our case guests would not be able to have persistent inventory, friend lists, profiles, etc. because of technical limits, since anon logins would be temporary like unregistered IRC nicknames so storing anything for them would lead to issues and conflicts as well as keep gigantic storage for nicknames which may never be used again. Being allowed to build or run scripts should be an option of the sim owner in opensim.ini, who could choose if to allow guests to build there or not. Sim owners should also be allowed to specify if guests can enter their sim (in case the grid allows guests too of course) so owners could make their regions off limit to guests if they wish.

Another factor I highlighted in the previous discussion is how guest logins could increase user count on grids and therefore Opensim usage and popularity. Many SL users are still not interested in Opensim a lot, and when they see they have to register to enter places like OSGrid some say &quot;Nah, I don't need to waste my time with another account just to see how an Opensim grid looks like&quot;. Guest logins on popular OS grids would make it much easier for people to enter just to visit or chat, and convince some to join while others who don't care to register could just hang out as guests for as much as they want. OSGrid still suffers from a very low number of users and high number of sims, and guest logins might help improve that and we could see +80 users logged in on a daily basis again.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> People do a lot of web-browsing and perhaps anon accounts will help better
</I>&gt;<i> integrate opensim with the web. Consider the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  1. Someone is browsing the web for a topic such as &quot;red wine&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  2. They get to various wine distributor and vineyard web pages
</I>&gt;<i>  3. They find out that one of the vineyards has a &quot;hot link&quot; to a 3D space
</I>&gt;<i>  4. They click on it and find themselves in the opensim world for the 
</I>&gt;<i> vineyard
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We need to find ways of making it easier, and more transparent, to go 
</I>&gt;<i> between
</I>&gt;<i> #2 and #4. It may be that a stepping-stone is required such as Xenki, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is
</I>&gt;<i> browser embedded (before launching a full-blown viewer).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anon accounts may help because it is similar to unrestricted web browsing.
</I>&gt;<i> And, these accounts may ease the transition between #2 and #4, and thus
</I>&gt;<i> grow the metaverse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -p
