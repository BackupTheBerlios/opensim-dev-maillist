<PRE>Dear Ben:

There are at least three geospatial projects I know of using OpenSim at this time. One is a geographically and historically correct &quot;Prince Edward Island&quot; off Canada from the 19th century.

Another is using lidar images of San Francisco and Berkely. You should be able to google those terms.

A third is encitra.com, which is supported by some on this channel for urban development of mass transit systems in existing cities.

All of these and more are active, although you will find that most of the conversation on this channel is related to OpenSim C# development.

Charles

Hello Ben,

You might be interested to know about the following project on the OpenSimulator Forge called &quot;OpenSIM GIS&quot; [ <A HREF="http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/osgis/">http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/osgis/</A> ] .  I personally do not know much about the project other than what it does and that it is available on our forge. Sorry I can not tell you more about the project, but I do hope the link helps you.

Dear OpenSim community,

I am working on a UK Government Technology Strategy Board funded
feasibility study into &quot;using commercial gaming technology to improve
the user experience in the urban re-generation consultation process&quot;.

My part of the study involves investigating using
Online Virtual Worlds to create an online resource that would help
involve communities in the re-development of urban areas. The idea is
to create virtual worlds which mirror real life cities and enable users
to explore an accurate 3D map of the area under consideration. The user would also be able to create their own spatial
designs from a library of 3D buildings and other geographical
primitives such as trees, plants, walls, fences etc.

I
am interested in including OpenSimulator in my study as a candidate
solution. I notice that early experiments into the importing of geospatial data have taken place at slgis.org. Is the importing of geospatial data something that the OpenSimulator project is actively pursuing or supporting and does anyone on this list have experience of doing so?

If geospatial applications or interest in integration with such technology exists within the project, I would like to ask further questions about OpenSimulator. Would it be OK to pose these questions to this list?

Thanks for your time

Regards

Ben
