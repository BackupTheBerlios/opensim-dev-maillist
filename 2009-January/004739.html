</I>
Maybe this is a slight exaggeration but I'm anticipating that the build time would be much longer.  I'm happy to be 
proved wrong on this point.  Maybe this seems a minor thing but long build times are such a pain in the ass.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> hmm...that kind of goes against the idea of them being modules, i'd think :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Does it?  Isn't this just a convenient way of packaging the core modules that almost everybody is going to need to run 
their OpenSim (though I would admit that some of the modules in there arguably aren't core...)

I feel that what would be really useful is a core mechanism for enabling/disabling modules which doesn't rely on the 
module itself having that option.  This would be simpler and might make the question of whether there are lots of 
modules bundled in a single dll moot (since you can just enable/disable them with separate config entries - and storage 
space for dlls is cheap :-)

Which in itself leads me on to the question of splitting up the massive monolithic config file.  I don't know about 
other people, but I find it a pain to deal with.  I feel that these kinds of changes would be really valuable whilst 
rearranging the module spaces is kind of nice to have but doesn't seem the most pressing issue right now.  But that's 
just my opinion :-)
