It would Justin, that would be great if you could add the feature 
back in.  What parameter is used to drive it.  I made the 
(intentionally least change) idea of just adding -noterrain and -add 
flags on load-oar which would seem to do this?

I appreciate that this could put objects below ground in some 
terrain... but it works for a large number of cases, and below ground 
objects can easily be checked for and retrieved.

</I>
Inventory is not yet as useful for builds though, as saving a typical 
modular building ends up as very many separate parts.  My building is 
over 1500 objects and measures some 50m x 70m.  If I link it all up 
as one object, I lose the modularity  using save/load-xml and 
save-load-oar keep it intact which is very useful.

I would separately for other reason support the idea of save-inventor 
and load-inventory though. We do need to start sharing materials 
across grids.  I still have no prim hair and my clothes would not cut 
it in social circles :-)
