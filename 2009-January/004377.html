Yeah, this is a weakness of inventory archives, though of course there are out of band ways of getting around it (upload 
via a website, etc.)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know others have created LSL scripts to transform XML from a notecard 
</I>&gt;<i> into an in-world object like some of the SL tools available for sale do. 
</I>&gt;<i> So far I know of none that actually use save-xml, xml2, oar output however.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One approach I have been meaning to explore, but have lacked the time 
</I>&gt;<i> and skill, is creating an OpenSim module or special scripted function 
</I>&gt;<i> that would accept XML from xml, xml2 or oar as input, perhaps even 
</I>&gt;<i> directly from a notecard (but that could be a lot of dataserver hits) 
</I>&gt;<i> and automatically build out the represented object in world. In fact, 
</I>&gt;<i> there is already a suggested OSS function to do this from a URL pointing 
</I>&gt;<i> to such XML:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> osRezFromURL(string url, vector pos, vector vel, rotation rot, integer 
</I>&gt;<i> param)
</I>
I think that this is a neat idea Mo!  It's kind of the 3d equivalent of displaying a web page in-world - point your 
script at an url and rez whatever 3d objects it describes instead.  Oh, and probably highly dangerous in any public 
world :) (and hence would be marked as highly hazardous) but might allow some cool stuff in more controlled environments.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A whole family of osRezFrom*() functions would perhaps be best, each 
</I>&gt;<i> with different imposed lag penalties to avoid overloading XML sources. I 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot see such functions, with the parsing and possible network calls, 
</I>&gt;<i> ever being used to rez objects more than once every 0.2 seconds, the 
</I>&gt;<i> usual delay for similar things in LSL. Maybe something like the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> osRezFromXML(string xml, vector pos, vector vel, rotation rot, integer 
</I>&gt;<i> param)
</I>&gt;<i> osRezFromXML2(string xml, vector pos, vector vel, rotation rot, integer 
</I>&gt;<i> param)
</I>&gt;<i> osRezFromOAR(string oar, vector pos, vector vel, rotation rot, integer 
</I>&gt;<i> param)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I admit I like rez from URL best in the long run since it takes care of 
</I>&gt;<i> the ugly issue of getting the XML/XML2/OAR into the string argument in 
</I>&gt;<i> the first place, too many dataserver calls to read such a thing from a 
</I>&gt;<i> notecard I would think. But before layering all the network fetching 
</I>&gt;<i> code having a function that simply does the parsing and rezzing would be 
</I>&gt;<i> work enough to write.

</I>&gt;<i>     This might be a question for Justin as he has worked on the OAR
</I>&gt;<i>     mechanism and load/save-xml console commands....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     It would be useful to be able to take some content, such as  a
</I>&gt;<i>     building or developed area, and to be able top save that in a  form
</I>&gt;<i>     that can be downloaded or shared with others to get the same content
</I>&gt;<i>     in heir own opensim setup.  save-xml, save-xml2 preserve the whole of
</I>&gt;<i>     a sim region keeping creatorid, ownerid, lastownerid and prim uuids
</I>&gt;<i>     as they were, and save-oar pr serve the whole of the contents of a
</I>&gt;<i>     sim region including the terrain height map.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The mechanism I have used to make a building available to different
</I>&gt;<i>     Opensim setups, or in different areas of our own build is to use one
</I>&gt;<i>     of two mechanisms...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     a) save-xml on a sim region that ONLY contains the required content
</I>&gt;<i>     (I use a sandbox region just for this purpose), and note how many
</I>&gt;<i>     prims were in the region as a check.. I edit the creatorid, ownerid
</I>&gt;<i>     and lastownerid manually (i.e. change UUID for 3 X number of prims).
</I>&gt;<i>     Then on restore I use the load-xml with -newuid flag to ensure new
</I>&gt;<i>     UUIDs are used for the newly loaded prims.  I then check the required
</I>&gt;<i>     number fo saved prims did come back in.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     b) save-oar on a sim region that ONLY contains the required content
</I>&gt;<i>     (I use a sandbox region just for this purpose).  load-oar into an
</I>&gt;<i>     empty sandbox region (as the terrain will change).  Then take the
</I>&gt;<i>     contents into inventory - with the disadvantage that relative
</I>&gt;<i>     positioning of parts is lost.  or link teh whole build and take into
</I>&gt;<i>     inventory to be moved where you wish with the disadvantage that major
</I>&gt;<i>     linked parts in a modular build are lost.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     As you can see, the save-xml and save-oar are VERY clise to what is
</I>&gt;<i>     needed, but are really for archiving within one Opensim set rather
</I>&gt;<i>     than transfer of modular assets to others.  I think a mechanism to
</I>&gt;<i>     save-oar with a  flag to say -noterrain, and/or a mechanism to
</I>&gt;<i>     load-oar -noterrain that can ignore any terrain included in the
</I>&gt;<i>     OAR  and a way to say -add so that the objects in te oar are added to
</I>&gt;<i>     the current region, rather than everything being replaced would be
</I>&gt;<i>     close to what is wanted.  A way to make sure that all UUIDs in the
</I>&gt;<i>     new content are suitable for the target environment (Prim UUID,
</I>&gt;<i>     texture UUIDs, creatorid, ownerid and lastownerdid) may be needed if
</I>&gt;<i>     the OAR mechanism does not already do that.
