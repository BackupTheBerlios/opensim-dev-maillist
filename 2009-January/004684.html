<PRE>I thought that the biggest contributors to agent related overhead were the
object updates and asset downloads that had to be sent to each viewer - not
sure that a &quot;simple observer&quot; would reduce that overhead all that much.
Perhaps if these data transfers could somehow be offloaded from the host
that was managing the scene, some sort of &quot;sharding&quot; but only scene content
and updates, and let the clients still send their individual updates to the
main host? This may accomplish something similar to what you are describing.

&gt;<i> One problem with SL that is addressed quite often is the limited number
</I>&gt;<i> of AVs that one region can hold ('the number of people on an island').
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This comes up in the 'big number' discussion and especially in nearly
</I>&gt;<i> every meeting scenario that is of high interest to the community.
</I>&gt;<i> Somehow this is also influencing the 'relevance of SL' (and thus
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim)technology and grid technology in general ('I can have hundreds
</I>&gt;<i> of people in a Habbo place but only around 50 in SL')
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really want to dodge the official 'big numbers' discussion by stating
</I>&gt;<i> what would happen when there would be hundreds of people in one IRC
</I>&gt;<i> channel and all of them were writing at the same time. But I do believe
</I>&gt;<i> that one viable 'big number' scenario is a podium discussion where a
</I>&gt;<i> couple of persons are discussing and most of the other people are
</I>&gt;<i> listening/watching/reading in general. Or a sports event of sorts, with
</I>&gt;<i> - well :-) - 22 people acting and many more watching.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what I think what would be valuable is a 'lightweight agent'
</I>&gt;<i> construction. This would be an AV that basically can't do much except
</I>&gt;<i> listening/watching/reading, she especially couldn't rezz anything. It's
</I>&gt;<i> a bit like the 'spectator mode' in some games. This way there could be
</I>&gt;<i> big numbers of watchers, thus giving more people the opportunity to
</I>&gt;<i> attend a meeting - practically increasing the number of virtual beings
</I>&gt;<i> in a region, without bringing the region down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could think of at least two ways to acchieve this:
</I>&gt;<i> - a camera woman AV that 'lightweight agents' could hook up to, using
</I>&gt;<i> the client only as a viewer; this would be a bit like a video stream,
</I>&gt;<i> just with less impact, since the rendering is still done in the viewer.
</I>&gt;<i> - a stripped down agent that got rid of everything that causes too much
</I>&gt;<i> stress on either network or server. Unfortunately I don't know how to do
</I>&gt;<i> that because I don't know the OpenSim construction enough. These
</I>&gt;<i> lightweight agents could have a representation (a sphere?) while they
</I>&gt;<i> are online, a distinct place and the ability to look around and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> move slowly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By having something like that we could get rid of the 'theres just a
</I>&gt;<i> small number of AVs in every region' dilemma.
