<PRE>Dear Bri:

Can you offer some suggestions as to what you might propose as we move forward? If I get your drift, you are addressing what many call &quot;regression&quot;, and that is important also. One of the thoughts I had on that subject was a series of sims with scripts running 24/7 demonstrating the various functions that folks could log in and see they were working after each update. At least that is what we have been doing on the plazas for some time. 

Perhaps you have some additional insight that could let us close the loop?

Charles

p.s. I know a sailboat is not a vehicle and making sure the force, mass, torque functions keep working is also important.

On completed functions, what appears to be constantly ignored are other area 
changes or errors that will break what was a working function. This consumes a 
great deal of time thinking of new methods for an equivalent and to me defeats 
the purpose of a function. The number of functions in that category is not 
trivial. A few of us have considered creating a script to test all as a 
harbinger.

Absolutely agreed on the compatibility. There will be implementation  quirks worth matching, but I think in most cases code can be made to work on  both OS and SL easily enough, and will be more reliable for the thought put  into it.

If anyone has BSD licensed (because I'm not getting into reading code  that might cause trouble later) code which uses entirely implemented  functions, but doesn't work in only one of OS/SL, feel free to e-mail it to me  with instructions and I'll fix it, give a good reason why it can't/shouldn't  be fixed, or take that back...

The vehicle functions are stubs and could use a  little attention. That is, llSetVehicleType, llSetVehicledoubleParam,  llSetVehicleFloatParam, llSetVehicleVectorParam, llSetVehicleRotationParam,  llSetVehicleFlags &amp; llRemoveVehicleFlags.

I dont think it is that  crucial to have complete secondlife compatibility at this point. I rather  think it is more important to get enough functionality so that folks can use  scripts at all.

We can have all those wonderful discussions about  compatibility as soon as we have all the functions implemented. And I expect  that discussion and the resulting patches to go on for some  time.

Big  congratulations to everyone who has contributed, I had no idea it was this  close. Do we have a list of functions which only have a partial  implementation and need more work?
 
Regards,
 
Adam

There are 27 LSL functions with no  implementation left, and they are:

llRotTarget, llRotTargetRemove,  llLoopSoundMaster, llLoopSoundSlave, llPlaySoundSlave, llLookAt,  llStopLookAt, llCollisionFilter, llAttachToAvatar, llDetachFromAvatar,  llRotLookAt, llPointAt, llStopPointAt, llGodLikeRezObject, llPassTouches,  llSetDamage, llTextBox, llPassCollisions, llGetCenterOfMass, llEdgeOfWorld,  llSetSoundQueueing, llTriggerSoundLimited, llGroundRepel,  llRemoteDataSetRegion &amp; llSetInventoryPermMask.

We started with  Tedd's vision a bit over a year ago and 300 functions are implemented, that  is a great job to all who contributed. 

The end is in sight, and  patches to partially or completely implement one or more of these functions  would be greatly appreciated by  all.
