<PRE>I have been making a fresh start on our Opensim base &quot;Open 
Vue&quot;  setup to return to Grid Mode, MySQL and bring over some of the 
assets we had created over the last year or so of running 
Opensim.  It has meant I have tested some areas that normally none of 
us see with a previously partly built environment... and made me look 
at te Wiki, documentation, use infrequent console commands, etc.  I 
thought I would not a few things that arose here in case its helpful 
to the developers responsible for the various areas:

a) &quot;create user&quot; console command is an odd one out, as all others 
have hyphens in the names.  I always get that wrong if I have not 
used it for a while.  Can we at least add &quot;create-user&quot;extra even if 
&quot;create user&quot; stays? [perhaps reset user password&quot; similarly is 
another without Hyphens?]

b) save-xml/load-xml is noted as deprecated. But its got -newuid and 
relocation facilities, which means I have used it to archive 
individual buildings (by saving a clean &quot;build&quot; region for each.  I 
don't think it should be removed until save-xml23/load-xml2 is 
changed to add back those important features.

c) I always have to manually edit saved xml and xml2 files to change 
the creatorid, ownerid and lastownerid to a new UUID of an avatar 
that exists in the new setup environment.  It would be better if 
-newuid did that automatically, seeing it to the owner of te target 
region perhaps?  Or allow another parameter to force this.

d) The maps do not seem to refresh, there ought to be a way to have 
these refreshed at some defaulted) set rate - an opensim.ini parameter maybe.

e) For the Hypergrid, once a link-region X Y has been done, is there 
a command to remove that link to clear it from X Y?  The Console 
Commands Wiki page could usefully have a Hypergrid secrtion with the 
added commands when you run Opensim.exe in -hypergrid mode.  I have 
started an entry there with the link-region command specified.
