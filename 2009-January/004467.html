Dear Bri:

I was certainly not criticizing you. I was just trying to figure out how to best move forward. We are all volunteers and the trick is always to figure out how to leverage all of our efforts to help each other move forward. One of the ideas I had was to have a set of scripts running on a set of known regions that folks could go and see were working and obtain the source from a web site. Another related part of that same idea was to update regions and have a set of scripts that one can easily check on with a login after region update.

That is one of the purposes of the fountain, html-on-a-prim and a couple of the other demonstrations at Wright Plaza.

So, perhaps some similar idea might help you and your group.

Charles

As to the SL compatibility, at this point in 
development running back to SL to test is a handy tool. That also is a reason to 
get flow control statements completed.
Our next meeting we will see what we 
can concoct as a suggestion besides whining.

Dear Bri:

Can you offer some suggestions as to what you might  propose as we move forward? If I get your drift, you are addressing what many  call &quot;regression&quot;, and that is important also. One of the thoughts I had on  that subject was a series of sims with scripts running 24/7 demonstrating the  various functions that folks could log in and see they were working after each  update. At least that is what we have been doing on the plazas for some time. 

Perhaps you have some additional insight that could let us close the  loop?

Charles

p.s. I know a sailboat is not a vehicle and making  sure the force, mass, torque functions keep working is also  important.

On completed functions, what appears to be constantly ignored are other  area changes or errors that will break what was a working function. This  consumes a great deal of time thinking of new methods for an equivalent and to  me defeats the purpose of a function. The number of functions in that category  is not trivial. A few of us have considered creating a script to test all as a  harbinger.

Absolutely agreed on the compatibility. There will be implementation  quirks worth matching, but I think in most cases code can be made to work on  both OS and SL easily enough, and will be more reliable for the thought put  into it.

If anyone has BSD licensed (because I'm not getting into reading code  that might cause trouble later) code which uses entirely implemented  functions, but doesn't work in only one of OS/SL, feel free to e-mail it to  me with instructions and I'll fix it, give a good reason why it  can't/shouldn't be fixed, or take that back...

The vehicle functions are stubs and could use a  little attention. That is, llSetVehicleType, llSetVehicledoubleParam,  llSetVehicleFloatParam, llSetVehicleVectorParam,  llSetVehicleRotationParam, llSetVehicleFlags &amp;  llRemoveVehicleFlags.

I dont think it is that crucial to have  complete secondlife compatibility at this point. I rather think it is more  important to get enough functionality so that folks can use scripts at  all.

We can have all those wonderful discussions about  compatibility as soon as we have all the functions implemented. And I  expect that discussion and the resulting patches to go on for some  time.

Big  congratulations to everyone who has contributed, I had no idea it was this  close. Do we have a list of functions which only have a partial  implementation and need more work?
 
Regards,

There are 27 LSL functions with no  implementation left, and they are:

llRotTarget, llRotTargetRemove,  llLoopSoundMaster, llLoopSoundSlave, llPlaySoundSlave, llLookAt,  llStopLookAt, llCollisionFilter, llAttachToAvatar, llDetachFromAvatar,  llRotLookAt, llPointAt, llStopPointAt, llGodLikeRezObject, llPassTouches,  llSetDamage, llTextBox, llPassCollisions, llGetCenterOfMass,  llEdgeOfWorld, llSetSoundQueueing, llTriggerSoundLimited, llGroundRepel,  llRemoteDataSetRegion &amp; llSetInventoryPermMask.

We started with  Tedd's vision a bit over a year ago and 300 functions are implemented,  that is a great job to all who contributed. 

The end is in sight, and  patches to partially or completely implement one or more of these  functions would be greatly appreciated by  all.
