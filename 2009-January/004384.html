I would find this quite useful. Also combined with being able to do even very simple filtering
with save-oar - eg only save things within the bounds of &lt;x1,y1,z1&gt; and &lt;x2,y2,z2&gt;
would make managing content much easier than manually pulling apart oar files
and putting them back together again. 

Regards,

Chris
