But that's really saying 2 things.  It should be a seperate dll, and it
should be in a seperate source tree.  I'm personally not a fan of doing
both of those things at once, because they are seperate things, and it's
easy to forget that.

&gt;&gt;<i> It would mean that we would easily be able to replace implementations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for various core modules without needing to touch the rest.  For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instance, when diva started to tackle the world map issue, she not only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had to build her own world map, but to change the one in the core to not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> load.  Had we been under this model, she wouldn't have needed to do that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would still mean that people would have to move the dll being included in core so that it was no longer loaded by 
</I>&gt;<i> the system.  To me, this seems no less of a task than having a configurable list of modules that are loaded.  Having to 
</I>&gt;<i> move dlls also means that it isn't easy to pass configuration files around - instead you have to give instructions or 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts for moving around modules in the filesystem.
</I>
This comes back to the addins question.  Having seen this work pretty
well with gnome-do, I think that gets addressed seperately, including
the ability to notify you of new upstream modules and download them.

&gt;&gt;<i> Don't fear the projects, more projects don't hurt you. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But in this case they do, in terms of cluttering up the solution with lots and lots of projects that are all used anyway 
</I>&gt;<i> in almost all OpenSim installations and possible in terms of increasing build times (I admit that I may be paranoid on 
</I>&gt;<i> this point and there might be ways to fix this via nant changes).  It will also increase the effort required for 
</I>&gt;<i> refactoring existing code into modules, since creating a new project takes more time.
</I>
So we should put all the database drivers into a single dll?  As a Linux
user I'm pained far more by filesystem cluster and mismatch of classname
to .cs file, or dll to directory.

We've already decided that seperation and organization is needed, look
at all the structure in the OpenSim/Region/Environment/Modules directory
tree.

That being said, this isn't an all or nothing approach.  I'd say step
one, lets get the modules into a seperate dll (like diva suggested).
Then we can experiment with some level break up and see if it does cause
the end of the world. :)  If so, we can quickly go back.

Honestly, it should reduce build times.  As a change in 1 module isn't
going to require rebuild on everything.
