<PRE>Minor mistake in my last posting, it should have read (8000 variously
texture prims in the ballpark of about 500+ texures or so).

and since i am recommenting again, i think its important that when we talk
about 1000 users, we are not talking about 1000 ruths with zero inventory
and not chatting and doing real world things, pcampbot is a horrible
representaion of 1000 like i said before every 1000 pcampbots is probably
not even equal to 20 real world avatars actually doing something with the
simulator.

</I>&gt;<i> prims and running just over 1000 scripts, when trying to log into the region
</I>&gt;<i> with just 1 avatar that is wearing a 1700 prim avatar that uses every single

</I>&gt;<i> note is that my avatar has between 11k-12k inventory items and basiclly
</I>&gt;<i> trying to access any simulator with more than about 1000 variously textured
</I>&gt;<i> prims in the ballpark of about 500+ textures or so (even afer running the
</I>&gt;<i> predecode-j2k) i am unable to log in at all.  So again if 1 avatar cant
</I>&gt;<i> access the sim, i personallly dont see 1000 avatars entering a  simulator
</I>&gt;<i> anytime soon if at all ever, atleast like I said in the 1 server world, this
</I>&gt;<i> is probably going to require some major hardware/pipes to achieve.
