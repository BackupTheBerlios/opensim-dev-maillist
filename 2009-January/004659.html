Teravus,
 
you're revisiting our old, old, vision of having a many-to-many between scenes and regions, I think. (Where regions would be the IP endpoints, and the scene the graph)
 
If I understand you correctly, we would separate region from scene, letting the regions manage their bit of terrain, but having one region have a 'scene' that was 768x768, centered on the mid 'region'.
 
(Btw, can you terraform in a neighbour region? If not, a hacked setup might be a bit cumbersome to administrate)
 
So, the physics engine would communicate with the scene, but something would have to 'route' scene updates to the right scenepresence (avatar to the root, terrain to the right child). 
 
And if it does, as all presences are 'root' presences today (as per an earlier post by Diva) I think that that would mean we are on our way towards a _true_ (as in 'not a one-off hack') many-to-many scene/region relationship.
Which I believe could seriously rock, eventually.
And yes, in the 'hack' version, you would have to disable the moving the avatar and objects between regions bit.

However, also, so far, the only two things that I've found&gt; that really make use of that limitation is terrain, and maptiles.&gt; The terrain system is designed in such a way that it makes a region&gt; have 256x256m split into 16x16 blocks and therefore there's only space&gt; for that. Map Blocks just assume 256x256. Mind you, the client&gt; also seems to use it for caching the terrain and objects as well, so&gt; it really shouldn't change whatever it is or the client will have an&gt; issue&gt; &gt; Now, the kicker is object positions, avatar positions, textures,&gt; border crossings and just about everything else *doesn't care about&gt; 256x256 on the client side*. The rest of the 256x256 limitations&gt; are in the service.&gt; &gt; So, solutions..&gt; &gt; Now, technically, it's possible to make a region 512x512 and have it&gt; generate 4 maptiles and 3 'psudo regions' in the client stack.. the&gt; psudo regions would simply be 'terrain senders' and 'terrain update'&gt; mechanisms.. and that would work!&gt; &gt; Any thoughts on this?&gt; &gt; Best Regards&gt; &gt; Teravus&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
