<PRE>
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - Asterisk is a PITA to work with&gt; &gt;&gt; - One would need to learn SIP telephony networking details to do a&gt; &gt;&gt; proper and secure job of making a VoIP network&gt; &gt;&gt; - using the hopefully simpler an better supported XMPP protocol suite&gt; &gt;&gt; for IM, voice, and video&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I really think this will only be interesting if SIP is still supported.
</I>Yay for SIP - we've implemented spatial (server-side mixed) voice for OpenSim using an unaltered SL client communicating with an voice client using an embedded SIP Client based on pjsip[1]
 
For us, Freeswitch[2] turned out to be the best alternative on the server side. We have also implemented a full conference system with a custom freeswitch module, allowing us to do very nifty stuff with creating sub-groups and moving people between them.
 
As this is a full voice and moderated conferencing implementation, we are offering it as a commercial license - but of course, if anybody would initiate an open source initiative based on the same set of technologies, we would be more than willing to contribute our experience.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; As Voice in Virtual worlds gets really interesting if you can also&gt; &gt; transparently bring in other sources of voice (call in numbers, or&gt; &gt; individuals). It's not just asterix that supports SIP, it's every major&gt; &gt; new commercial phone switch on the market.
</I> 
As I said, yay for SIP - I also think we should think a bit about using SIP in other areas of OpenSim, as for example as the.. uhh.. protocol to initiate sessions.
&gt;<i> SIP was used in rexcom prototyping in December. Worked, even.&gt; &gt; The Telepathy lib(s), which are now considered for IM and voice etc, &gt; support both XMPP and SIP (and IRC and Skype and whatnot).
</I>We will follow your development with great interest!
