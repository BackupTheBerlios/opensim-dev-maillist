<PRE>actually should we wait a while and get more reaction. As this is going to effect anyone who has a module that isn't in trunk. Seems a lot of hasle for such a small thing.

Would seem better to wait and make the change when/if we change to homer's new module interface.

We really did have it in the code standards at one time that we used UK spelling.

What if we just shorten it to Init?  It has the advantages of being
short, and not running into spelling nuances.  If people like such a
plan, I'll convert the code next week to it.
