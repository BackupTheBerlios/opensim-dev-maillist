But it is in our code standards somewhere that we use UK spelling in opensim code. ;)   Or it used to be in there.

But no I don't think really we can force people to use a different system of spelling to what they are used to. As I feel as strong about not liking the US spelling as you do about UK ones.

But I would be extremely sad if all the current code was swapped to US spelling. This was started as a UK project as it was just myself working on it at the start.

But its now a international project, let lets try and get as many spelling systems as possible in there, lets even try for different languages ;)

I'm not really a fan of UK zpelling,,, but I imagine people uzing grep could zearch for &quot;initiali&quot;

I'll probably continue to uze the UZ englizh zpelling in my code ;)

I have to say I'm not a big fan of what I've seen of mono.addins so far. Maybe ExtensionLoader is better, so I do think we should look at that. As I think it is better to only have one system of loading plugins/modules.

As for initialise vs Initialize, hehe. Well personally I think it should stay as it is. I really see no reason to change it. I do know of other opensource projects that use initialise, Ogre being one. And it would be as hard for me to remember to look/search for Initialize as it would be for you to look for initialise.

So my vote is a strong keep to UK english or even the mix we have (because some bits are in US english). But I really don't think people should have to switch code that is there to US english. Sorry thats a point I do feel quite strongly on.

But saying that if everyone else voted in favour of that switch I wouldn't stand in the way. Just would think it was wrong. Any code I write is just likely to have uk spelling. The same way any code you write is likely to have US spelling. And opensim has had the UK spelling from the start.

I have two requests:

1. Can we unify RegionModules with IPlugin system I did a while ago?
This would mean learning and using Mono.Addins, or ExtensionLoader if
that is Mono.Addins's replacement.

Let's just use one system. I am not sure there is a semantic reason
why they should be different.

I didn't touch it myself because I didn't/don't understand the
delicate internals of RegionModules, and was worried about precisely
the sort of issues raised by Homer.

Also, Dispose() can be used in using{} statements. Lets use it, or
have a base class default to Dispose(){ Close(); }.

2. Can we standardize on US English?

I know our illustrious founder MW speaks the Queen's English, which is
the language of the educated; its not really fair to enforce the
linguistic hegemony of the country that spawned GWB and Britany Spears
in our dear pool of sanity and righteousness; but every open source
project I've ever worked on spells it Initialize. Including
Mono.Addins.

You have no idea how times I had to grep my source for &quot;Initialize&quot; in
order to make it compile. :(

Cheers,
