<PRE>Great. These are interesting ideas. Having a dynamic last name assigned like &quot;Guest001&quot; through &quot;Guest999&quot; (or Anon, or Anonymous) might be a way forward for chat and IM. Personally, I would prefer a 'shorter' as opposed to 'longish' last name, but thats only my personal typing bias.

I could certainly see OpenViewer, Hippo, IdealistViewer or RexClient moving in this direction if there was sufficient community interest.

The main reason I brought it up was to think forward a little bit towards educational, scientific and general usage in a 3D internet paradigm that might be one of those small steps that would gain OpenSim more acceptance.

I am not thinking of the SecondLife client or maingrid here so much as trying to imagine a few features that would benefit OpenSim six months from now. And a guest or anon login seems like one of those.

This being the eave of our OS2B, it just seemed to me that discussing a few of these sorts of ideas would be at least stimulating for our OpenSim community.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] anon logins

Last name &quot;anonymous&quot;; first name would have to be unique. Then you
would have a unique first/last name to make the viewer happy. Perhaps a
web page could assign you a unique first name before you logged in.

Opensim would then need to treat this user special, (anyone with last
name anonymous). I would imagine the Opensim.ini file would specify
what capabilities an anonymous user had.

[anonymous]
move=true
fly=false
chat=true
shout=false
build=true
script=false
etc.

Peace,
Sean

Frank give this a try , try logging into osgrid or
secondlife 2 times with the same account and tell me what happens, and
how do you think the SL viewer would respond if 30 peopel logged into
Wright Plaza with the name &quot;Anonymous User&quot; think beyond just the
login, think about functionaly using Chat and access things in world
that require checking the user name and delivering information to
them..  Personally i dont see this happening with the Linden Viewer,
but lets keep the topic rolling here, im not trying to shut it down,
perhaps someone can prove me wrong.
