It will only work if the user is logged in to that region - inventory will not be requested for users that are not present.

However, even without this code, it's not too difficult for anybody with direct access to the inventory service (such as 
region operators) to get your inventory.  This was the kind of problem that the secure inventory facility aimed to 
address but which we ended up having problems with for one reason or another.  I don't know if there were other problems 
with that, but even that wouldn't address the issue if someone wandered in to a sim operated by a malicious or simply 
curious person.
