&gt;<i> &gt; In fact, &gt; &gt; there is already a suggested OSS function to do this from a URL pointing &gt; &gt; to such XML:&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; osRezFromURL(string url, vector pos, vector vel, rotation rot, integer &gt; &gt; param)&gt; &gt; I think that this is a neat idea Mo! It's kind of the 3d equivalent of displaying a web page in-world - point your &gt; script at an url and rez whatever 3d objects it describes instead. Oh, and probably highly dangerous in any public &gt; world :) (and hence would be marked as highly hazardous) but might allow some cool stuff in more controlled environments.
</I>In Tribal One, ViewPorts (the xml content render containers) could be 'rezzed' from inventory; ie, if an inventory item had a description that contained an url, what would happen was that dragging it into the world would create not an object, but a viewport container, that would asynchrounusly load the xml contents of the url - with a post, containing the userId of the originator; so a service could respond to a general request like <A HREF="http://3dcars.com/cars/mycar.php?key=s3cr3t&amp;model=pontiac">http://3dcars.com/cars/mycar.php?key=s3cr3t&amp;model=pontiac</A>&quot; and supply the xml definition for that users previously configured 3D car, not by looking it up and dumping it, but by generating it in code, just as almost any web page is generated today.
 
Unfortunately, this working prototype of ours has been taken offline and has long since 'rotted' (being based on circa r3000...) but the concept still has merit. It allows web coders to use some kind of standard library (that's why I've been proposing a simple and reference-free standard SceneGraph definitions and manipulations library shipped with and used by the OpenSim core) to build objects programatically, in php or whatever web language you want, and then expose it so that a region can show the output as 3D.
 
So, an army of web coders could code stuff that a distinctly lesser army of OpenSim coders would not have to.
 
Also, it poses some interesting angles with regards to distributed and combined inventory and 'home regions' where you pull data from several sources onto your space, instead of going to them for it.
