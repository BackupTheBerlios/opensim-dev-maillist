</I>&gt;<i> To be really useful, we need to add support for taking 'groups' of objects in OpenSim.  In other words, you don't make a 
</I>&gt;<i> linkset but you just select a group of objects at once and take it.  On the Linden Grid, this takes the whole group into 
</I>&gt;<i> your inventory as a single entry (with a different icon), allowing you to rerez it later.  Currently on OpenSim, doing 
</I>&gt;<i> this will just take each object singly.  Unfortunately, supporting a group of objects will require a fair bit of work.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>What might even be more useful is to go beyond the Linden approach and allow
scene graph hierarchy with a linkset of linksets of linksets ....etc. 
Then, one doesn't
need the selecting of a group of objects since one would partition the 
scene logically
into hierarchical groups. Would this be difficult in the current code?

-p
&gt;<i> If this support was in place, then you could take the whole group in a developed area and save it as a single inventory 
</I>&gt;<i> item.  This could then be archived and said archive made available to others to import back into their inventory. 
</I>&gt;<i> However, this still may not work because it might be rather awkward to select all the objects in a big build to take as 
</I>&gt;<i> a single group.  What do you think?
