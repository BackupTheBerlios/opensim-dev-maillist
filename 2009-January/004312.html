I can't remember seeing one off the top of my head - I'm not sure exactly how functional those sections of code are 
right now.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> - so much so that I've had to limit that one server down to three sims 
</I>&gt;<i> meanwhile another of the same configuration is able to handle eight. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While poking around I came up with the idea of an OS function that could

</I>&gt;<i> however I cant seem to figure out how exactly to get that to work.  So

</I>&gt;<i> alternative I wonder if an NPC / bot based method could also work 
</I>&gt;<i> wherein an NPC module could be setup to respond to certain chat commands 
</I>&gt;<i> and then give items or folders from its own inventory. 
</I>
Perhaps you could give it a bit more detail about this.  What problem are you looking to solve that can't be handled by 
prim inventory or the built in library?  I don't yet understand why you need to take this approach.
