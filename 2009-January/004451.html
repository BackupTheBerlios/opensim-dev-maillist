<PRE>well I wasn't planning/hoping to be the one who hosted this list myself. 

I was hoping that someone in the community would make a simple website and host it. 

I guess if no one else takes it up, then I'll have to see.

I think this is a great idea, but the questions that come to    mind, are: how is the mapping handled for these sub lists and how does a user    say that they don't want these sub lists on their map. I think the number of    options required could be quite high and think its something that needs some    thought before any attempt to add these functions is made.

That way a larger grid      could configure itself and individual regions could join in without      requiring an update to a central web site.

     I've        just added some very initial support for reading Hypergrid link data from        xml files, that includes support for the xml files being on a        webserver.

The xml file has a format like:


&lt;Nini&gt;

 &lt;Section Name=&quot;Region1&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;Key Name=&quot;xloc&quot; Value=&quot;1002&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;Key Name=&quot;yloc&quot; Value=&quot;1006&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;Key Name=&quot;externalPort&quot; Value=&quot;9006&quot; /&gt;

   &lt;Key Name=&quot;externalHostName&quot; Value=&quot;osl2.nac.uci.edu&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;Key Name=&quot;localName&quot; Value=&quot;OSGrid-Gateway&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/Section&gt;
 &lt;Section Name=&quot;Region2&quot;&gt; 
   ...
 &lt;/Section&gt;

 ...
&lt;/Nini&gt;

And to make a region load it and create the        links, you use the console command:  link-region &lt;URI&gt;        [&lt;excludeList&gt;]

The excludeList parameter is so that certain        links in those xml files are ignored.

With the format:        excludeList&lt;xml SectionName&gt;[;&lt;xml SectionName&gt;]. 

The        main thinking for this is so that a single list for a certain group/event        could be created. Then everyone interested in it, just adds their own        region data to the list. 

But so they can also point their own        region at that list, they just add the section name they used to the        exclude list, so that it doesn't try to link to itself.

If we can        find a way of having a xml file on a webserver that people can add new        entries to (maybe through a form script). Then I think it would be a good        idea to have such a list for OpenSim's 2nd birthday.

Although this        idea really needs some sort of automapping or at least better        configuration of the map locations that the regions are placed at.        

I think if everyone just agrees that a certain area on the map [so        say x,y - x+25, y+25] is reserved for link regions, that it is workable        for now.
