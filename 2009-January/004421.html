<PRE>As you can see from my recent inputs we have been having a clear out 
of out Opensim after running an early Grid 18 months ago, then a 
standalone with 12 regions for 2008 and now with a (fresh start) 
UGAIM grid setup, 12 regions on same server, add in regions on other 
servers, and even trying hypergrid.  So I hope the feedback using a 
range of Opensim features and mechanism is useful for the OS dev team.

The load-save-oar mechanism does seem to offer a lot of what is 
needed to archive and set up previous environments, or start from 
scratch occasionally and in new grids, especially if the few extra 
options that Justing spoke about and we discussed last week are added.

One thing I have come across though is maintaining UUIDs of some key 
elements that are very heavily built into assets that are 
saved...  region, UUIDs, avatar UUIDs.   and maybe estate UUIDs

1) Region is seem to be handled simply.  If you FIRST introduce a 
region via an XML file with a given UUID, it takes that on.  So UUIDs 
can be preserved in the new environment (or indeed on test setups on 
salty builds ahead fo a real deployment as I do).  You cannot ALTER 
the UUID of a region via changes to the region XML file though... and 
that needs to be made explicit.

2) Avatar ids are MUCH more problematic.  I know of no way to force a 
newly created user in a new environment to tale on the UUI I want... 
and I have felt it unsafe to risk simply altering the MySQL data base 
UUId for avatars once created.  I wonder if the &quot;create user&quot; console 
command could have an extra parameter always asked for for an UUID 
(with the default benign that a new one is generated?  Would that 
work and be simple to do?  It coukd go straight after name and 
password prompts?

      Specify UUID [new UUID]:

3) Esatate UUIDs I am not sure about.  I have not worried about them 
to date.  But they may become more important.
