But I can see a case for moving all the modules that are currently in OpenSim.Region.Environment, into a single separate project/dll called something like OpenSim.Region.CoreModules.

Ah, but the problem is then those all need to release at the same time.
 One of the reasons to get us into seperate dlls per module is so that
the IRC module could be updated and distributed without pushing out the
rest of the dll.

It would mean that we would easily be able to replace implementations
for various core modules without needing to touch the rest.  For
instance, when diva started to tackle the world map issue, she not only
had to build her own world map, but to change the one in the core to not
load.  Had we been under this model, she wouldn't have needed to do that.

Don't fear the projects, more projects don't hurt you. :)
