</I>
It may add a bit of time, but I don't think it would be much.  If going
after build times is a goal, I think that's probably a seperate topic.
Nant (like ant) does a lot of dumb things that waste time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I also tend to think of the current modules in OpenSim/Region/Environment/Modules as fairly core modules that one would 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> expect to be packaged together, and which it would be inconvenient to split up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hmm...that kind of goes against the idea of them being modules, i'd think :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does it?  Isn't this just a convenient way of packaging the core modules that almost everybody is going to need to run 
</I>&gt;<i> their OpenSim (though I would admit that some of the modules in there arguably aren't core...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I feel that what would be really useful is a core mechanism for enabling/disabling modules which doesn't rely on the 
</I>&gt;<i> module itself having that option.  This would be simpler and might make the question of whether there are lots of 
</I>&gt;<i> modules bundled in a single dll moot (since you can just enable/disable them with separate config entries - and storage 
</I>&gt;<i> space for dlls is cheap :-)
</I>
I'd be much more of a fan of having each module a seperate dll.  Files
are cheap too. :)  And that makes it very clear to people what they are
loading, and what they aren't loading.

&gt;<i> Which in itself leads me on to the question of splitting up the massive monolithic config file.  I don't know about 
</I>&gt;<i> other people, but I find it a pain to deal with.  I feel that these kinds of changes would be really valuable whilst 
</I>&gt;<i> rearranging the module spaces is kind of nice to have but doesn't seem the most pressing issue right now.  But that's 
</I>&gt;<i> just my opinion :-)
</I>
I'd be a fan of that as well.  More importantly, I think we need to get
down to 1 config system and 1 plugin system for the project.  Right now
I think we're still at 2 or 3 per, which makes it painful all around.
