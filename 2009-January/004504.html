<PRE>Hi,

I have read through the most recent Office Hour transcript[1] and Cable
Beach was brought up. (Thanks Nebadon!) I'm unable to attend the office
hours, so please allow me to contribute a little to the discussion here.

At this stage, I don't expect Cable Beach to offer better performance
over the existing asset server.

Cable Beach does offer authentication built-in, though. This allows you
to access your assets thorugh external (third-party) applications which
may be other grids, editors, websites offering items for sale, etc.

I suggested testing Cable Beach on some regions on OSGrid to see how
it'll fare under real-world use. I believe Intel is currently using
Cable Beach on their internal grid as well as ScienceSim[2], but I
wanted to supplement that with some testing at OSGrid as well. Setting
this up sooner rather than later could help identify issues introduced
with needed changes, such as converting to Mono.Addins and using
OpenSim's HTTP server.

I figured it's possible to run Cable Beach in parallel with the current
OSGrid asset server (same machine, different machine, up to you), and
point a few regions that get some traffic to use this asset server. The
asset server could use its own database (a copy of the current assets
table?) or point at the current assets DB.

Having said that, the end goal is to replace the existing asset server
with Cable Beach in OpenSim core, and end up with only one asset server.

So as far as I understand, there are two issues with Cable Beach as-is:

1. ExtensionLoader
2. HttpServer

I will have a look[3] at using Mono.Addins instead of ExtensionLoader
in Cable Beach. We can re-evaluate this situation later based on the
results.

Hopefully the upstream HttpServer can be updated as required so the DLL
can be updated in OpenSim. This way the asset server can use the
existing HTTP server.

Any other comments or suggestions to move this forward?

Thanks,
Mike
