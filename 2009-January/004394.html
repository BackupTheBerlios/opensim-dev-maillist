Some issues off the top of my head

1)  Assets still have to be uploaded separately
2)  LSL scripts when run on a public grid usually have built in delays so the process for large builds will be pretty 
slow.  Also, in LSL the file format would have to be pretty simple to be interpretable (parsing XML in LSL in any 
non-hacky way looks.... difficult).

Having said that, I'd be pretty sure that there is general LSL code (though maybe not public?) to do 2) - though it must 
be pretty slow.
