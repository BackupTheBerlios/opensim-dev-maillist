The problem here is that wouldn't actually add much security at all, apart from a very very small security through 
obscurity effect.  All someone would have to do is patch the program to take the user password code out (which to be 
honest is what I would do myself, since it would be a real pita to have to type it every time).

Perhaps we do need to look at the secure inventory issue again, even though the security it offers is imperfect, as 
previously discussed.  To be honest, I don't think that one can do any better without taking the big architectural step 
of transferring responsibility for inventory to the client rather than the server.  And even then, stuff rezzed in an 
'unfriendly' region will always be vulnerable.
