<PRE>On that page it did use to say we used UK spelling, but that seems to have got lost through time. 

On this whole subject I do think we should stay with Uk spelling, but I don't see it as that big a deal, if we all decide to swap to US spellings then so be it.

But I don't agree that US spelling is the standard of open source. I think most opensource projects use it because there are more people in the world that use US spellings than UK. So the people starting those projects use whatever system they are used to. But in my mind that doesn't actually make it a standard per se. If you look at most of the opensource projects that were started by UK/Commonwealth people then they generally use UK spelling (again Ogre being a example). 

But again I think we should just vote and see what the result is. With a majority wins I guess.

anyway.

Wasn't there some kind of coding standards document on the wiki?
ohai! , it's here: <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Coding_standards">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Coding_standards</A>

Might want to move the s vs z debate to the discussion page?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I do agree that it would be best to have one, but its hard to force
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people to use one system if that is different to what they are used to. Its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just natural to spell as you normally do.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But if we are going with one then my vote has to be for UK spelling, as I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; said thats how the project started and to be honest I think it would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wrong to swap it later because as more people joined they decided they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; didn't like the spelling system. We really did have it in the code standards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at one time that we used UK spelling.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And also we have about as many core developers from the UK as anywhere else.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But saying all that in the grand scheme of things this isn't really a big
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deal.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But no I don't think really we can force people to use a different system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of spelling to what they are used to. As I feel as strong about not liking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the US spelling as you do about UK ones.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But I would be extremely sad if all the current code was swapped to US
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; spelling. This was started as a UK project as it was just myself working on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; it at the start.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But its now a international project, let lets try and get as many spelling
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; systems as possible in there, lets even try for different languages ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Honestly, we should pick one and run with it, and I don't really care
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which one. The lack of standardization here causes plenty of confusion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for those of us not in auto-completing environments about which version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to use. :)
