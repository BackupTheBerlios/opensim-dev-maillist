just for info,

&gt;<i> Yay for SIP - we've implemented spatial (server-side mixed) voice for 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim using an unaltered SL client communicating with an voice 
</I>&gt;<i> client using an embedded SIP Client based on pjsip[1]
</I>
also in the Rex prototyping I mentioned earlier (helped with it a bit in 
December and November) we used pjsip, using the python bindings for it - 
eventually the 'simplesip' project which is a Pyrex written lib with 
msrp support on top of pjsip.
 
&gt;<i> For us, Freeswitch[2] turned out to be the best alternative on the 
</I>&gt;<i> server side. We have also implemented a full conference system with a 
</I>&gt;<i> custom freeswitch module, allowing us to do very nifty stuff 
</I>&gt;<i> with creating sub-groups and
</I>
we also ran against Freeswitch, both local and the friendly sip2sip 
online service (to test msrp etc thru two clients behind NAT).
  
&gt;<i> As I said, yay for SIP - I also think we should think a bit about 
</I>&gt;<i> using SIP in other areas of OpenSim, as for example as the.. uhh.. 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol to initiate sessions.
</I>
yep like i think i've rambled here earlier when XMPP was discussed, it 
is interesting how there is overlap with OpenSim and the IM/presence/etc 
techs, as they are largely about presense and communications (albeit 
spatiality and 3d are the other strong aspect in VWs)

&gt;<i> We will follow your development with great interest!
</I>
was good to hear you've done similar things and more too (we didn't 
touch opensim in those experiments at all, just client side stuff).

&gt;<i> /Stefan
</I>
let's keep in touch,
