<PRE>
Some time ago, we did something similar - an LSL script that creates xml for the host prim, and posts it to an 'assembler' that imports the prims into a target OpenSim region. Of course, that could probably be done a bit more directly today, with the REST interfaces.
Beware though, that you need to cenvert the primparams values to opensim xml equivalences, as the object property values you see in the sl GUI are not the same as primparams returns, which in turn is not the same that is sent by the sl protocol - which in turn is not the same as the load-xml values.
 
One exciting, and easier, way to go about it, is the other way around; having an OpenSim region that communicates with an SL object that rezzes objects to copy the OpenSim objects over.

That si a way to manage &gt; things such that they do not have to be built again in SL, Opensim, &gt; etc. I wonder what it would take to create an LSL scrio[pt which &gt; could take a version of the save-xml or save-oar formats suitably &gt; exported to text that could be put in a notecard for an LSL script to read?&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
