<PRE>I think this is a great idea, but the questions that come to mind, are: how is the mapping handled for these sub lists and how does a user say that they don't want these sub lists on their map. I think the number of options required could be quite high and think its something that needs some thought before any attempt to add these functions is made.

That way a larger grid could configure itself and individual regions could join in without requiring an update to a central web site.

 I've just added some very initial support for reading Hypergrid link data from xml files, that includes support for the xml files being on a webserver.

The xml file has a format like:


&lt;Nini&gt;

 &lt;Section Name=&quot;Region1&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;Key Name=&quot;xloc&quot; Value=&quot;1002&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;Key Name=&quot;yloc&quot; Value=&quot;1006&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;Key Name=&quot;externalPort&quot; Value=&quot;9006&quot; /&gt;

   &lt;Key Name=&quot;externalHostName&quot; Value=&quot;osl2.nac.uci.edu&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;Key Name=&quot;localName&quot; Value=&quot;OSGrid-Gateway&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/Section&gt;
 &lt;Section Name=&quot;Region2&quot;&gt; 
   ...
 &lt;/Section&gt;
 ...
&lt;/Nini&gt;

And to make a region load it and create the links, you use the console command:  link-region &lt;URI&gt; [&lt;excludeList&gt;]
 
The excludeList parameter is so that certain links in those xml files are ignored.

With the format: excludeList&lt;xml SectionName&gt;[;&lt;xml SectionName&gt;]. 

The main thinking for this  is so that a single list for a certain group/event could be created. Then everyone interested in it, just adds their own region data to the list. 

But so they can also point their own region at that list, they just add the section name they used to the exclude list, so that it doesn't try to link to itself.
 
If we can find a way of having a xml file on a webserver that people can add new entries to (maybe through a form script). Then I think it would be a good idea to have such a list for OpenSim's 2nd birthday.

 Although this idea really needs some sort of automapping or at least better configuration of the map locations that the regions are placed at. 

I think if everyone just agrees that a certain area on the map [so say x,y - x+25, y+25] is reserved for link regions, that it is workable for now.
