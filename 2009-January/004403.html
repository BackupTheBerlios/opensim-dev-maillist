<PRE>And don't forget to get the right AssetTypeIDs in both or you will end up
with, say, animations that show as images and other weirdness.

Personally, I have moved away from adding things to the stock inventory in
favor of looking at ways to make content more transportable on its own.
There are still some things desperately needed in stock content, however, I
have a bunch of waves and other expected basics so one need not rely on
Linden default animations and have begun some gestures. The hassle with
creating patches for stock content submissions has largely kept me lazy
enough from following through.

Thanks for the link Justin.
