<PRE>Hi,

I don't think there's enough difference between &quot;resolved&quot; and
&quot;resolution pending test&quot;. Also I don't think we need to complicate
our workflow any more for a couple reasons:

First, we don't have a dedicated QA team that will go through all
&quot;resolution pending test&quot; tickets and verify them, and apparently the
originals submitters don't care enough most of the time either.

Second, what's so difficult with re-opening an issue that's been
resolved if the problem is not fixed? Since most of the time the
problem *is* fixed, why add this extra policy overhead for the few
cases where it isn't fixed?

Third, if your issue was &quot;resolved&quot; by a developer who submitted a
patch, or *gasp* even &quot;closed&quot; (if it was Justin, perhaps) without the
issue being fixed, it's not the end of the world. Don't take it
personally. Give the developer the benefit of the doubt, and ask
yourself why the developer felt the issue was fixed. Maybe the
description of the bug was inadequate? Maybe a better test case or
clearer steps to reproduce, expected and actual results would help
everyone understand the issue better? After reviewing the information
in the bug and the proposed fix, you can provide constructive comments
when you reopen the issue.

Thanks,
Mike
