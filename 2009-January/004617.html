<PRE>Yeah I wasn't really being serious that we should try to get as many spelling systems or langauges as we can.

So I do agree that it would be best to have one, but its hard to force people to use one system if that is different to what they are used to. Its just natural to spell as you normally do.

But if we are going with one then my vote has to be for UK spelling, as I said thats how the project started and to be honest I think it would be wrong to swap it later because as more people joined they decided they didn't like the spelling system. We really did have it in the code standards at one time that we used UK spelling. 

And also we have about as many core developers from the UK as anywhere else.

But saying all that in the grand scheme of things this isn't really a big deal.

Honestly, we should pick one and run with it, and I don't really care
which one.  The lack of standardization here causes plenty of confusion
for those of us not in auto-completing environments about which version
to use. :)
