<PRE>
 
&gt;<i> &gt; not by &gt; &gt; looking it up and dumping it, but by generating it in code, just as &gt; &gt; almost any web page is generated today.&gt; &gt; Was the asset data for the model be embedded in the xml, or was that fetched separately by GETting embedded urls?
</I>Actually, both, since this was based off the save-xml xml, assets where just refeerenced in the objects by uuid, but the actual asset references came along in a separate element under the root. If my memory serves me right, we adressed the injection issue by treating the guis as local for the xml doc, ie, regenerating all ids on load.
 
BUT
 
I do think that whatever we do from now on should strive towards supporting url schemes for resource location. So, the sop/sog protocol should be expanded to supporting urls as well as guids forr asset ids.
