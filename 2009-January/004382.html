<PRE>
Justin,
 
is there any way that we could use these commands to get additions to the default library going?
 
What would it take, today, to take content that has been added to a grid, and extract it in a format that would easily be added to the default library and default asset trees, preferrably in the form of a patch?
Could I persuade you to write a wiki page that would describe such a procedure?Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB

This was the kind of problem that the secure inventory facility aimed to &gt; address but which we ended up having problems with for one reason or another. I don't know if there were other problems &gt; with that, but even that wouldn't address the issue if someone wandered in to a sim operated by a malicious or simply &gt; curious person.&gt; &gt; -- &gt; justincc&gt; Justin Clark-Casey&gt; <A HREF="http://justincc.wordpress.com">http://justincc.wordpress.com</A>&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
