It is not just some gadget.  Just because it doesn't pass your personal
litmus
test, does not make it unworthy.

Lets leave aside the client side for a moment.  Others will grab the
SnowGlobe
source and do a 2.x generation viewer that can access the new features, and
give us the best of both worlds.. client and server side.  That's a given.
We're
not going to have to suffer with the SL 2.x viewer for that long...

The important issue here is that people who wish to do presentations,
museums
and all manner of rich media work, can suddenly do that in SL.  That is a
great
step forward.  You would not believe how many meetings I have been in where
people are pining for that...

But, the real holy grail is to be able to do that, and benefit from all of
the flexibility
(and cost savings) of working in the OpenSim environment.  It's not a
gadget.
It's a game changer, and much better minds than mine have outlined exactly
why [1]

Dont confuse the new functionality with the old non-interactive web on a
prim (which
also sucked up the parcel media channel).  That was a gadget.

But now we're there ;)  The real thing is interactive and worth it to lots
of interested parties.
