The idea was to make an official release for 0.6.9 soon after the merge 
happened, that's why Melanie branched 0.6.9-post-fixes before the merge. 
6 of the 12 points in here
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Release_Cycle">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Release_Cycle</A>
have been followed already, namely 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
But no one took charge of the effort, so it fell flat.

OK, as you wish. I'm going to go ahead and start planning 0.7.
