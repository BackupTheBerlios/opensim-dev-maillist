<PRE>*&gt; First stage of the new interactive region creation.*

This sounds extremely interesting.  Interactive region creation sounds like
an excellent idea.

Will this by any chance allow interactive &quot;on-demand&quot; region loading?

If you calculate just the total LAND area of Earth is 148,940,000 km&#178;, or
approximately 29.2% of earth's surface (510,072,000 km&#178;).  Which would
require almost 4 Trillion (3,969,931,719,726) 1km x 1km square regions (or
approximately 64 Trillion 256mx256m regions).

As virtual content developers (and architects) slowly begin designing
realistic content (and region/land terrain data to create virtual land based
on GIS imagery &amp; elevation data), it's very easy to see how scalability
problems can become a major issue with the current architecture.  At the
present moment, OpenSim consumes way too many system resources, and requires
way too many servers to do anything large scale (like model a planet).

It would be nice if idle regions didn't use any system resources on a server
and could be loaded &quot;on demand&quot; (like web pages) as a user teleports into an
idle region, then the region would automatically be started/loaded.  This
way idle regions don't consume any resources on the server.  Idle regions
would need to shut down automatically (after a &quot;time out&quot; period) and not
consume any system resources while idle regions are unused and idle.  Then
loaded (on-demand) as users enter an idle region.

As users enter an idle region (or a nearby region) then the regions would be
started up automatically (on demand), so that the regions can be accessed.
 Similar to how web pages don't require any system resources (other than
hard drive space) until they are accessed/served to users.  It would be nice
to have idle regions not consume any system resources so that we can begin
modeling large-scale land or even space region areas, such as a large
cities, planets, solar systems, or even forests without having to waste
large amounts of server equipment (for idle regions with no active users).

This way large-scale areas (like Yellowstone, or large cities or even
planets like Mars) could be developed, and could be run on one or two
servers, and hundreds or thousands of connecting regions (just like millions
of web pages on a server) could be stored on only a few servers and regions
could simply load (on-demand) as needed.

This way you could store thousands of region areas on a SINGLE server
(similar to a web server), and all the idle regions wouldn't use any system
resources unless a user enters or teleports to an idle/empty region. Then
the region would be started up (on-the-fly) so the user can access the
region.

Then have &quot;time-out&quot; periods for regions, in the region configuration file,
so if a region stays empty or idle for more than 30 minutes (user
configurable) then the idle region would shut down to conserve system
resources.

This way only active regions are loaded (and running) and idle regions are
unloaded (and not consuming any system resources on the server).
