<PRE>Starting a new thread on this, as its likely to be a long running 
thread of discussion I would imagine.

Here is a summary of some web interfaces in use or under development 
that are known about... and what I hope are useful entry points into 
the Opensim Wiki.

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Webinterface">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Webinterface</A>
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Known_Web_Interfaces_within_OpenSim">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Known_Web_Interfaces_within_OpenSim</A>

We tried (three times) to get OpensimWI going in our setup, and each 
time it corrupted some elements  of our data bases, losing some 
aspects of users and their setup.  But with help form New World Grid 
folks, we did extract elements related to groups and offline IM and 
use those in a very simple web environment for opensim 0.6.6 on to 
0.6.8 successfully.

We have also been watching and commenting on Opensim web iterfaces in 
use or now under development for

a) The web front end for New World Grid at  <A HREF="http://www.newwqridgrid.com">http://www.newwqridgrid.com</A>

b) the Drupal for Opensim (d4os) new web interface using Drupal 
modules under development at <A HREF="http://drupal.org/project/d4os">http://drupal.org/project/d4os</A>

There are also new developments by various teams such as GridMix and 
HWIOS by folks active in the Opensim development coommunity.

What is needed is simple web modules that can be re purposed easily 
and included in any sort of content management and hosting 
environment (basically any web server/Apache, MySQL, PHP environment, 
including Drupal, Joomla, etc too)
