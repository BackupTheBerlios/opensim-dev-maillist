Yes I think that would be good Justin. We are running our Openvue 
grid on 0.6.8 postfixes from December and its been very stable except 
for the issue we never managed to pin down about communications drop 
outs between the M and U services after logins, which as you know you 
spent considerable personal time trying to track down too.  We are 
both hoping it will just &quot;go away&quot; with the full ROBUST 0.7 setup.

I would be happy to move to a 0.6.9 post fixes release as a test when 
its stable to feed back on that ahead of getting ready to refactor 
for the full ROBUST 0.7.  Some clear instructions on anything that 
has altered between 0.6.8 postfixes and the 0.6.9 release would be 
helpful, and I will; follow those instructions and give feedback.
