<PRE>Hello,
I apologize in advance for asking these 'noob' questions on this dev list.
I am exploring opensim and planning an exit strategy from my 5 year long
Second Life presence because of the costs of keeping 5 sims up. A lot of
peer instructional technology depts are in the same position as my own (and
it is a growing list), and we really cannot afford Second Life, and we are
looking for cheaper hosting solutions.  A few reasons that kept me from
exploring open sim in the past are :
1 LSL not completely supported meant that a lot of our existing content
would break,
2 lack of physics support meant that none of our vehicles could work,
3 I heard voice communication is not spatial (please correct me if I am
wrong),
4. media playback not as straightforward as in SL(please correct me here,
going by hearsay), and now unfortunately
5. shared media on a prim (are there any solutions in the works for viewers
used to access opensim?) is an SL only solution.

Also, is there a place where I can go to buy products made opensim
inhabitants, I hear some opensim grids support 'PayPal' transactions, so I
am guessing there should be a site somewhere that catalogs the products...

One thing that is really attractive to me regarding opensim is the hypergrid
functionality. And the fact that countries that would want to join the
virtual environment adventure from africa (am from Mauritius) would find
that locally hosted opensim solutions might actually offer better response
times than when trying to access Second Life servers.
There is a lot things for me to learn as you can see. Are there pointers to
sites with information about to ease the transition for migrants from Second
Life?
