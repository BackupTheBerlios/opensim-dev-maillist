Subject: [Opensim-dev] OpenSimulator 0.7.6.1 and 0.7.5.1 now available
Message-ID: <52EC4579.8020002@googlemail.com>

Hi folks.  As previously discussed [1], OpenSimulator 0.7.6.1 is now available with release notes at [2].

This is a minor point release which contains only a few bug fix changes.  The chief of these (and the reason for making 
this release) is one which fixes exceptions and appearance failures if an avatar teleports from a simulator running 
current development code to one running OpenSimulator 0.7.6.

As such, you don't need to update unless you may receive users from such simulators via Hypergrid or if you are on an 
open grid (such as OSGrid).  For more details, please see [1].  That said, there is a fix for a memory leak on maptile 
generation with the default generators which might be useful.

Because there are few changes, it will be possible to copy over existing config files from 0.7.6.  But as always, please 
backup your database before performing any updates.

The same appearance fix has also been applied to 0.7.5.1, which is a similar minor bug fix release on to of 0.7.5. 
Release notes for that are at [3].  As yet, there are no plans to go back and patch older releases since it's better to 
spend that time fixing current code.
