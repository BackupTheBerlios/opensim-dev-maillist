<PRE>I agree on  getting it working first. I also consider OGP and HG2 
mutually exclusive and don't foresee a region wanting to have both.

</I>&gt;<i> is suggesting that we move towards getting the Hypergrid work into  
</I>&gt;<i> the IETF, through this newly created OGPX working group.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I think this is all premature. IETF-ing the Hypergrid is  
</I>&gt;<i> premature for different reasons than IETF-ing OGP is premature. The  
</I>&gt;<i> Hypergrid is not really ready for prime time until we have the  
</I>&gt;<i> Hypergrid2 in place, with its security model to protect users from  
</I>&gt;<i> malicious simulators. OGP is not ready for prime time because no one  
</I>&gt;<i> has seen it yet, at least not any reasonably complete implementation  
</I>&gt;<i> of it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The right thing to do, I think, is to first have implementations of  
</I>&gt;<i> both OGP and the Hypergrid2 in OpenSim. Once that is in place, we can  
</I>&gt;<i> all see the similarities and differences, and try to standardize the  
</I>&gt;<i> similar pieces. Alternatively, we can try to work together towards  
</I>&gt;<i> one single interop protocol, but honestly I think that's not going to  
</I>&gt;<i> happen, simply because there is space for many (not just 2, but 3 or 4)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I suspect will happen is that OGP and the Hypergrid will have  
</I>&gt;<i> several pieces that are very much in sync, with small details that  
</I>&gt;<i> are different, and then they will have a few really important pieces  
</I>&gt;<i> that are substantially different. Things like posting/retrieving  
</I>&gt;<i> agents to/from regions, for example, we already converged to using  
</I>&gt;<i> REST; inventory access, we already converged to using capability  
</I>&gt;<i> URLs, etc. Small details such as the format of the data on the wire  
</I>&gt;<i> are different, but that doesn't really matter as long as we agree  
</I>&gt;<i> that the Content-type can be set to different things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The thing that will be substantially different is the issue of  
</I>&gt;<i> authority: what component has authority to do what. In OGP regions  
</I>&gt;<i> are still the ones doing agent transfers, therefore implying a trust  
</I>&gt;<i> relation between interacting grids that must be established in some  
</I>&gt;<i> non-technical manner (i.e. the receiving region trusts that the  
</I>&gt;<i> sending region is not stealing the user's identity). In the  
</I>&gt;<i> Hypergrid, agent transfers between non-trusting regions are done on  
</I>&gt;<i> the client side, so that the identity of the user can always be  
</I>&gt;<i> verified, there is no region in the middle acting on behalf of anyone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, that's the main difference, as far as I understand OGP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Hypergrid2 is in place through a proof-of-concept prototype  
</I>&gt;<i> client (Grider) and a couple of small but horrible hacks in OpenSim.  
</I>&gt;<i> OGP implementations don't exist yet, or they are not available to us  
</I>&gt;<i> which is the same. I think there's a lot of work to do before we go  
</I>&gt;<i> and propose any of this as standards.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I thought I'd bring this up for discussion. Maybe other people  
</I>&gt;<i> aren't as strict on working implementations as I am.
