<PRE>I was curious to understand the current status of OpenSim on Linux
architectures (such as Linux Red Hat Enterprise 5 or similar) using 64
bit to access all the available memory.
Browsing the documentation it seems that OpenSim can run under 64 bit,
but I've seen MANY mantis referring to problems with 64 bit
compilation and running.
Also in the past I've seen some people dropping their 64 bit regions
(and installing instead 32 bit version) because they didn't work as
expected (instability, strange collision effects etc).
I've also seen a 32bit-OpenSim-launcher.exe (or something similar) who
allegedly can run opensim in 32 bit mode even on 64 bit systems, but
do not know if this applies only to 64-bit windows or also to linux
systems. There is some information on the wiki, but it appears quite
outdated right now.

So the question is: if people want to install opensim on a 64 bit
system with say 8 Gbram, what do you suggest?
1\ don't even think that throw away 64 bit system and use a 32 bit
system using just the 3.5 G ram it can access?
2\ use some tricks to launch opensim.exe as if it were a 32 bit?
3\ install 32 bit OS and use some tricks to make it see the memory beyond 3.5 G?
4\ go on and use 64 bit system it works like a charme and all the
MANTIS and the old problems had vanished in the void? :)

Thanks for any suggestion on that and if you already run OpenSim on
RedHat 64 bit if you have any suggestions...
