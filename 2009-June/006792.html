Personally, I would be in favour of some kind of 'automatic subdivision' of folders. Eg, when you take an object to inventory, it gets default saved into a folder for the week. (eg, 'Objects' -&gt; 'From 2009/15' -&gt; 'Object Name' [if the folder doesn't exist, create it.])

I don't think we should be deciding such things in the core, as different application might not want it to work like that. So I think really something like that is a grid/application decision. So if we want to do something like that then at least make it a option.



Similarly, with the client talking directly to the inventory server,
which I agree in the context of a SL type application is a good thing.
But for some other applications it might not be what is wanted. The
application that is running on the region might need some control over
at least part of the inventory. Or maybe it will want to give the user
a temporary folder for use while that user is in that region. Some of
the custom applications I've done in the past use these types of
systems. And I could imagine a multi user game maybe wanting to use it.

So I'm all for improving inventory as long as we don't just think of
one use case and make it so that its hard to change how things work for
other applications. Of course with the new service connectors it should
be quite easy to change how it all is handled. So I'm just giving a
small reminder that we shouldn't get set into a certain mindset for one
single application.
