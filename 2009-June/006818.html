<PRE>Hello,

a patch that has a cautionary note and also sports an exception 
dump, wich makes it risky, will normally not go in easily.

Also, please do NOT submit patches for post-fixes, any patches that 
you want to have any chance of going in have to be against trunk always.

Please make a version against trunk that either has no database 
changes at all, or implements all changes against both SQLite and 
MySQL. That is mandatory for your patch to be considered.

Please ensure it's tested thoroughly, so it won't eat anyone's babies.

Also, a presence in IRC can halp your case, as you can talk to 
committers there and get the reservations cleared up.

Melanie
