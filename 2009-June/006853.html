I'll add in my 2 cents based on the code the Unit tests tickle frequently.

Mono 2.2 on 64bit Linux is provably wrong.  It gets some types wrong in
the database paths, which can be seen with a simple unit test set.  This
is the only revision of Mono that I've seen have this issue.

Mono 2.4 has a race on method unloading, which gets exposed by nunit a
lot, though it's unclear how often it would show up in opensim in
general.  Mono 2.4.2 rc2 seems to have addressed that on my machines,
though I still see an issue on the main panda from time to time (it at
least has gotten better).

Previously Mono 2.0.1 was the pinnacle of stability for both 32 and 64
bit for me.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
