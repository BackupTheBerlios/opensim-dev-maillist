<PRE>Guys,
Thanks for all your help on this! I wanted to provide you with the
information regarding what we are aiming to achieve with the school. I hope
the info below sheds light on what you guys think would be the best solution
to my challenge. Let me know what you guys think!




*1. How many users at one time will be logged in at the same time*

For the fall semester, we may have up to 3 simultaneous classes of 20
students, plus teachers and observers, so perhaps up to 70 users.  A few
additional students not attending a class session may also be logging in at
the same time to work on assignments etc.  We will try to stagger the class
schedules to reduce the number of users on the server at any one given time,
but the 3 class scenario is may happen on occasion.

*2. How much material / baggage will each avatar have (10 outfits, 100
outfits, etc.)*

This will increase over time as we fill out the sim.  Initially I think each
avatar's inventory will be pretty limited.  Students will need enough
variety to allow 20 individuals to mix and match outfits pieces to look
unique (or at least distinguishable ).  Over time we would like to develop
additional items and outfits that students can earn for completing
assignments, good grades, etc.

In addition to outfits, students will probably accumulate a certain number
of items as they complete class activities.  For example, if the class
activity is to go to the market and collect items on a shopping list, these
could start to pile up in their inventories.

*3. How many classes will be handled at one given time*

For the fall semester, 3 simultaneous classes of 20 students + 1 teacher
will probably be the max.  This is simply because our teachers will be
working in shifts and sharing three workstations here in Beijing.

*4. How big is the pipeline between the kids home to the server*

There is probably going to be some variation here.  Some kids may be logging
in from well equipped school computer labs for class sessions, others may be
logging in from home to do an assignment or have a tutoring session.

</I>&gt;<i> grid at a time thats a completely different scenario then having all 800
</I>&gt;<i> on at once.  If you only need 30 to 60, I would suggest 4 to 6 regions
</I>&gt;<i> with no more then 2 per OpenSim instance.  This way they can all spread
</I>&gt;<i> out when doing work, and not be crowded.  A properly constructed lecture
</I>&gt;<i> hall at the corners of 4 regions (each hosted on a separate server)
</I>&gt;<i> would allow 30 to 60 students to gather to participate in a large event,
</I>&gt;<i> while still spreading their concurrent load across multiple regions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Documentation is still pretty light on the entire system, but I would
</I>&gt;<i> look at the &quot;Standalone vs Grid&quot; section on this page:
