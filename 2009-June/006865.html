<PRE>Hi,

 

I don't want to spoil the show for OpenSim here, but if you really want
800 users in a virtual world there is no way around ActiveWorlds
(<A HREF="http://activeworlds.com/">http://activeworlds.com/</A> ) - at least that's how IBM does it according
to David van Gent. When it comes to user number of 50 or higher at one
place, they switch to ActiveWorlds. It is an old but very proven
technology that is very affordable.

 

Again, I am not promoting AW being a big OpenSim fan myself (
<A HREF="http://web3dblog.wordpress.com">http://web3dblog.wordpress.com</A> ) but if you want to get the job done,
you might consider AW.  I didn't try it myself but filed it under 'you
need that for large numbers'

 

If you want to have it based on OpenSim for some reason, ignore this
comment here J.

 

Best,

  Dirk

Hi Nebadon,

 

Thanks for your info, it's really shedding light on this issue. I might
not of explained what I am after in detail. I am not looking to run 1
sim, I am looking to run multiple sims that will handle the load of 800
users. I do not know how to make those sims (not regions I know how to
make the xml file and make another island) but the server side software
connect together on one machine to handle the load. To make that type of
grid, does anyone know where we could actually obtain those servers?
Regarding asset storage, we do not anticipate the students really doing
anything except for coming into this area and meet with their teachers
for a presentation. Let me know what you guys think, as I am trying to
find the best solution for the school. Thanks!

At this current time getting 800 people into 1 region is going to be
virtually impossible, even with the load balance the region max limit is
probably going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of around 100 users
max per 1 region, without load balancing your going to get about 30-40
users max per region.  And really these limits are only going to apply
if your all your doing is standing around chatting, if your expecting
people to be able to build and script you can cut these numbers way down
depending on your hardware your deploying.  My guess though even if you
could get 800 people into 1 region (Highly Unlikley it will ever happen
honestly) you are likely to have other issues with chat and being able
to actually control communications with such large crowds. I hate to say
it but OpenSimulator is really in no way capable of housing such a large
production at this time nor likely will be anytime in the near future
either.  If your talking about 800 students spread out over an entire
grid all not in the same 1 region then that is more realistic but the
same math will apply, your going to need a good 30 regions with all
having 1 core of CPU power and aprox 2gb ram per region if your
expecting 800 users, and your going to need fairly beefy Asset services
with lots of storage space.  Anyway if you have more questions about it
please let us know.
