<PRE>At this current time getting 800 people into 1 region is going to be
virtually impossible, even with the load balance the region max limit is
probably going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of around 100 users max
per 1 region, without load balancing your going to get about 30-40 users max
per region.  And really these limits are only going to apply if your all
your doing is standing around chatting, if your expecting people to be able
to build and script you can cut these numbers way down depending on your
hardware your deploying.  My guess though even if you could get 800 people
into 1 region (Highly Unlikley it will ever happen honestly) you are likely
to have other issues with chat and being able to actually control
communications with such large crowds. I hate to say it but OpenSimulator is
really in no way capable of housing such a large production at this time nor
likely will be anytime in the near future either.  If your talking about 800
students spread out over an entire grid all not in the same 1 region then
that is more realistic but the same math will apply, your going to need a
good 30 regions with all having 1 core of CPU power and aprox 2gb ram per
region if your expecting 800 users, and your going to need fairly beefy
Asset services with lots of storage space.  Anyway if you have more
questions about it please let us know.
