<PRE>Hi Robert,

First, we are sorry if no one ever got to your patch in time and would
appreciate your understanding that there is no real applying patch
system or fixed core developers &quot;patch applying&quot; hours. We do it in
amidst of all other kinds of work, and sometimes it coincidentally
happens that all core developers are working on something else and are
thinking someone else is probably looking at the community patches.

Melanie suggested your presence on IRC to talk to us commiters directly
if you think we are taking too long to look at your code. We ask that
people do that only if they few they it's taking too long to get a
feedback, we don't want to be flooded in &quot;hey, I've got a patch&quot;
messages :)
Go ahead and ping us, the worst you might get is we can't attend to you
at the moment. But out of all the commiters, you should find someone in
a coffee break that will probably have the good will (and knowledge in
that area) to give you feedback and/or commit. 

As Melanie mentioned, patches must be made against trunk. If trunk
doesn't compile, something is wrong in your machine, because we only
submit source code that compiles (it just might not work). So you should
be always updating a trunk copy and seeing if it's working. If not, ask
around and look in Mantis for the reason.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know what are you talking about, my patch doesn't cause those things.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, please do NOT submit patches for post-fixes, any patches that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you want to have any chance of going in have to be against trunk always.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Over a week ago I made a version of my patch for the trunk, but nobody
</I>&gt;<i> cared to check it out.
</I>&gt;<i> And as I wrote in my previous email, if anybody is interested I will
</I>&gt;<i> make updated version of my
</I>&gt;<i> patch for the current revision of the trunk.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please make a version against trunk that either has no database
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changes at all, or implements all changes against both SQLite and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MySQL. That is mandatory for your patch to be considered.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> My patch doesn't touches database code. There are only comments in
</I>&gt;<i> SQLiteRegionData.cs - I would like somebody to explain me why OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> behaves that way. But again there are only comments, you can ignore this file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please ensure it's tested thoroughly, so it won't eat anyone's babies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> All tests pass on trunk code, with one change in one test in
</I>&gt;<i> BasicRegionTest.cs, I made this change because this test is badly written
</I>&gt;<i> in my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> Besides, my code works correctly in OpenSim server (0.6.5-post-fixes)
</I>&gt;<i> and in a viewer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, a presence in IRC can halp your case, as you can talk to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; committers there and get the reservations cleared up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Why should I hang out on IRC if nobody cares about my patches.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Melanie
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your answer,
