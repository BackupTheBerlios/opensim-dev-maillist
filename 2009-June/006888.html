<PRE>Dear Andrew:

I would suggest discussing this with James (Hiro) would be a good thing. He has setup a couple of grids and has quite a bit of experience.

Charles

Hi Charles,

Thanks for your info. I believe after discussions with people on this listserv it might be best to discuss having someone build the grid for us and my team develop the world. I am thinking that we should use two servers at first and make sure that it is able to be expanded easily. I am not sold on using 1and1 company for hosting, but I just want to make sure I pull the trigger and it is the right decision.

Does anyone able to compile a version of the opensim with the audio chat integration? I know Kyle Gomboy has successfully pull this off (Good Job Reaction Grid!).

Let me know what you guys suggest for my challenge.

Dear Andrew:

All my personal experience is with Linux servers, but there are lots of folks that use Windows servers. The choice of operating system is more a religious discussion then a technical discussion.

If you are having problems with 20 avatars, then something is not right.

Each week at &quot;Office Hour&quot; on Wright Plaza we regularly have about 20 avatars. And in addition, we have hundreds of scripts and thousands of prims. So, my personal opinion on reliability is based on the performance each Tuesday of &quot;Wright Plaza&quot;.

Personally, I tend to favor Carinet, but there are lots of hosting companies available. The trick is to get a server with as much memory as you can afford. Budget *at least* 2GByte of RAM per region.

Its not tough to setup a grid. The details are on the wiki at opensimulator.org. One thing to do is to consider running the five grid executables, known as a UGAIM for User, Grid, Asset, Inventory &amp; Messaging on a seperate server then any regions for best results.

MCortez is around this mailing list and will probably reply next (or at least soon).

Hi Chris,

Thanks for your comments!

Right now my thought was the 4 sim islands. We were going to use a windows server to run these. Would that be an issue?

I am thinking that your solution is probably best. Does anyone know any cost effective server hosting companies?

My thought exactly about balancing the users to only have access to a certain island (or conduct classes that way so that we can balance the load during classes).

I just want to make sure we can expand as the program grows for the school. I hate to provide them with this solution and find out we cannot scale up to their needs in the future.

Does anyone know how I can contact McCortez?

Sadly, I just was running a LAN version in a classroom with 20 kids... It crashed over and over (0.6.5) and was so slow we could not even get the kids in. This was a test to see what we could handle in the school with one server. It scares me to see this situation, and hopefully by getting this advice I can help these school have this as a distance learning service within this VW. 

My guess is to run a grid. It's easy to make the regions, but again that is still using 1 server and seems to not like to play nice with me right now. lol

Well, let me jump in here a little bit.

If I were going to set this up, I would start with four OpenSim regions, each running on a different Linux server.

I would put them in a square and make the landing point at the four-corner junction. 

I would then make each of the four regions a seperate classroom and plan on reliably handling 20-30 simultaneous in each of the four regions.

When I had sufficient experience, i.e. one quarter (or semester), then I would consider expanding (or coalescing two regions into one server) based on the quarter's (or semester's) reliability or stability.

I think MCortez said something very similar to this a few posts ago and he would tend to know also.

Charles

p.s. At this point, one can expect to handle 20 avatars simultaneously in one region comfortably.

p.p.s 40 Avatars simultaneous in one region is 'iffy'.

p.p.p.s One can have as many regions as one has servers to serve them from.

p.p.p.p.s I would probably run a grid and allow this grid to connect regions rather then running a number of standalones.

Guys,

Thanks for all your help on this! I wanted to provide you with the information regarding what we are aiming to achieve with the school. I hope the info below sheds light on what you guys think would be the best solution to my challenge. Let me know what you guys think!




1. How many users at one time will be logged in at the same time

For the fall semester, we may have up to 3 simultaneous classes of 20 students, plus teachers and observers, so perhaps up to 70 users.  A few additional students not attending a class session may also be logging in at the same time to work on assignments etc.  We will try to stagger the class schedules to reduce the number of users on the server at any one given time, but the 3 class scenario is may happen on occasion.


2. How much material / baggage will each avatar have (10 outfits, 100 outfits, etc.)

This will increase over time as we fill out the sim.  Initially I think each avatar's inventory will be pretty limited.  Students will need enough variety to allow 20 individuals to mix and match outfits pieces to look unique (or at least distinguishable ).  Over time we would like to develop additional items and outfits that students can earn for completing assignments, good grades, etc.

In addition to outfits, students will probably accumulate a certain number of items as they complete class activities.  For example, if the class activity is to go to the market and collect items on a shopping list, these could start to pile up in their inventories.


3. How many classes will be handled at one given time

For the fall semester, 3 simultaneous classes of 20 students + 1 teacher will probably be the max.  This is simply because our teachers will be working in shifts and sharing three workstations here in Beijing.


4. How big is the pipeline between the kids home to the server
There is probably going to be some variation here.  Some kids may be logging in from well equipped school computer labs for class sessions, others may be logging in from home to do an assignment or have a tutoring session.

</I>OpenSim itself includes the executables necessary to create a grid and
have multiple OpenSim instances (each with 1 or more regions) connect
together.  These are what you would normally call the UGAIM (User Grid
Asset Inventory Messaging) services.  These services will need at least
one server to run on, along with a database server such as MySQL or MSSQL.

You mention 800 students, do you know what kind of concurrency you
need?  If your talking about only 30 to 60 students being live on the
grid at a time thats a completely different scenario then having all 800
on at once.  If you only need 30 to 60, I would suggest 4 to 6 regions
with no more then 2 per OpenSim instance.  This way they can all spread
out when doing work, and not be crowded.  A properly constructed lecture
hall at the corners of 4 regions (each hosted on a separate server)
would allow 30 to 60 students to gather to participate in a large event,
while still spreading their concurrent load across multiple regions.

Documentation is still pretty light on the entire system, but I would
look at the &quot;Standalone vs Grid&quot; section on this page:
