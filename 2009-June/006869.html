</I>OpenSim itself includes the executables necessary to create a grid and 
have multiple OpenSim instances (each with 1 or more regions) connect 
together.  These are what you would normally call the UGAIM (User Grid 
Asset Inventory Messaging) services.  These services will need at least 
one server to run on, along with a database server such as MySQL or MSSQL.

You mention 800 students, do you know what kind of concurrency you 
need?  If your talking about only 30 to 60 students being live on the 
grid at a time thats a completely different scenario then having all 800 
on at once.  If you only need 30 to 60, I would suggest 4 to 6 regions 
with no more then 2 per OpenSim instance.  This way they can all spread 
out when doing work, and not be crowded.  A properly constructed lecture 
hall at the corners of 4 regions (each hosted on a separate server) 
would allow 30 to 60 students to gather to participate in a large event, 
while still spreading their concurrent load across multiple regions.

Documentation is still pretty light on the entire system, but I would 
look at the &quot;Standalone vs Grid&quot; section on this page:
