<PRE>Here are my 2 cents.
I want to state that what I wrote is hypothetical,
I don't judge anybody.

I can understand that someone leaves open source
project because he can't kick out developers who
are screwing his project.
But I will never understand leaving a project because
someone didn't apologized to me, it looks capricious.

This is what I would do if I were you, I would ask Gforge Admin to give me
the right to kick out anybody from my projects (i.e. remove somebody's
commit right),
I assume that you are lead developer on those
projects. Then, if I didn't get this right I would have good reason
to leave my project, because I can't trust some of the developers.

Fly Man, your decision looks capricious to me, and I have news for you,
jerks do not apologize, and there is a lot of jerks in this world,
so get used to it.

Again, what I wrote is hypothetical, I don't judge anybody.

Word &quot;capricious&quot; was translated from Polish by Google translator,
so if I didn't use a proper word don't blame me, blame Google ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> This morning I released the 10 developers that were working on various

</I>&gt;<i> * All other projects that I did are in private mode and can be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
