<PRE>Hi,

Just a brief note to explain some of the reasoning behind the new .ini's 
that are being put into place, and why some come out of svn as .example 
and some don't.

Basically, those that come out of svn as .ini are not supposed to be 
changed ever. The ones that come out as ini.example are supposed to be 
changed.

If you ever feel the need to change one of those .ini's that *don't* 
come with the .example extension, then you are a power user and you are 
defining your own architecture that is neither standalone, grid or 
hypergrid. In that case don't change them, still. What you need to do is 
to copy the .ini file of interest into another .ini with another name 
and include that one in the [Architecture] section of OpenSim.ini. Once 
you do that, you have all the freedom to configure the many variables 
that can be configured, however you like.

All of this will be documented eventually for the power users. For most 
users, the 3 pre-packaged architectures are enough, and they will become 
even easier to configure as we go along. Just thought I'd send this note 
in case there are already people out there wanting to change connector 
and service dlls, and using hybrid architectures.
