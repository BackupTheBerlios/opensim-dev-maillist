<PRE>Hello people,

I was investigating some physical avatar behavior with ODE and managed to
fix the avatar capsule tilt that causes Mantis #2905 to occur and also
causes other inconsistency in avatar movement (e.g. sometimes not being able
to pass through thin passages). However, I noticed that the fixing the
capsule tilt seems to cause the avatar to sink into the terrain if the slope
is steep. I suspect that there may be some &quot;fudge factors&quot; in the physics
code that were tuned to work with the leaning capsule which may need to be
re-tuned, but I am not sure at this point.

Removing the capsule tilt results in a consistently-behaving,
straight-upright capsule. Even though this behavior is on the whole
preferable, it may cause some hiccups for anything that was tuned to work
with the old leaning avatar capsule.

I was planning on going ahead and committing this patch. To avoid breaking
anything that depends on the current behavior I will add an option to
OpenSim.ini in the [ODEPhysicsSettings] section, something like
&quot;av_capsule_tilted = true&quot; as the default with no change in behavior, and
&quot;false&quot; as the corrected but not yet thoroughly verified mode. If no
problems arise, we can later change &quot;false&quot; to the default.

Any objections?

Thanks,
N Lin (nlin)
