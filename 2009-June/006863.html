<PRE>Hi Nebadon,
Thanks for your info, it's really shedding light on this issue. I might not
of explained what I am after in detail. I am not looking to run 1 sim, I am
looking to run multiple sims that will handle the load of 800 users. I do
not know how to make those sims (not regions I know how to make the xml file
and make another island) but the server side software connect together on
one machine to handle the load. To make that type of grid, does anyone know
where we could actually obtain those servers? Regarding asset storage, we do
not anticipate the students really doing anything except for coming into
this area and meet with their teachers for a presentation. Let me know what
you guys think, as I am trying to find the best solution for the school.
Thanks!

</I>&gt;<i> really in no way capable of housing such a large production at this time nor
</I>&gt;<i> likely will be anytime in the near future either.  If your talking about 800
</I>&gt;<i> students spread out over an entire grid all not in the same 1 region then
</I>&gt;<i> that is more realistic but the same math will apply, your going to need a
</I>&gt;<i> good 30 regions with all having 1 core of CPU power and aprox 2gb ram per
</I>&gt;<i> region if your expecting 800 users, and your going to need fairly beefy
</I>&gt;<i> Asset services with lots of storage space.  Anyway if you have more
</I>&gt;<i> questions about it please let us know.
