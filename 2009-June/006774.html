<PRE>After 2 days of consideration and not hearing anything from the people
that I expected a response from, I came to the conclusion that it is
time to say &quot;Goodbye&quot;

This morning I released the 10 developers that were working on various
projects related to OpenSim and told them that I would see them again
in September for a new project

After all, that's just life ... A project stops and you send people home.


Some household things:


* The OpenSim.Search and OpenSim.Profile projects are being maintained
by Melanie, if she has time for them.

* All other projects that I did are in private mode and can be
released by a Gforge Admin if they need to go public again.


-- This isn't a simple thing for me to do, as I know many of you were
counting on a working Search and Profile.

But look on the bright side, at least now someone else can have a go
at it, make it better and sweeter  --


I am off to get myself a long vacation and after that, maybe I will
decide that OpenSim development is good again.


But I will leave you all with a Chinese Curse someone told me at a meeting once:


&quot;May you live in interesting times&quot;


Until we meet again


Fly Man
