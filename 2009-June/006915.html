<PRE>For &quot;grid mode&quot; things are not as you describe. I can tell you how 
things are done currently, but this may/can change very easily, and in 
fact things are quite different if C is Grider.

For the normal LL client, and as of now: C never talks to G/A/I 
directly; it talks to U and to Rs only. Upon login, C first contacts U, 
which in turn contacts G to know the info about the intended login 
Region, and then it informs that region R about the agent.

On region crossings/TPs G is also not involved that much; it only serves 
for the departing region to find the info about the destination region. 
Once it gets that info, crosssings/TPs are done region-to-region. It's 
also the regions that interact with C during this process. The only 
difference in HG is that G is not used for region lookup at all; instead 
the info about the destination region is local to the departing region. 
But TPs are almost identical, with one extra first step.

You can find some sequence diagrams here:

</I>&gt;<i> on how services connect. If there is a web page that I have overlooked,
</I>&gt;<i> please let me know where it is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here are some assumptions, which may not be right--and I'd like to be
</I>&gt;<i> as accurate as possible. Here are some letters I'll use for servers:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> C - Client
</I>&gt;<i> G - Grid
</I>&gt;<i> U - User
</I>&gt;<i> A - Asset
</I>&gt;<i> I - Inventory
</I>&gt;<i> M - Messaging
</I>&gt;<i> Rx - Region # x
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> .............................
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. For StandAlone mode, C connects with one server that contains all of 
</I>&gt;<i> the other services
</I>&gt;<i>     inside of it, along with N regions. So, this behavior seems more 
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward.
</I>&gt;<i>     All &quot;other services&quot; are (U,A,I,M, and Rx).   I am assuming that 
</I>&gt;<i> most LSL commands
</I>&gt;<i>     are executed server side, except for some like Rotation, Audio and 
</I>&gt;<i> Video Streaming...
</I>&gt;<i>     Is there a list of what is server vs. client side?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. For Grid mode, here are some guesses - please correct or edit..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     C connects to G and then G serves as a gateway, routing messages to 
</I>&gt;<i> the other
</I>&gt;<i>     services. For example, if a user logs in, C connects to G which 
</I>&gt;<i> connects to U,
</I>&gt;<i>     which contains information on all agents and their avatars, 
</I>&gt;<i> positions, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     A and I require the bulk of the database storage since Regions (R) 
</I>&gt;<i> have a UUID
</I>&gt;<i>    (pointer) reference and do not contain the bulk of the data (i.e, 
</I>&gt;<i> textures, images,
</I>&gt;<i>    prim attributes).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     If a region crossing is made from, say R1 to R2, R1 sends a message 
</I>&gt;<i> to G which
</I>&gt;<i>     forwards it to R2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. For HyperGrid mode, there is no &quot;G&quot; and so it is more of a peer to 
</I>&gt;<i> peer relationship
</I>&gt;<i>     of StandAlones.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments and corrections welcome!
