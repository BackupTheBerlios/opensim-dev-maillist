<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I am writing a tutorial for a conference, where I'd like to introduce
them to OpenSim, and I wanted in that tutorial to include some information
on how services connect. If there is a web page that I have overlooked,
please let me know where it is.

Here are some assumptions, which may not be right--and I'd like to be
as accurate as possible. Here are some letters I'll use for servers:

C - Client
G - Grid
U - User
A - Asset
I - Inventory
M - Messaging
Rx - Region # x

.............................

1. For StandAlone mode, C connects with one server that contains all of 
the other services
    inside of it, along with N regions. So, this behavior seems more 
straightforward.
    All &quot;other services&quot; are (U,A,I,M, and Rx).   I am assuming that 
most LSL commands
    are executed server side, except for some like Rotation, Audio and 
Video Streaming...
    Is there a list of what is server vs. client side?

2. For Grid mode, here are some guesses - please correct or edit..

    C connects to G and then G serves as a gateway, routing messages to 
the other
    services. For example, if a user logs in, C connects to G which 
connects to U,
    which contains information on all agents and their avatars, 
positions, etc.

    A and I require the bulk of the database storage since Regions (R) 
have a UUID
   (pointer) reference and do not contain the bulk of the data (i.e, 
textures, images,
   prim attributes).

    If a region crossing is made from, say R1 to R2, R1 sends a message 
to G which
    forwards it to R2.

3. For HyperGrid mode, there is no &quot;G&quot; and so it is more of a peer to 
peer relationship
    of StandAlones.

Comments and corrections welcome!
