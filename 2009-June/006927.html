<PRE>Well i should have been more clear, i guess what i mean is that the goal all
along was to move modules out of core into forge eventually, even the ones
that are already in core. At least that was my understanding and the reason
forge was ultimately created.  So the core is not over bloated with module
work.

</I>&gt;<i> is why I specifically did not include Server/Service modules in the main
</I>&gt;<i> body of my suggestion.  Right now the primary candidates for movement
</I>&gt;<i> would be everything that's within the Optional modules directory.
</I>&gt;<i> Followed by the Replaceable modules directory, then a close examination

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, for those modules that anyone sees as truly not belonging
</I>&gt;<i> in the core, but are currently too highly coupled to move -- then during
</I>&gt;<i> a big refactoring stage IMHO is the ideal time to look at what it would
</I>&gt;<i> take to decouple them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, as I indicated to Melenie -- there is no deadline for
</I>&gt;<i> something like this.  Step 1, put the necessary structure in place --
</I>&gt;<i> patch prebuild and include the appropriate directories in the build --
</I>&gt;<i> to support new third party modules.  Step 2, for those modules that are
</I>&gt;<i> dead easy to include, people with the time on their hands can submit
</I>&gt;<i> patches to create the needed prebuild files and move the code.
