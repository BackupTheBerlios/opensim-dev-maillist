<PRE>Hi Chris,
Thanks for your comments!

Right now my thought was the 4 sim islands. We were going to use a windows
server to run these. Would that be an issue?

I am thinking that your solution is probably best. Does anyone know any cost
effective server hosting companies?

My thought exactly about balancing the users to only have access to a
certain island (or conduct classes that way so that we can balance the load
during classes).

I just want to make sure we can expand as the program grows for the school.
I hate to provide them with this solution and find out we cannot scale up to
their needs in the future.

Does anyone know how I can contact McCortez?

Sadly, I just was running a LAN version in a classroom with 20 kids... It
crashed over and over (0.6.5) and was so slow we could not even get the kids
in. This was a test to see what we could handle in the school with one
server. It scares me to see this situation, and hopefully by getting this
advice I can help these school have this as a distance learning service
within this VW.

My guess is to run a grid. It's easy to make the regions, but again that is
still using 1 server and seems to not like to play nice with me right now.
lol

</I>&gt;<i> Guys,
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all your help on this! I wanted to provide you with the
</I>&gt;<i> information regarding what we are aiming to achieve with the school. I hope
</I>&gt;<i> the info below sheds light on what you guys think would be the best solution
</I>&gt;<i> to my challenge. Let me know what you guys think!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *1. How many users at one time will be logged in at the same time*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the fall semester, we may have up to 3 simultaneous classes of 20
</I>&gt;<i> students, plus teachers and observers, so perhaps up to 70 users.  A few
</I>&gt;<i> additional students not attending a class session may also be logging in at
</I>&gt;<i> the same time to work on assignments etc.  We will try to stagger the class
</I>&gt;<i> schedules to reduce the number of users on the server at any one given time,
</I>&gt;<i> but the 3 class scenario is may happen on occasion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *2. How much material / baggage will each avatar have (10 outfits, 100
</I>&gt;<i> outfits, etc.)*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This will increase over time as we fill out the sim.  Initially I think
</I>&gt;<i> each avatar's inventory will be pretty limited.  Students will need enough
</I>&gt;<i> variety to allow 20 individuals to mix and match outfits pieces to look
</I>&gt;<i> unique (or at least distinguishable ).  Over time we would like to develop
</I>&gt;<i> additional items and outfits that students can earn for completing
</I>&gt;<i> assignments, good grades, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to outfits, students will probably accumulate a certain number
</I>&gt;<i> of items as they complete class activities.  For example, if the class
</I>&gt;<i> activity is to go to the market and collect items on a shopping list, these
</I>&gt;<i> could start to pile up in their inventories.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *3. How many classes will be handled at one given time*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the fall semester, 3 simultaneous classes of 20 students + 1 teacher
</I>&gt;<i> will probably be the max.  This is simply because our teachers will be
</I>&gt;<i> working in shifts and sharing three workstations here in Beijing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *4. How big is the pipeline between the kids home to the server*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is probably going to be some variation here.  Some kids may be
</I>&gt;<i> logging in from well equipped school computer labs for class sessions,
</I>&gt;<i> others may be logging in from home to do an assignment or have a tutoring
</I>&gt;<i> session.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; run 1 sim, I am looking to run multiple sims that will handle the load
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of 800 users. I do not know how to make those sims (not regions I know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; how to make the xml file and make another island) but the server side
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; software connect together on one machine to handle the load. To make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that type of grid, does anyone know where we could actually obtain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; those servers?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim itself includes the executables necessary to create a grid and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have multiple OpenSim instances (each with 1 or more regions) connect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> together.  These are what you would normally call the UGAIM (User Grid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Asset Inventory Messaging) services.  These services will need at least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one server to run on, along with a database server such as MySQL or MSSQL.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You mention 800 students, do you know what kind of concurrency you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need?  If your talking about only 30 to 60 students being live on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grid at a time thats a completely different scenario then having all 800
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on at once.  If you only need 30 to 60, I would suggest 4 to 6 regions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with no more then 2 per OpenSim instance.  This way they can all spread
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out when doing work, and not be crowded.  A properly constructed lecture
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hall at the corners of 4 regions (each hosted on a separate server)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would allow 30 to 60 students to gather to participate in a large event,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while still spreading their concurrent load across multiple regions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Documentation is still pretty light on the entire system, but I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> look at the &quot;Standalone vs Grid&quot; section on this page:
