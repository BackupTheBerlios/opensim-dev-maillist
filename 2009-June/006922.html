Perhaps I wasn't clear, but my intent would be those modules that are 
currently in the main repository would stay in the main repository.  
They would simply be moved to a different folder to make it a bit more 
clear as to separation of core vs core module vs optional module, and to 
make it easier for 3rd part modules to be dropped in.

&gt;<i>  I also dont see how we can start doing something like this during a

</I>Mostly because {guesstimating} 7 out of 10 of the modules are not being 
touched by the refactoring of user, inventory and asset services -- this 
is why I specifically did not include Server/Service modules in the main 
body of my suggestion.  Right now the primary candidates for movement 
would be everything that's within the Optional modules directory.  
Followed by the Replaceable modules directory, then a close examination 
of those modules in the CoreModules directory that if not present do not 
prevent OpenSim from running (I believe Wind, for example, would fall 
under this.)

Additionally, for those modules that anyone sees as truly not belonging 
in the core, but are currently too highly coupled to move -- then during 
a big refactoring stage IMHO is the ideal time to look at what it would 
take to decouple them.

Of course, as I indicated to Melenie -- there is no deadline for 
something like this.  Step 1, put the necessary structure in place -- 
patch prebuild and include the appropriate directories in the build -- 
to support new third party modules.  Step 2, for those modules that are 
dead easy to include, people with the time on their hands can submit 
patches to create the needed prebuild files and move the code.
