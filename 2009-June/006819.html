&gt;<i> Hello,

</I>&gt;<i> a patch that has a cautionary note and also sports an exception

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I don't know what are you talking about, my patch doesn't cause those things.
Exception is thrown on my PC by not modified trunk code (code as it is
in the repository)
when OpenSim server starts, but 0.6.5-post-fixes code runs well on my PC
so there must be sth wrong with the trunk code. That's why I don't
work on trunk code.

&gt;<i> Also, please do NOT submit patches for post-fixes, any patches that
</I>&gt;<i> you want to have any chance of going in have to be against trunk always.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Over a week ago I made a version of my patch for the trunk, but nobody
cared to check it out.
And as I wrote in my previous email, if anybody is interested I will
make updated version of my
patch for the current revision of the trunk.

&gt;<i> Please make a version against trunk that either has no database
</I>&gt;<i> changes at all, or implements all changes against both SQLite and
</I>&gt;<i> MySQL. That is mandatory for your patch to be considered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>My patch doesn't touches database code. There are only comments in
SQLiteRegionData.cs - I would like somebody to explain me why OpenSim
behaves that way. But again there are only comments, you can ignore this file.

&gt;<i> Please ensure it's tested thoroughly, so it won't eat anyone's babies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>All tests pass on trunk code, with one change in one test in
BasicRegionTest.cs, I made this change because this test is badly written
in my opinion.
Besides, my code works correctly in OpenSim server (0.6.5-post-fixes)
and in a viewer.

&gt;<i> Also, a presence in IRC can halp your case, as you can talk to
</I>&gt;<i> committers there and get the reservations cleared up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Why should I hang out on IRC if nobody cares about my patches.

&gt;<i> Melanie
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thanks for your answer,
robert_d
