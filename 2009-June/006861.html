<PRE>Hi Guys,

I was using the opensim today with 25 students on a local network and it
seems as if the server side software could not even handle 25 users. I am
very concerned about this as I would like to scale this up to around 800
users and build my own grid for this high school I am helping. However, it
seems as if the stability of the software cannot handle that large of load
(obviously) so is there a way to balance those loads between multiple
servers, and if so can you run the server side software multiple times on
the same windows machine and link them together? Just curious what you guys
think can be a solution to this issue. The school has expressed that they
want this to be stand along on their own servers (they have not bought the
servers yet. Any ideas on how we can make this happen? Thanks!
