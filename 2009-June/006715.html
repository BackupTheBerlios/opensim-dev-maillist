<PRE>How about you check out the subversion tree at the last revision
without the &quot;whole mess that it is now&quot;?  That's what revision control
systems are for, so you can check out old revisions.  You can control
your own experience -- while everyone else can cooperate as they want
to.

You should do this instead of bitching on the mailing list and
essentially saying &quot;IT'S MY BALL AND I'M GOING HOME&quot;.

You're thus making a huge deal out of, literally, nothing.  Which
means you're a drama whore at best, and a troll at worst.

Get a grip.  I will also point out that the main OpenSim project trunk
isn't clean, and that branches are made to maintain specific
milestones, and so your objection to &quot;as long as the main trunk is
clean&quot; isn't even in line with what the community has (loosely)
standardized on.  Yes, this might fly in the face of other projects'
conventions, but this is what we have to deal with and have to live
with as a part of working with OpenSim.

&gt;<i> Ideia, this problem can easily be resolved by 2 people that just say
</I>&gt;<i> sorry and revert back the things that they added to the OpenSimWiredux
</I>&gt;<i> so I can take a clean copy of the code without the whole mess that it
</I>&gt;<i> is now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, in other words as some won't know what I said on #opensim-dev:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jamenai: Please send me an email, explaining why you added things to
</I>&gt;<i> the Wiredux, stating that you didn't contact me before adding this and
</I>&gt;<i> that you will revert the source back to the rev that I added. It's
</I>&gt;<i> okay with me to make a new branch where you fiddle with all your stuff
</I>&gt;<i> as long as the main trunk is clean
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nebadon: Please send me an email, telling me that you were wrong to
</I>&gt;<i> think that I left the scene just because of the Money Debacle. And
</I>&gt;<i> that you did know about me being in a small holiday until the 1st of
</I>&gt;<i> June as mentioned in several announcements that I did on all the IRC
</I>&gt;<i> channels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When those 2 people have made their excuses, I will no longer have a
</I>&gt;<i> need to ask for deletion of the projects and will be a happy camper
</I>&gt;<i> once again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not in my natural nature to be like this, but for some people
</I>&gt;<i> this might sound like nagging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, it's not nagging, it's getting right what is wrong at this moment.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do not know who is right in your disagreement, but I think if you had
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something you were thinking that was not being done in the most correct, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think the only way would have launched the discussion on mail-list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> #opensim-dev and not just you away from everything and remove the work you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> did, the work of all is very important and only a small opinion can make a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> See that I am not defending anyone, I'm only making an observation of what I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> read in a mail-list
