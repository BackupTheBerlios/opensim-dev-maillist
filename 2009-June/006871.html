<PRE>Well, let me jump in here a little bit.

If I were going to set this up, I would start with four OpenSim regions, each running on a different Linux server.

I would put them in a square and make the landing point at the four-corner junction. 

I would then make each of the four regions a seperate classroom and plan on reliably handling 20-30 simultaneous in each of the four regions.

When I had sufficient experience, i.e. one quarter (or semester), then I would consider expanding (or coalescing two regions into one server) based on the quarter's (or semester's) reliability or stability.

I think MCortez said something very similar to this a few posts ago and he would tend to know also.

Charles

p.s. At this point, one can expect to handle 20 avatars simultaneously in one region comfortably.

p.p.s 40 Avatars simultaneous in one region is 'iffy'.

p.p.p.s One can have as many regions as one has servers to serve them from.

p.p.p.p.s I would probably run a grid and allow this grid to connect regions rather then running a number of standalones.

Guys,

Thanks for all your help on this! I wanted to provide you with the information regarding what we are aiming to achieve with the school. I hope the info below sheds light on what you guys think would be the best solution to my challenge. Let me know what you guys think!




1. How many users at one time will be logged in at the same time

For the fall semester, we may have up to 3 simultaneous classes of 20 students, plus teachers and observers, so perhaps up to 70 users.  A few additional students not attending a class session may also be logging in at the same time to work on assignments etc.  We will try to stagger the class schedules to reduce the number of users on the server at any one given time, but the 3 class scenario is may happen on occasion.


2. How much material / baggage will each avatar have (10 outfits, 100 outfits, etc.)

This will increase over time as we fill out the sim.  Initially I think each avatar's inventory will be pretty limited.  Students will need enough variety to allow 20 individuals to mix and match outfits pieces to look unique (or at least distinguishable ).  Over time we would like to develop additional items and outfits that students can earn for completing assignments, good grades, etc.

In addition to outfits, students will probably accumulate a certain number of items as they complete class activities.  For example, if the class activity is to go to the market and collect items on a shopping list, these could start to pile up in their inventories.


3. How many classes will be handled at one given time

For the fall semester, 3 simultaneous classes of 20 students + 1 teacher will probably be the max.  This is simply because our teachers will be working in shifts and sharing three workstations here in Beijing.


4. How big is the pipeline between the kids home to the server
There is probably going to be some variation here.  Some kids may be logging in from well equipped school computer labs for class sessions, others may be logging in from home to do an assignment or have a tutoring session.

</I>OpenSim itself includes the executables necessary to create a grid and
have multiple OpenSim instances (each with 1 or more regions) connect
together.  These are what you would normally call the UGAIM (User Grid
Asset Inventory Messaging) services.  These services will need at least
one server to run on, along with a database server such as MySQL or MSSQL.

You mention 800 students, do you know what kind of concurrency you
need?  If your talking about only 30 to 60 students being live on the
grid at a time thats a completely different scenario then having all 800
on at once.  If you only need 30 to 60, I would suggest 4 to 6 regions
with no more then 2 per OpenSim instance.  This way they can all spread
out when doing work, and not be crowded.  A properly constructed lecture
hall at the corners of 4 regions (each hosted on a separate server)
would allow 30 to 60 students to gather to participate in a large event,
while still spreading their concurrent load across multiple regions.

Documentation is still pretty light on the entire system, but I would
look at the &quot;Standalone vs Grid&quot; section on this page:
