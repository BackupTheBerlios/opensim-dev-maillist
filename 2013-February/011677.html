<PRE>Hi,

It looks like OpenSim doesn't tell the viewer which maturity ratings a user
is allowed to use. I'm using the latest Firestorm, and in the Avatar
Preferences dialog I try to change the value of the listbox &quot;I want to
access content rated&quot; from General to Moderate or Adult, but Firestorm says
that I'm not allowed. So the viewer thinks my user is only allowed to access
General content.

I searched, but I couldn't find how the viewer is told the user's maturity
rating. Does anyone know? Is it a UDP packet that we haven't implemented
yet, or an HTTP request to Second Life? If the latter then we'll need to ask
Armin Weatherwax to allow that request to be redirected to an arbitrary URL
so that we can handle it in OpenSim.

The problem with having the user stuck on General maturity level is that
sounds that originate in a region with Moderate or Adult maturity rating
aren't played. (They did play in Imprudence, but they don't play in new
viewers.)

Oren
