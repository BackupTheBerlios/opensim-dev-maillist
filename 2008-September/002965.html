<PRE>Ok, not opening up for discussion, just telling you what I've known to pragmatically work in microsoft c# projects;
 
* The assembly name _is_ the directory name (not a subtree)
 
So, you have the OpenSim.Framework.Communications dir and the OpenSim.Framework.Console as directories alongside each others
 
* The test assembly is called &quot;*.Tests&quot; and is placed in the same directory as the tested assembly
this means that a listing of that dir would look like this:
 
OpenSim.Framework.Communications/
OpenSim.Framework.Communications.Tests/
OpenSim.Framework.Console/
OpenSim.Framework.Console.Tests/
and, incidentally, this is replicated in the solutions explorer.
 
which is what I mean with 'keeping them together'. Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A>

Why force the production DLLs to larger&gt; &gt;&gt; sizes when those tests are never run against the same compiled&gt; &gt;&gt; assembly more than once? Also when packaging OpenSim, the test DLLs&gt; &gt;&gt; can be removed, saving a little on space.&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -1 on combining code and its tests in one assembly.&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i think having a.b.c.test and having test and code in different assemblies is&gt; &gt; not contradictory...&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with Melanie et al that having test code + dependencies in the &gt; production level-executables is not desirable. The production &gt; executables should be lean and clean.&gt; &gt; But, debug level executables and DLLs is a different story. I agree with &gt; those voices that having code and test cases for that code spread around &gt; in large number of directory structures and (often ad hoc, confusing and &gt; inconsistent) naming conventions, with large number of DLLs is not &gt; helpful for debugging and testing purposes. If I have a given DLL how I &gt; should know which DLL to call to test that one in question? For a given &gt; test code how I know what code it is actually being tested? And for the &gt; code, how I know if there are test cases for it already or not? Even &gt; though there is not much being tested in OS now, it is already confusing &gt; to know of what exactly is being tested, where the tests are, and which &gt; DLLs those tests are going to be compiled into.&gt; &gt; The two objectives above are not exclusive - they can be achieved &gt; together. This is exactly what compile-time flags are for. This is why &gt; GCC has a -d flag, etc. The build process should produce clean &gt; execulables and DLLs for production releases, and debug executables and &gt; DLLs for everything else.&gt; &gt; I would rather see test code being together with the code that is being &gt; tested, and I would rather see test binary code going into the DLL that &gt; is being tested too. There are some cases where a single test case spans &gt; multiple codebases, but these are usually exceptions, and could go to a &gt; single project-wide DLL with all the awkward tests - a DLL that is well &gt; known to everyone.&gt; &gt; Otherwise, too much freedom will create more problems than necessary. &gt; Simple question like: &quot;where is the test code for this particular code &gt; I'm looking at right now, and how I can run it&quot; will become non-trivial.&gt; &gt; &gt; -- &gt; cheers&gt; Mariusz&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
