<PRE>I've also noticed the limited utility of the OS terrain editing tools 
relative to SL. I do a fair amount of multi-sim terraforming on both 
platforms (SL: Shengri La; OS: Arizona Bay in osgrid, Tardis before smooth 
tool, and several other smallers stunts) I contributed code an early 
smooth tool, before the last round of terrain tool reworkings. 

A few observations:

        - OS large brush terrain ops are much faster than SL, which is a 
good thing when you are doing very large terraforming operations.

        - As Melanie mentioned, the smaller brushes are ineffectual. Small 
has no noticable effect, and medium could be a little larger if small was 
useful

        -Flatten in SL remembers the height of the original click for the 
duration of the hold, and brings the land to that height, which is great 
forming trails at the same height so they reflect the land textures 
applied to the terrain. In OS, the flatten tool has a moving target that 
appently attempts to flatten the land around the average height. There are 
use cases for both, it would be nice to have the option.

        -Occaisionally I see a mode that forms the terrain spikes. It is 
unfortunately not always reproducible, which is puzzling. For a few 
versions it was consistant and bad, and reminded me of the bug I saw 
(missing minus sign on the transform ;-p ) when getting the first smooth 
tool to work. Currently it happens sometimes, but is repairable with 
flatten. If I can nail a reproducible case, I'll mantis it.

        -At some point multisim regions in standalone mode had a problem 
with spikes forming, and a horrible flatten bug when the brush crossed 
sims (catastrophically flattening the crossed sim to the default 
height...a bug which took out a quarter of a four sim mountain on 
Tardis...ugh) The flatten bug has been resolved but recent touches to 
tardis gave spikes.

        - OS: Flattening and smoothing does not work on sim boundaries, 
though persistant trickery can cover up the problem for emergency 
terraforming. Smoothing across sim boundaries on a slope induces a cliff 
along the border. The convergence of the op appears to give cliff height 
that is somewhat related to the slope of the terrain under smoothing 
(something like a few meters for a 45 degree slope, Higher cliff for 
steeper slope.) Flatten does not fix the cliff, it mostly reinforces it. 
They way around it involves crafty combinations of raise with dashes of 
flatten and smooth...clearly not optimal.

Finally, I'll through a big +N at using the terrain tools inworld where 
possible. A clear advantage is that fine adjustments can take place in the 
context of the build and landscaping, and evolve with it. Sunsets and 
sunrises can be crafted from favorite sitting spots, and more generally, 
form can better follow function. Consider Shengri La in SL as an example. 

...my two cents

-Mike Pitman/Rez Tone

I did say &quot;Wysiwyg&quot;.
L3DT is not. It's algorithm-based.
It's also not 100% linux compatible
There is not tool I know of that you can use to terraform like in SL, 
e.g. with a mobile camera and brushes.
