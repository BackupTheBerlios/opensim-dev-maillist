</I>The reason why not many people are doing it, it's because it's not 
documented anywhere! :-)  Which I totally understand; there's no point 
in documenting an API that's still unstable. Once things stabilize a 
little bit more (i.e. closer to 1.0), I'll write down a few tutorials on 
how to develop applications with OpenSim.

Scripting is great because it's easily graspable by the masses; 
scripting shouldn't go away, and it should get even easier. But for 
serious applications, geez... forget scripting! Certain things cannot be 
done with the object model exposed to scripts, which is solidly grounded 
on the real world metaphor (that's the reason why it's so easy to 
grasp). The architecture/API you guys have developed, plus or minus a 
few things, is definitely the way to go. It's what I (for one) was 
expecting/hoping it to be.

But keep in mind that all of these goodies still have a big obstacle in 
front known as &quot;the grid&quot; and its &quot;users.&quot; Those concepts need to be 
broken down to their pieces. What's the point of developing interesting 
applications if no one can come and see them unless I choose one, and 
only one, &quot;grid&quot; to connect my regions to? That's just silly. My regions 
are online; people should just be able to browse through them without 
having to register and without me having to store their user-ness, 
inventory, etc.

So -- that's my humble wish for 0.7+: get rid of &quot;grids&quot; as we know them.
