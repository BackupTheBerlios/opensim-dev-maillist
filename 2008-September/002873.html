The issue we are currently running in to is that no one is really
touching DNE, so we effectively only have 1 engine getting developed and
a lot of energy trying to filter out common parts with an engine that is
stagnant.

It seems like on the road to getting 1 solid engine we'd be better off
getting 1 to work first for most cases, then let others come in as
needed.  We did that with physics, where nearly all the effort went into
ODE, then over time the meshers for ODE were factored out (for
maintainability and sharability) and a lot of that code is usable by
other engines.

Unless someone in core really wants to step it up on Dot Net Engine, I'd
suggest we are much better served by making XEngine our default and
addressing any issues that people have in different runtime situations
in that engine.
