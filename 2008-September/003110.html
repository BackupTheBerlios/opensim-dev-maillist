</I>Especially in the case of OSGrid, please read the instructions at
<A HREF="http://osgrid.org/index.php?&amp;page=smodul&amp;id=15&amp;btn=7&amp;subbtn=15">http://osgrid.org/index.php?&amp;page=smodul&amp;id=15&amp;btn=7&amp;subbtn=15</A>
&quot;... Second be aware that when you shut your region down it is purged
from the database and your position will become available for anyone
who wishes to take it, so please note that if your region is shut down
properly that the square you populate is fair game, we will however do
our best to settle region location disputes but it is not our
responsibility to ensure you keep your location. And lastly regions
that do not respond for more than 24 hours are at risk of being purged
by an admin, consideration will be given for special cases but there
are no gaurnetees that repeat offenders will continue to be given
consideration, It is your responsibility to keep your regions running
and updated not the responsibility of OSGrid or any of its volunteer
staff. ...&quot;
So, according to those rules, I'd say: If you want to keep your
location, you'll have to keep your region running.

Cheers,
  Homer
