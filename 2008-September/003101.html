<PRE>Hi,

OpenSim is very much a work in progress. This current stab at 
permissions doeen't even attempt to address this issue in the depth 
that you have explored it to.

It was meant to be a simple true/false, then I incorporated the 
suggestion for a UUID list for privileged users.

This is not about ACLs or scripting rights levels (yet), but just 
about a meant of allowing beneficial os* functions while blocking 
potentially harmful ones.

One grid may see the griefing danger of letting any object animate 
any avatar without a permission being granted.
Another grid may need this feature desperately.

Just deciding which functions would be available and which aren't 
would be very divisive. So I created a common sense base based on 
grids like OSGrid, and then created a system by which it can be 
overridden outside of code.

For the moment, not more is needed. A real ACL system has been 
thought about, but it's nowhere near writing the first line of code.

</I>&gt;<i> without all sorts of subsystem-interaction testing leads to nothing
</I>&gt;<i> but epic failure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A case in point: I work with a C language interactive MUD software
</I>&gt;<i> called 'fbmuck'.  This software has the property that everything
</I>&gt;<i> addressable by the software has one and only one owner... but has
</I>&gt;<i> three separate subsystems which deal with permissions to act on
</I>&gt;<i> different objects -- which grew out of three separate attempts to
</I>&gt;<i> extend the capabilities of the system, at different times in the
</I>&gt;<i> development of security consciousness.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first was the command line.
</I>&gt;<i> The second was a programming language (based on Forth). (MUF)
</I>&gt;<i> The third was another programming language which is embedded in
</I>&gt;<i> printable strings, parsed and substituted at display time. (MPI)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first was the most limited as to what it could do.  The second was
</I>&gt;<i> retrofitted and could do things that the command line couldn't even
</I>&gt;<i> hope to do.  During its retrofit and development it was honed and
</I>&gt;<i> modified so that certain circumstances could extend or restrict what
</I>&gt;<i> it could do in any given invocation.  (This included, in order of
</I>&gt;<i> development: Creation of &quot;Wizard&quot; powers, Separation of &quot;Wizard&quot; from
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Mucker&quot;, further striation of &quot;Mucker&quot; into 3 privilege levels,
</I>&gt;<i> restriction of what parts of MUD-level objects each Mucker level could
</I>&gt;<i> affect and how, the creation of new primitive functions that couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> fit well into the three-plus-one layer striation, and the creation of
</I>&gt;<i> a list of &quot;these functions are too dangerous&quot; functions which could be
</I>&gt;<i> blocked at compile-time.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The third was developed over ten years later, when one of the
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces to the MUF programming language was found to be extremely
</I>&gt;<i> abusive of CPU power and cycles.  Until this point, if someone wanted
</I>&gt;<i> to programmatically and automatically alter their descriptions
</I>&gt;<i> (remember, this is text-based) based on a small set of variables, they
</I>&gt;<i> had to invoke a specific program from their description property.
</I>&gt;<i> Quite simply, the burden of starting up an interpreter instance was so
</I>&gt;<i> prohibitive, it became necessary to create something that could be
</I>&gt;<i> simply embedded, and be able to be parsed by the MUD software much
</I>&gt;<i> more efficiently.  The designer of this language created it to be
</I>&gt;<i> aware of the security of the MUF language, and put a lot of thought
</I>&gt;<i> into making it work within the strictures without granting additional
</I>&gt;<i> privileges.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This worked wonderfully -- until it was found that there was a way to
</I>&gt;<i> code using the third language that could write to a property that was
</I>&gt;<i> prohibited to the second language, and thus caused the third language
</I>&gt;<i> to later interpret that string in a different security context than
</I>&gt;<i> the one it originated in, and created the means for a virus to be
</I>&gt;<i> written.  (It was the first known virtual-world
</I>&gt;<i> association-transmitted disease -- if you looked at someone whose
</I>&gt;<i> description was infected, your description became infected.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would have been prevented if there had been a single point of
</I>&gt;<i> failure, a single point where authorization to perform any action
</I>&gt;<i> would pass or fail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, the point of my long-winded rambling is this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you're going to develop something like AllowScriptFunction(), could
</I>&gt;<i> you please please please factor it out of the scripting engine,
</I>&gt;<i> genericize it (based on what operation is being attempted by what
</I>&gt;<i> script owned by who and run in what security context against what
</I>&gt;<i> other object owned by what person and probably a hundred other things
</I>&gt;<i> that I'm not thinking of right now), put it in the security management
</I>&gt;<i> framework, and make everything that can manipulate other things call
</I>&gt;<i> it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I only ask/suggest this because I know how difficult it is to change
</I>&gt;<i> something in a code base once it's entrenched.  I've been fighting (in
</I>&gt;<i> fbmuck) to separate out what privileges are needed for various
</I>&gt;<i> primitive functions, and it's possible that it's too tangled a mess to
</I>&gt;<i> ever separate without sacrificing backward-compatibility.  I think
</I>&gt;<i> that exploits against OpenSim's ownership model -- in any form --
</I>&gt;<i> would be the worst possible condition.
