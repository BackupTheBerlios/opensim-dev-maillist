That was exactly my circumstances when I first raised this. I was 
using a 13 region area (all on a single server) in standalone mode 
when I got the high spike on each moused over cell. A gentle single 
click touch and the area rocketed up perhaps 100m with sheer 
sides.  I was using &quot;raise land&quot; with &quot;small&quot; set using a recent 
trunk binary build version (around 7-Sep-2008) . I was NOT near a sim 
boundary.  It really means its too dangerous at present to risk 
smoothing out the land.  I was just trying to fill in a puddle and 
ended up with 20 minutes work to recover the system.

I do know this used to happen about a year ago.. but then it settled 
down and we had no problem doing minor terraforming adjustments, even 
though the operations were a bit slow, and it took the sim system 
time to catch up.

Could it be all the latest terrain tool changes have broken this again?

Some in-world adjustment is need even when mostly using terrain files 
for the core design.. since you want to make flat bases for building 
areas, etc.  So the in world tools do need to work reasonably.
