<PRE>Hi Shack,

Great work! Other people will certainly fix the problem soon, but I'd 
like to make a suggestion.
There's no need to use  bot-based hacks in OpenSim, since the backend is 
all open. Also, there are no annoying limitations on the size of prims, etc.
You can rewrite your tool without libomv, using OpenSim's region 
modules. It will be 1000% easier to maintain (for you) and to use (for 
your users).

Ideally, one would simply want the XML description of those objects, 
really. So make your tool spit out OpenSim's XML, and write a module for 
importing the textures.

Is your tool open-sourced?

</I>&gt;<i> This week I started using OpenSim's tags/0.5.9-released branch in SVN.

</I>&gt;<i> so far has been in standalone mode, basicphysics, and SQLite
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 0.5.8 seemed rock solid.  It took just about anything I could throw at 
</I>&gt;<i> it.  Sometimes, I had to slow things down for it, but it worked 
</I>&gt;<i> predictably.  0.5.9 seems less solid and in particular, I'm encountering 
</I>&gt;<i> huge problems with linking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've created a series of data sets with 100, 200, and 400 prims.  And 
</I>&gt;<i> also different amounts of linking, from no linking to 100 prim 
</I>&gt;<i> linksets.  The naming convention is &quot;link_x_boxes_y&quot; which indicates 
</I>&gt;<i> that it contains y boxes that are linked into x linksets.  So, 
</I>&gt;<i> link_10_boxes_100 means that there are 100 prims that have been linked 
</I>&gt;<i> into 10 linksets of 10 prims each.  link_2_boxes_100 means 100 prims in 
</I>&gt;<i> 2 linksets of 50 prims each.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I started seeing problems immediately in 0.5.9.  link_2_boxes_4 should 
</I>&gt;<i> produce 4 prims that are linked into two pairs of 2.  And it did this in 
</I>&gt;<i> 0.5.8.  But in 0.5.9, it produced 3 prims that were linked together with 
</I>&gt;<i> a 4th prim that was unlinked and out of position.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Larger linksets do even crazier things.  Linksets with 50 prims or more 
</I>&gt;<i> will spontaneously link to other prims in the sim that were never 
</I>&gt;<i> specified in the link request.  And I'm seeing duplicate prims that get 
</I>&gt;<i> linked in strange ways.  Some of the duplicates get their position set 
</I>&gt;<i> to half a sim away from where the originals were created.  It is bizarre.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would probably think that I'd done something wrong, except that the 
</I>&gt;<i> same program works perfectly when run against 0.5.8.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seems like there is a multi-threading issue or something similar going 
</I>&gt;<i> on that is causing things to go haywire inside of OpenSim 0.5.9 when 
</I>&gt;<i> linking is done.  It's probably a small bug, but it is doing serious damage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, here's the thing.  I have more information that I can provide.  I've 
</I>&gt;<i> made a lot of observations.  I'd be glad to give you a compiled copy of 
</I>&gt;<i> the program I'm using and the data I use to perform the tests.  Just let 
</I>&gt;<i> me know what you'd like.
