</I>Dahlia,

Thanks for sharing your experience.  It gave me the boost I needed.

It looks like I've been seeing a combination of things, but one thing 
that definitely happened is that the OpenSim db got corrupted at some 
point along the way.  A lot of the weirdness was probably because of that. 

After I rested a bit, I started doing some testing with the client and 
it was behaving very strangely, too.  Prims were rezzing in odd ways.  
For example, I rezzed about 50 prims by hand and when I selected them, 
it told me that I had 50 objects selected and 46 prims.  Very strange.  
After I blew away the database and started over, things returned to normal.

Also, with my big linksets of 100 prims, I had to increase 
Settings.SIMULATOR_TIMEOUT in libomv.  OpenSim was getting disk IO bound 
at certain times and thus not responding to the client for periods of 
time greater than 30 seconds.  libomv was timing out and terminating the 
connection.

Anyway, at least I'm making some progress now.  Thanks!
