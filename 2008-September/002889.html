<PRE>Alan,
 
I was not referring to the OpenSim binary, but binary distributions based on OpenSim, like Tribal Net, for example. OpenSim is not only used as an application, but is also used as a platform and API for other applications. Also, OpenSim binaries are being used in production and pushed onto production servers.
 
For those cases, they would have to strip that test code out manually on every update, which would suck. Keeping assembly dependencies down to a bare minimum is good practice. Not bloating code unnecessarily is good practice.
 
Of course we all want testing. Pragmatic testing that moves the project forward. We definitively have regressions with almost every version. That sucks.
 
But I see no reason not to discuss and find a way to organize those tests we all want written in a good and productive manner, just because there at the moment aren't that many of them.
I actually at one time advocated having code and tests in the same assemblies in a TDD project I was the coach on. It turned out to be a bad idea for when deployment came.

Which raises the question: Do we have a &quot;distribution&quot; in the sense of a consistently formed binary distribution that is distinct from the development tree? Where test cases go should might their nature: we should have (eventually anyway) unit, functional, compliance, regression, performance, and system tests. Others? Personally, I don't think *where* the test case source goes makes much difference to anything, both approaches have merits. +1 to binaries WITOUT tests included +1 to binaries WITH tests included. +1 to tests kept with the code to which they relate +1 to tests kept in a separate testing subtree. But most of all: +1 to tests AND +2 to using them. Best regardsAlan-------------------T.J.

Not to mention the additional and superfluous refernces to the test framework. You do not want those to be part of your distribution.-1 on merging them, +1 on keeping them close to each others.Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media ABJoin the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A>

Why force the production DLLs to larger&gt; sizes when those tests are never run against the same compiled&gt; assembly more than once? Also when packaging OpenSim, the test DLLs&gt; can be removed, saving a little on space.&gt; &gt; -1 on combining code and its tests in one assembly.&gt; &gt; Mike&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev_______________________________________________Opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev_______________________________________________Opensim-dev</A> mailing <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">listOpensim-dev at lists.berlios.dehttps</A>://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev
