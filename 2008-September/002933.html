<PRE>The recent commit that removed a lot of ScriptSleep calls that were 
already commented prompted me to look at which ones are even still 
in there.
I found that in LSL_BuiltInCommands, most of them are commented, and 
many commented ones have been removed.

The ScriptSleep and it's associated factors had been introduced for 
the reason that we would be able to retain LSL (SL) compatibility 
where desired, yet override the delays where that is wanted.

Removal of the sleep calls, or commenting them, is not really in the 
spirit of that consensus that was found.

Why, even though the factors are there to reduce or completely 
eliminate the delays, are the delay calls being removed?

We should strive to insert, not remove, them, to achieve 100% 
compatibility for those who want it.
Especially the all important 20 second delay on llSendEmail has been 
commented at some point, even though many existing scripts will 
break in horrible ways if that delay isn't there. The 
llInstantMessage delay is of equal importance, since for both these 
functions, it is customary to build dispatchers in LSL, which depend 
on the delay to function correctly.

Have we now officially abandoned the plan of providing at least the 
option of source code copy/paste compatibility?

Melanie
