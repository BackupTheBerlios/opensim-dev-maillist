<PRE>Dahlia,

Content creation work flows are certainly quite ad hoc. This is true in
general, as well as for SL.

But, is it possible that some of the tools will become platforms in their
own right? To see what I mean, look at how SketchUp and 3Dwarehouse.com are
evolving and how they are being hooked up with Google Earth or could be
hooked up to Lively. Also, look at a tool like Truespace. If you can get
past it's 90 degree learning curve, you'll see that there is already a
virtual experience creation platform, with a complete API and javascript
support, hiding in there.

I think one of the things that set SL apart was the appeal of in world
content creation. Yes, doing something that meets all the needs of the
advanced designer is out of scope. But what about something to attract the
SketchUp crowd? Is that worth pursuing?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also like to think about the &quot;content creator&quot; role and how it differs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the &quot;developer&quot; role. The &quot;content creator&quot; uses powerful in-world
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> building tools to create stuff. The &quot;developer&quot; would extend the tools
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available to &quot;content creator&quot; by adding external modules to the region.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many (if not most) SL content creators, including myself, rely upon outside
</I>&gt;<i> tools to accomplish their work. Photoshop or another image editor are very
</I>&gt;<i> common as SL provides no in-world editing tools. There are specialized
</I>&gt;<i> applications for creating clothing for SL avatars, and some content, such as
</I>&gt;<i> sculpties and animations, are created exclusively outside SL, Many scripts
</I>&gt;<i> serve as only an interface between the  SL world and the outside computers
</I>&gt;<i> running code which could be far more complex than the simple scripting model
</I>&gt;<i> could otherwise support. I think what is being proposed here may already
</I>&gt;<i> exist and was probably considered by the Linden developers, but the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation was quite crude and restrictive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One advantage to having in-world tools available is it encourages everyone
</I>&gt;<i> to try to create content and this has helped lead to wider acceptance and
</I>&gt;<i> popularity of SL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I'd love to see more examples of using Opensim's APIs as a more
</I>&gt;<i> advanced way of developing special applications :D
