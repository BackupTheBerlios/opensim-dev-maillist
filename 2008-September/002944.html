<PRE>Stefan, that stuff is really cool. Very much like what I've been imagining.
Thanks for pointing me to it!

</I>&gt;<i> and definitively; as I was trying to convey, we at Tribal have, since

</I>&gt;<i> implemented some time ago - including a web api that would not only
</I>&gt;<i> externalize interactivity, but also delegate the very creation of the
</I>&gt;<i> in-world content to web services. Especially note the web pane that is used
</I>&gt;<i> to interact 'around' objects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Diva just showed us a couple of screen shots where she's doing the very
</I>&gt;<i> thing you propose, but from an app point, not from an generic object point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe these things are as far into the future as you might

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I've also been thinking about things like global scripts and external
</I>&gt;<i> script servers. External script servers would solve some of the script state
</I>&gt;<i> serialization issues. Instead of moving a running script from one region to
</I>&gt;<i> another, it just keeps running on it's server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But what got me excited recently was the realization that we may not need
</I>&gt;<i> new client functionality to add in world building features. Would something
</I>&gt;<i> like the following work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most clients have an embedded web browser. The server can request that the
</I>&gt;<i> client open the browser on a specific URL, right? that means the server can
</I>&gt;<i> provide it's own UI for things, it isn't limited to just the UI the client
</I>&gt;<i> has implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, the server could show a tree of hierarchically linked prims
</I>&gt;<i> and other objects. When you select one, you can see and change properties on
</I>&gt;<i> that object that the client doesn't know about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The server can also use tricks like locking and unlocking prims and
</I>&gt;<i> generating &quot;bounding box&quot; prims around grouped objects, allowing them to be
</I>&gt;<i> scaled, rotated, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Granted it isn't perfect. Keeping the browser state and the viewer state in
</I>&gt;<i> sync will be a challenge. But it is a starting point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If done right, the extended backend functionally would be expected as
</I>&gt;<i> services that a client could call. That way you can start without any new
</I>&gt;<i> client features, but the clients can add better features over time.

</I>&gt;<i> At the moment, it seems we have two main strands of developers; the
</I>&gt;<i> 'scripters' and the 'appers' - those using the in-world (SL-based)
</I>&gt;<i> programming model and the ones using the module API's to create region-wide
</I>&gt;<i> and integrations behaviours.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, there's several ideas of where to take OpenSim behaviour
</I>&gt;<i> customization, but so far, we haven't discussed it much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although, the scripting engine model allows us to use an array of languages
</I>&gt;<i> for scripting, and several of them probably gives you the option to do those
</I>&gt;<i> things you list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess the big revolution comes the day we drop our SL-client-centric view
</I>&gt;<i> of building and scripting, and begin to see external tools to compose
</I>&gt;<i> behaviours and content, where you can add contextual points that simply
</I>&gt;<i> aren't there in the SL viewer today. As, for example, region-wide global
</I>&gt;<i> scripts and libraries - there simply aren't anywhere to place those in th
</I>&gt;<i> SL-centric model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We at Tribal have been toying with a multitude of ways to get round this
</I>&gt;<i> (like having region nodes in the inventory, with objects that are local to
</I>&gt;<i> the region) so there's definitively room for invention and experimentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing I would like to see somebody do, is to have prim scripts being
</I>&gt;<i> compiled into a c# assembly; ie, something along the line that all scripts
</I>&gt;<i> that are referenced from within a prim becomes a compiled whole, which would
</I>&gt;<i> let scripts reference resources in other scripts - and as mentioned, in
</I>&gt;<i> library nodes. If the actual Prim would be compiled into a referencable
</I>&gt;<i> (probably marshalled) entity too, that would open truly amazing
</I>&gt;<i> opportunities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another interesting Tedd concept that's unfortunately haven't been worked
</I>&gt;<i> on is the scriptserver, where behaviours are collected and externalized to a
</I>&gt;<i> central process that could govern several objects in several region
</I>&gt;<i> processes.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Thanks Crista.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think there are two separate application models at work here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What you describe is the API for extending the OpenSim itself. I'm sure
</I>&gt;<i> I'll have fun experimenting with it in the coming weeks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, what I'm trying to understand are the kinds of features that make
</I>&gt;<i> creating large and complex things in world easier. Usually you don't think
</I>&gt;<i> of building and scripting in world as creating an application, but isn't
</I>&gt;<i> that pretty much what it is? At least I find that thinking of it in those
</I>&gt;<i> terms helps me start think about how to make the task of building complex
</I>&gt;<i> things easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, it should be possible to link a set of prims, duplicate that
</I>&gt;<i> set many times, and then make a change to a prim in the set and have that
</I>&gt;<i> change replicated, automatically, to all the duplicates. Similarly, it
</I>&gt;<i> should be possible to create a library of script functions that can be
</I>&gt;<i> used by many scripts, without manually duplicating the script code over and
</I>&gt;<i> over. You can think of these things as part of an app model that supports
</I>&gt;<i> reusable components, something analogous to an assembly. Now you can start
</I>&gt;<i> thinking about how you would &quot;reference&quot; such a component for your build or
</I>&gt;<i> how you would distribute an updated version of the component.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to know how others thought about the current &quot;in world&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> application model and how it might be evolved. Is any work going on in that
</I>&gt;<i> area?

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim has a rudimentary application model, or even two: the one I'm most
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with are the region modules, and I think there's another module
</I>&gt;<i> system. They allow you to develop applications for the OpenSim API.
</I>&gt;<i> Developing for this API achieves everything you talk about -- or, ahem, it
</I>&gt;<i> will, once a few rough edges are taken care of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's practically no documentation about this API, and about application
</I>&gt;<i> development with OpenSim, so at this point almost no one knows about it.
</I>&gt;<i> This is because both the API and the module systems are still changing. You
</I>&gt;<i> have to download the code and bravely browse through it. In any case, the
</I>&gt;<i> module system(s) in OpenSim is still not as sophisticated as, say, a Tomcat
</I>&gt;<i> webapp (there are no resources, for example), but it is the beginning of
</I>&gt;<i> what you are looking for.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But first, a bit of an introduction. I'm a professional software developer
</I>&gt;<i> with years of experience working on all kinds of distributed applications. I
</I>&gt;<i> became a SL resident, scripter, and builder in early 2006. I'm just
</I>&gt;<i> beginning to get involved with OpenSim. This is a hobby for me, it is
</I>&gt;<i> unrelated to my work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For a while I've been thinking about &quot;application models&quot; for virtual
</I>&gt;<i> worlds. By &quot;application model&quot; I mean something that involves more than
</I>&gt;<i> simply scripting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A traditional application is a package of application code, shared
</I>&gt;<i> libraries, resources like images, etc. A platform's application model
</I>&gt;<i> defines the structure of these packages as well as things like the security
</I>&gt;<i> model, installation services, etc. To the user, an application represents a
</I>&gt;<i> consistent self-contained &quot;user experience,&quot; usually with a specific
</I>&gt;<i> purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of particular interest to me is the model for applications built *inside*a virtual world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A build of any level of complexity could be thought of as an application.
</I>&gt;<i> For example: a building with door and window scripts, an attachment with
</I>&gt;<i> configuration scripts, a vehicle, a stage with programed special effects for
</I>&gt;<i> a product presentation, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SL offers a very rudimentary application model. You can put copies of
</I>&gt;<i> scripts in prims and you can link a limited number of prims together. The
</I>&gt;<i> platform also provides a security model and a number of other services.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, the SL application model is missing a bunch of things. For example
</I>&gt;<i> we need a hierarchical prim model that supports any number of prims and at
</I>&gt;<i> region scale, a way to share and reuse script libraries, a way to update
</I>&gt;<i> things after they have been sold, given, or copied, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the complexity of builds increase, the missing features become quite
</I>&gt;<i> restrictive. This limits the ability of content creators to produce
</I>&gt;<i> compelling user experiences. That limits the adoption of the platform for
</I>&gt;<i> commercial purposes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, the SL script execution model is complex to implement
</I>&gt;<i> and requires a lot of computing resources. Specifically, treating global
</I>&gt;<i> script execution state as a persistent data store is very problematic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we need something better. But I also think that making something
</I>&gt;<i> that is really better could require moving away from the SL model in some
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental ways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
