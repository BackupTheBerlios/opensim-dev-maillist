<PRE>Diva, that way of laying things out helps me a lot. Yes, I agree that it is
a continuum. The lines certainly do get blurry.

 As I'm just an enthusiastic newbie new to all this OpenSim stuff, I have no
idea how it can all come together. But it sure is fun thinking about it
isn't it. :-)
I think one of the cool things about the managed code platform is that it
makes blurring the lines between data and code easier, especially with
things like the DLR.

I wonder how such things could be used to build a single set of apis that
work both in and out of the world?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What you describe is the API for extending the OpenSim itself. I'm sure
</I>&gt;<i> I'll have fun experimenting with it in the coming weeks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a common misunderstanding. The OpenSim API is an API for extending
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim, yes; as well as for *using* OpenSim: &quot;rezzing&quot; objects inworld,
</I>&gt;<i> linking them, unlinking them, moving them around, copying them, creating
</I>&gt;<i> agents, giving them an appearance, moving them around, talking to agents,
</I>&gt;<i> listening to them, etc etc etc -- everything you do with the SL viewer and
</I>&gt;<i> with libsl-based clients (and more) can be done programatically on the
</I>&gt;<i> backend using C#, dlls and the whole 9 yards, and bypassing inworld
</I>&gt;<i> scripting altogether. I could, for example, give you my DLL that implements
</I>&gt;<i> traffic in regions, and it will work out of the box in your regions after
</I>&gt;<i> some initial manual setup for resources -- that's the closest to an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;application&quot; you can get for the time being. I will make that available one
</I>&gt;<i> of these days as an example of developing OpenSim applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   However, what I'm trying to understand are the kinds of features that
</I>&gt;<i> make creating large and complex things in world easier. Usually you don't
</I>&gt;<i> think of building and scripting in world as creating an application, but
</I>&gt;<i> isn't that pretty much what it is? At least I find that thinking of it in
</I>&gt;<i> those terms helps me start think about how to make the task of building
</I>&gt;<i> complex things easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, applications is a good name. OpenSim allows you program them with
</I>&gt;<i> backend modules. For large, complex things it's the best way to go. The idea
</I>&gt;<i> of creating applications with inworld scripting is really cute, but only
</I>&gt;<i> takes you so far, because the object model exposed to scripts by the Linden
</I>&gt;<i> viewer is very limiting. What Stefan is talking about is way ahead; before
</I>&gt;<i> going wild with imagining other clients, I think it's worth looking at what
</I>&gt;<i> is already there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really encourage you and everyone to take a look at the OpenSim API. For
</I>&gt;<i> now, start with the SimpleExample code, even if it doesn't work. (I heard
</I>&gt;<i> that in some releases it is broken) Don't think of this API as &quot;just&quot; a way
</I>&gt;<i> to extend OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have fun!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   For example, it should be possible to link a set of prims, duplicate
</I>&gt;<i> that set many times, and then make a change to a prim in the set and have
</I>&gt;<i> that change replicated, automatically, to all the duplicates. Similarly, it
</I>&gt;<i> should be possible to create a library of script functions that can be
</I>&gt;<i> used by many scripts, without manually duplicating the script code over and
</I>&gt;<i> over. You can think of these things as part of an app model that supports
</I>&gt;<i> reusable components, something analogous to an assembly. Now you can start
</I>&gt;<i> thinking about how you would &quot;reference&quot; such a component for your build or
</I>&gt;<i> how you would distribute an updated version of the component.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to know how others thought about the current &quot;in world&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> application model and how it might be evolved. Is any work going on in that
</I>&gt;<i> area?

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim has a rudimentary application model, or even two: the one I'm most
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with are the region modules, and I think there's another module
</I>&gt;<i> system. They allow you to develop applications for the OpenSim API.
</I>&gt;<i> Developing for this API achieves everything you talk about -- or, ahem, it
</I>&gt;<i> will, once a few rough edges are taken care of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's practically no documentation about this API, and about application
</I>&gt;<i> development with OpenSim, so at this point almost no one knows about it.
</I>&gt;<i> This is because both the API and the module systems are still changing. You
</I>&gt;<i> have to download the code and bravely browse through it. In any case, the
</I>&gt;<i> module system(s) in OpenSim is still not as sophisticated as, say, a Tomcat
</I>&gt;<i> webapp (there are no resources, for example), but it is the beginning of
</I>&gt;<i> what you are looking for.

</I>&gt;<i>   I've got a few thoughts about scripting and I would like your feedback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But first, a bit of an introduction. I'm a professional software developer
</I>&gt;<i> with years of experience working on all kinds of distributed applications. I
</I>&gt;<i> became a SL resident, scripter, and builder in early 2006. I'm just
</I>&gt;<i> beginning to get involved with OpenSim. This is a hobby for me, it is
</I>&gt;<i> unrelated to my work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For a while I've been thinking about &quot;application models&quot; for virtual
</I>&gt;<i> worlds. By &quot;application model&quot; I mean something that involves more than
</I>&gt;<i> simply scripting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A traditional application is a package of application code, shared
</I>&gt;<i> libraries, resources like images, etc. A platform's application model
</I>&gt;<i> defines the structure of these packages as well as things like the security
</I>&gt;<i> model, installation services, etc. To the user, an application represents a
</I>&gt;<i> consistent self-contained &quot;user experience,&quot; usually with a specific
</I>&gt;<i> purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of particular interest to me is the model for applications built *inside*a virtual world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A build of any level of complexity could be thought of as an application.
</I>&gt;<i> For example: a building with door and window scripts, an attachment with
</I>&gt;<i> configuration scripts, a vehicle, a stage with programed special effects for
</I>&gt;<i> a product presentation, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SL offers a very rudimentary application model. You can put copies of
</I>&gt;<i> scripts in prims and you can link a limited number of prims together. The
</I>&gt;<i> platform also provides a security model and a number of other services.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, the SL application model is missing a bunch of things. For example
</I>&gt;<i> we need a hierarchical prim model that supports any number of prims and at
</I>&gt;<i> region scale, a way to share and reuse script libraries, a way to update
</I>&gt;<i> things after they have been sold, given, or copied, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the complexity of builds increase, the missing features become quite
</I>&gt;<i> restrictive. This limits the ability of content creators to produce
</I>&gt;<i> compelling user experiences. That limits the adoption of the platform for
</I>&gt;<i> commercial purposes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, the SL script execution model is complex to implement
</I>&gt;<i> and requires a lot of computing resources. Specifically, treating global
</I>&gt;<i> script execution state as a persistent data store is very problematic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we need something better. But I also think that making something
</I>&gt;<i> that is really better could require moving away from the SL model in some
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental ways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
