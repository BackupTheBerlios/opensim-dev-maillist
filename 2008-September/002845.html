<PRE>I have a builder bot that is based on libsl r1915 and modeled after the
testclient import command. I haven't seen any problems similar to yours when
I've used it with any versions of Opensim to date, but sometimes I do see
link failures when using it on the Linden grid.
I haven't seen that libsl client compatibility is currently a goal of any of
the opensim developers or of the team in general. Most testing is done with
the Linden viewer or derivatives. Given those constraints, I suspect making
use of the xml import functionality of Opensim may be the easiest path.

&gt;<i> As part of Prim Composer for 3ds Max, I'm writing a libomv-based
</I>&gt;<i> importer for SL and OpenSim.  The importer, called maxport, performs
</I>&gt;<i> this set of basic operations:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * rezzes prims, sets their position, name, and permissions
</I>&gt;<i> * uploads images, puts them in inventory, sets their permissions,
</I>&gt;<i> applies them to prims
</I>&gt;<i> * links prims
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This week I started using OpenSim's tags/0.5.9-released branch in SVN.
</I>&gt;<i> Previously, I was running the 0.5.8 binary release.  All of my testing
</I>&gt;<i> so far has been in standalone mode, basicphysics, and SQLite
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 0.5.8 seemed rock solid.  It took just about anything I could throw at
</I>&gt;<i> it.  Sometimes, I had to slow things down for it, but it worked
</I>&gt;<i> predictably.  0.5.9 seems less solid and in particular, I'm encountering
</I>&gt;<i> huge problems with linking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've created a series of data sets with 100, 200, and 400 prims.  And
</I>&gt;<i> also different amounts of linking, from no linking to 100 prim
</I>&gt;<i> linksets.  The naming convention is &quot;link_x_boxes_y&quot; which indicates
</I>&gt;<i> that it contains y boxes that are linked into x linksets.  So,
</I>&gt;<i> link_10_boxes_100 means that there are 100 prims that have been linked
</I>&gt;<i> into 10 linksets of 10 prims each.  link_2_boxes_100 means 100 prims in
</I>&gt;<i> 2 linksets of 50 prims each.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I started seeing problems immediately in 0.5.9.  link_2_boxes_4 should
</I>&gt;<i> produce 4 prims that are linked into two pairs of 2.  And it did this in
</I>&gt;<i> 0.5.8.  But in 0.5.9, it produced 3 prims that were linked together with
</I>&gt;<i> a 4th prim that was unlinked and out of position.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Larger linksets do even crazier things.  Linksets with 50 prims or more
</I>&gt;<i> will spontaneously link to other prims in the sim that were never
</I>&gt;<i> specified in the link request.  And I'm seeing duplicate prims that get
</I>&gt;<i> linked in strange ways.  Some of the duplicates get their position set
</I>&gt;<i> to half a sim away from where the originals were created.  It is bizarre.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would probably think that I'd done something wrong, except that the
</I>&gt;<i> same program works perfectly when run against 0.5.8.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seems like there is a multi-threading issue or something similar going
</I>&gt;<i> on that is causing things to go haywire inside of OpenSim 0.5.9 when
</I>&gt;<i> linking is done.  It's probably a small bug, but it is doing serious
</I>&gt;<i> damage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, here's the thing.  I have more information that I can provide.  I've
</I>&gt;<i> made a lot of observations.  I'd be glad to give you a compiled copy of
</I>&gt;<i> the program I'm using and the data I use to perform the tests.  Just let
</I>&gt;<i> me know what you'd like.
