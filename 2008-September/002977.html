+1.

If people really want to use DotNetEngine they can always flip it on in
the config, but it isn't getting any consistent love at this point.

The rationalization of the two engines ends up being a lot more work
than most people gave it credit for.  As such, I think it's a waste to
do that at this point.

Let's get 1 engine that works first.  I think the quickest path to doing
that is to rally behind the engine that is getting all the development
work, and actually has things like state saving, which are really quite
important here, and completely non trivial to add to DNE.
