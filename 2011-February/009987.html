<PRE>'February 7: Virtual Worlds and Gaming Live Case Day to be Livestreamed'

On February 7, 9:00 am to 4:30 pm CET, we will present the Virtual Worlds
and Gaming Live Case Day at the Stockholm School of Economics (SSE). During
this day, masters students from the Royal Institute of Technology and the
Stockholm School of Economics in Sweden will present their work conducted in
the Strategy Module of the Media Management Course.

During the three weeks of this module, the students have investigated in
their groups a number of strategic issues within the virtual worlds and
gaming industries in the US, Europe, and Asia. There will be 16 groups
making a 15 minute presentation each. Below is the schedule of the topics
that will be presented.

The Live Case Day will be livestreamed both onto the internet via our blog
(www.nordicworlds.net) as well as onto SSE&#185;s island in Second Life:

e. The twitter hashtag is #NVWN. The students&#185; slides will also be uploaded
to Slideshare and will have &#179;SSE&#178; in the name. To access the livestream,
check the NVWN blog: www.nordicworlds.net  on Monday. We will post a link

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have any strategic issues related to OpenSim that you would like to
</I>&gt;<i> have investigated?  I run a business strategy module in the Media Management
</I>&gt;<i> Course at the Stockholm School of Economics (SSE) and the Royal Institute of
</I>&gt;<i> Technology in late Jan/early Feb 2011.  As part of my course, I have the
</I>&gt;<i> students investigate real strategic issues in a live case component. Last year
</I>&gt;<i> the students interviewed avapreneurs in Second Life (avapreneur = avatar +
</I>&gt;<i> entrepreneur) and performed industry and competitor analyses of a variety of
</I>&gt;<i> industries within Second Life. Here is a write-up of the event:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://tinasuniversum.blogspot.com/2010/01/utbildning-i-second-life-avapreneur">http://tinasuniversum.blogspot.com/2010/01/utbildning-i-second-life-avapreneur</A>
</I>&gt;<i> ship.html. This year the focus of the live case component is Virtual Worlds
</I>&gt;<i> and the Gaming Industries, and as part of this, I am interested in the
</I>&gt;<i> students investigating issues related to OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The students are masters students from all over the world (e.g., Latin
</I>&gt;<i> America, North America, Europe, Africa, Asia) and attend either the Stockholm
</I>&gt;<i> School of Economics or the Royal Institute of Engineering in Stockholm. Here
</I>&gt;<i> is more info on the course:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.kth.se/en/studies/programmes/master/programmes/it/2.7397/media-mana">http://www.kth.se/en/studies/programmes/master/programmes/it/2.7397/media-mana</A>
</I>&gt;<i> gement-1.8554. I teach module 1 in this course. This year there are more than
</I>&gt;<i> 60 students, who will work in groups of four, there will be 15-20 groups
</I>&gt;<i> working on a variety of issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I was wondering if you would like to have a student group work on one or
</I>&gt;<i> two strategic issues related to your work in OpenSim. Here are some potential
</I>&gt;<i> questions, but others are welcome as long as they are of a business strategy
</I>&gt;<i> nature:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Industry analysis, e.g., how profitable is the serious gaming industry (or
</I>&gt;<i> any other industry of relevance) in country x?
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Competitor analysis of one or more competitors, e.g., what is the
</I>&gt;<i> competitive advantage of company x?
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Trend analysis, e.g., how are the PEST (political, economic, social,
</I>&gt;<i> technological) trends impacting a specific industry?
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Business model analysis, e.g., what business models are emerging in
</I>&gt;<i> industry x? 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Value network analysis, e.g., what networks are necessary in industry y?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The students prepare a powerpoint report based on their analyses and will
</I>&gt;<i> present them at the end of my module in the course (module 1) on February 7.
</I>&gt;<i> We are planning an &#179;Exploring Virtual Worlds and Gaming Industries Day&#178;, an
</I>&gt;<i> open day in which the presentations will be streamed from our classroom in
</I>&gt;<i> Stockholm onto the internet and onto SSE&#185;s island in SL.  This event will
</I>&gt;<i> occur from 10:15 am to 17:00 pm CET. They will also be recorded and posted on
</I>&gt;<i> the Nordic Virtual Worlds Network website: www.nordicworlds.net.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know if you have a strategic issue you would like to learn more
</I>&gt;<i> about or if you have any other questions. You may contact me directly at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">robin.teigland at hhs.se.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you and I hope to hear from some of you!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best, 
</I>&gt;<i>
