<PRE>Our experience of the move from 0.6.9 to 0.7.0 and then to 0.7.1 dev 
version (to get access to improvements we wanted such as media on a 
prim, support for viewer 2 and now mesh objects) was very good, after 
some early verification issues on HG teleports were 
resolved.  Remember that HG telephoning between 0.6.9 and 0.7.x is 
not possible due to enhanced security.

I believe that the current released 0.7.0.2 and 0.7.1 dev version are 
both much more stable than 0.6.9.  But you have to take care with 
0.7.1 dev versions as individual commits can break some things until 
they are tested, and there are therefore some specific revisions 
which just don't work especially with HG teleports and avatar 
verification between grids.  As we are so close to 0.7.1 release 
candidates its probably wise now to wait for that.

BUT... PLEASE... make sure you start from the .ini.file examples in 
the release itself and incorporate the necessary changes for your 
environment first to get it working.   Then add in the other .ini 
file changes you want to after its working.  Remember that some 
lesser used config file settings are now in OpenSimDefaults.ini.  You 
can though bring any settings you want to change and override them in 
your own OpenSi,.ini again. Take great care with the creation of the 
.ini files as a LOT has changed.

But once you are over that step, I think you will enjoy 0.7.1.
