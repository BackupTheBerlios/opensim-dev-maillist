<PRE>I'm sorry for you, fellow american developers, for having to fight with all
of these &quot;software patents&quot; (or &quot;patent the next stupid idea I have but I
have no idea of how to make it possible&quot;) crap.

Anyway I agree with parts of  your points 1 (not talking here about patents)
and number 5 (wait to see what happens) and agree completely with Mark
Malewski last post (&quot;software patents reduce innovation&quot;) and disagree
completely about if companies are evil or not for patenting these things:
they are, even Google, IBM and all of these:when the money income goes down,
the lawyers go up.

Greetings from a (nowadays) quite free country in Europe.

2011/2/3 dz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">dz at bitzend.net</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> Once again,
</I>&gt;<i>   a tempest in a teapot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I, for one,  would remind people of some of the things we have learned
</I>&gt;<i> about patent discussions on this list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  It is FAR more detrimental to the OpenSim movement if detailed patent
</I>&gt;<i> information is posted here..   Reading those patents is a VERY bad idea for
</I>&gt;<i> anyone who wants to contribute.  DON'T DO IT
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. People who squawk about VALUABLE members of our small community are
</I>&gt;<i> generally exposing their ignorance of the importance of having OpenSim based
</I>&gt;<i> companies survive, flourish, and operate in a businesslike manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. People who choose to  freak out over the ruination of  the OpenSim world
</I>&gt;<i> BECAUSE of A patent POSSIBLY being granted.. have their head in the sand and
</I>&gt;<i> should wake up.   That's the way the software world WORKS NOW.  If you wanna
</I>&gt;<i> be PISSED OF about something and spend your efforts to FIX something
</I>&gt;<i> important,  get involved in requesting the US DOJ look at MicroSofts'
</I>&gt;<i> lightly veiled approach to lead a consortium to purchase Novells LINUX
</I>&gt;<i> patent portfolio...
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20110120094059746&lt;http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20110120094059746">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20110120094059746&lt;http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20110120094059746</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  If you want to insure OpenSim has minimal patent liabilities,  talk to
</I>&gt;<i> the core developers who are willing to turn a blind eye and continue to
</I>&gt;<i> believe MicroSoft when they say  &quot;Of course,  you don't need to worry one
</I>&gt;<i> NIT over the fact that .NET and C## are  fully entangled into our
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary technology and we sorta might wont ever sue anyone for using
</I>&gt;<i> THAT....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. There are MANY companies whos patents we DEPEND on.  Many of the core
</I>&gt;<i> developers over the history of this project are employed by companies who
</I>&gt;<i> rank in the top 10 patents holders in the world.  These companies are NOT
</I>&gt;<i> evil BECAUSE they filed for patents.  When the day comes that Kyle and the
</I>&gt;<i> folks at Reaction Grid USE the patent to inhibit the development of
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim,  THEN  I will encourage you to get irate.   Until then,  I think
</I>&gt;<i> Kyles'  &amp; Reaction Grids continuous and dedicated efforts to SERVE the
</I>&gt;<i> opensim community, and do the right thing are what I would be  spending my
</I>&gt;<i> efforts posting about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> D
