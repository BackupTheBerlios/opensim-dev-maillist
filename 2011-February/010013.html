I'm currently still using 0.6.9 as there are one or two things I need to do 
before moving. I am looking forward to some of the improvements in 0.7 but 
some of the things discussed on the IRC channel make me wonder what features 
I may run in to that have broken in 0.7 that were working in 0.6.9. Most of 
the breakage seems to be in git master and those things are getting fixed. 
Moving to 0.7 should be safe as long as I stick to the released source 
packages of 0.7 and stay away from git master.

&gt;<i>  Indeed, I find myself not sure if it's worth reporting bugs I find in 0.6.9
</I>
It's probably not worth reporting 0.6.9 bugs. AFAIK, all the main OS 
developers are on 0.7 and would have little to no interest in any more 
changes for 0.6.9 code. The best you could do would be to find out if a bug 
was fixed in 0.7 and whether you can cherry pick the 0.7 fix in to the 0.6.9 
branch of code.

I should just add that I'm not one of the main OS developers.
