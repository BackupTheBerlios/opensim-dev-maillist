Git master actually seems pretty good at the moment.  I believe that the major thing we're waiting on before branching 
for release candidates are fixes for parcel prim counts.

OpenSim 0.7.1 will be considerable performance improvement on 0.6.9.  However, I recommend setting a fair amount of time 
for any migration, since a large amount of configuration has changed.  Also be aware that the MySQL DLL in git master is 
known to break during some migrations - so it's still worth waiting for the release candidates where this problem will 
be resolved.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> It's probably not worth reporting 0.6.9 bugs. AFAIK, all the main OS developers are on 0.7 and would have little to no
</I>&gt;<i> interest in any more changes for 0.6.9 code. The best you could do would be to find out if a bug was fixed in 0.7 and
</I>&gt;<i> whether you can cherry pick the 0.7 fix in to the 0.6.9 branch of code.
</I>
This is certainly true for me.  My current base of operations is 'near master' code (though not master itself, I'm not 
that crazy!).
