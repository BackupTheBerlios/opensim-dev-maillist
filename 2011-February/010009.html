<PRE>My current projects and developments are still focussed on 0.6.9 since it
seems stable, copes OK with tens of users and supports most of the
functionality I've needed.  I do peer enviously over the fence of course, at
shared media and improvements to the avatar appearance and inventory code.
 Indeed, I find myself not sure if it's worth reporting bugs I find in 0.6.9
- so the question is should I bite the bullet now? I'd be very keen on any
anecdotal reports on the stability and performance of the 0.7x releases.  I
realise performance is the proverbial piece of multi-dimensional string, but
anything along the lines of &quot;We run happily with 30 AVs in a region with
lots of scripted objects' or 'when we have 10 AVs logging in at roughly the
same time to a region things hang for minutes' - just to get a feeling.
 Typical use cases would be meetings and training where many AVs would log
in within a short space of time or simultaneously.  I'm happy to collate and
blog any responses, or not if people don't want that!
