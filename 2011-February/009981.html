<PRE>Once again,
  a tempest in a teapot.

I, for one,  would remind people of some of the things we have learned about
patent discussions on this list.

1.  It is FAR more detrimental to the OpenSim movement if detailed patent
information is posted here..   Reading those patents is a VERY bad idea for
anyone who wants to contribute.  DON'T DO IT

2. People who squawk about VALUABLE members of our small community are
generally exposing their ignorance of the importance of having OpenSim based
companies survive, flourish, and operate in a businesslike manner.

3. People who choose to  freak out over the ruination of  the OpenSim world
BECAUSE of A patent POSSIBLY being granted.. have their head in the sand and
should wake up.   That's the way the software world WORKS NOW.  If you wanna
be PISSED OF about something and spend your efforts to FIX something
important,  get involved in requesting the US DOJ look at MicroSofts'
lightly veiled approach to lead a consortium to purchase Novells LINUX
patent portfolio...
<A HREF="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20110120094059746&lt;http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20110120094059746">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20110120094059746&lt;http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20110120094059746</A>&gt;

4.  If you want to insure OpenSim has minimal patent liabilities,  talk to
the core developers who are willing to turn a blind eye and continue to
believe MicroSoft when they say  &quot;Of course,  you don't need to worry one
NIT over the fact that .NET and C## are  fully entangled into our
proprietary technology and we sorta might wont ever sue anyone for using
THAT....

5. There are MANY companies whos patents we DEPEND on.  Many of the core
developers over the history of this project are employed by companies who
rank in the top 10 patents holders in the world.  These companies are NOT
evil BECAUSE they filed for patents.  When the day comes that Kyle and the
folks at Reaction Grid USE the patent to inhibit the development of
OpenSim,  THEN  I will encourage you to get irate.   Until then,  I think
Kyles'  &amp; Reaction Grids continuous and dedicated efforts to SERVE the
opensim community, and do the right thing are what I would be  spending my
efforts posting about.
