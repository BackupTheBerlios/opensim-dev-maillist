<PRE>Hi all!

 

A couple of days ago I posted an email to the opensim users mailing list
about a problem I had each time I turned an object into physical.  

In short, the error was:

2011-02-21 04:23:44,802 DEBUG -
OpenSim.Region.Framework.Scenes.SceneObjectGroup [SCENE]: Storing Wooden
Crate, 0a0b9dfa-ca2e-44cb-bdad-89f6b4cd84e8 in Fokides 5

2011-02-21 04:23:44,805 ERROR - OpenSim.Data.MySQL.MySQLDataStore [REGION
DB]: MySQL error in ExecuteNonQuery: Unknown column 'NaN' in 'field list'

2011-02-21 04:23:44,807 ERROR -
OpenSim.Region.Framework.Scenes.SceneObjectGroup [SCENE]: Storing of Wooden
Crate, 0a0b9dfa-ca2e-44cb-bdad-89f6b4cd84e8 in Fokides 5 failed with
exception MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlException: Unknown column 'NaN' in
'field list'

 

Since it couldn't be saved in the database, every physical object simply
disappeared from my sim after restarting the server.

 

Teravus kindly replied making a couple of suggestions that unfortunately
couldn't fix the problem.

The only thing that I've noticed is that in the SW region and in the region
directly above. Physical prims were always working OK.

 

So I decided to uninstall MySQL, delete the database, delete diva-r13981
folder and start from scratch an empty 4X4 regions totally flat estate which
looks like this: 

 

4              8              12           16

3              7              11           15

2              6              10           14           

1              5              9              13

 

The coordinates I'm using are:

8100,8100

8100,8101

8100,8102

8100,8103

8101,8100

8101,8101

8101,8102

8101,8103

8102,8100

8102,8101

8102,8102

8102,8103

8103,8100

8103,8101

8103,8102

8103,8103

 

In each region I rezzed a simple cube (16 in total) and the only attributes
I changed in each one was to tick: 

everyone can move

everyone can copy

show in search

physical

Nothing more and no scripts.  I also didn't move them from their initial
position.

 

I checked the table prims in MySQL and all 16 prims were saved there.

I used the quit command to shutdown the server.

Rechecked the table prims in MySQL and all 16 prims were saved.

Restarted the server and 6 out of 16 prims were missing.

Re-rezzed the missing ones and a couple of simple non physical cubes close
to them. NaN problems started and not all could be saved to the database
after a shutdown.

Restarted the server, 6 out of 16 were left.

Restarted once more, only 2 were left (in regions 1 and 2).

Re-rezzed all 16 plus 16 non physical and as you might guess, after a
restart, some were missing once again.

 

Tried MySQL 5.1.5.0 64bit, 5.1.5.0 32bit, 5.1.5.4 64bit each time with the
same results.

At this point I gave up hope in solving the problem.

 

Opensim version: Diva r13981 

OS: Win7 64bit.

Viewer: Imprudence 1.3.0  (Oct  7 2010 02:31:57)

 

The only changes that I made in Diva (besides myworld.ini and
regionconfig.ini) are in opensim.ini where 

I enabled clouds

I enabled freeswitch (but that's another story)

Added the lines meshing=meshmerizer

Usemeshiesphysics=true

 

Since I don't know if I can post attachments, I'm uploading the
OpenSim.32BitLaunch.log and an Excel file that contains the prims table of
MySQL in the various states of restart and shutdown in the following
address:

<A HREF="http://www.rhodes.aegean.gr/ptde/personel/fokides/helpme.htm">http://www.rhodes.aegean.gr/ptde/personel/fokides/helpme.htm</A>

 

 

I don't know if I'm doing something completely stupid which results in this
problem, or if it's a bug.

So, any help will be much appreciated.

 

Regards

Manos
