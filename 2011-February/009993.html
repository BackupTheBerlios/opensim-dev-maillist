<PRE>Can someone help explain about map tiles and how they show up in Viewer 2.4.x?

I know that there is the Simian Grid map module which can allow for 
upload and serving of such map tiles in a compatible way.. as that 
was mentioned on this list a few weeks ago.

But I don't run a front end such as Simian that serves them.  YET... 
at one time I seemed to have the map tiles served at one level of 
resolution for all three of our OpenSim.ini instances across three 
hosts.  How could that have happened?

The samples are reported in a mantis entry I did at the time snmce 
not all map tile resolutions were served even then...
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=5355">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=5355</A>

But if you look at the first level image attached to that Mantis 
report... file name SL-Viewer-2-Map-Level-1.jpg  ... all the Openvue 
grid regions tiles are showing .. even though the null areas around 
them look like they come from LL map servers for the equivalent x,y 
map tile location!

Anyone help explain what is going on and a suitable way to get it 
working if it can be made to work. I am using a Diva Wifi front end 
not Simian just now.
