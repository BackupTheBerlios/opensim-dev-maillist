<PRE>Dear Justin,

Thanks for your reply and guidance!

I have noticed that load balancer project is not alive, and neither it
does similar stuff to ourselves, but it was good to learn from, being a
completely new one to the framework.

Thanks for mentioning the Intel work, of course that is important, for me
and met Dan in a workshop in TAIWAN. That's really good that everyone is
using OpenSim now.

I read the article how to overcome the issues with megaregions using OARs,
however, we will definitely require a framework for the remaining things
as you mentioned.

Thanks again for your positive and encouraging reply, hopefully, we would
be able to contribute something regarding our work. I will keep updating
about the project, and might be asking for further help if the community
don't mind. btw, do we have some published paper on OpenSim to use as a
reference in further publications?

Best wishes and have a good day.

Umar

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am a PhD student at the University of East Anglia Norwich, and working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on dynamic load distribution for achieving scalable and consistent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> virtual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worlds. First, of all thanks for all the hard work this community is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for making OpenSimulator a reality as an open source framework. We have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conducted a survey of the open source frameworks and found that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator is the best choice for the implementation of our work. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> studying the Load Balancer project that was initiated by Mike Mazur et
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> al,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but we believe in a world without game specific concepts. We (I and my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Supervisor) are keen to start a project for the dynamic distribution of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> load, using the basic framework and additional work of this community
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our work that is described below:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Project Description: We have developed and simulated a number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strategies and algorithms that dynamically distributes current load of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server in to a number of smaller sub-regions (either 4 or 9 based on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> avatar placement).  We use an aggregation algorithm to get two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contiguous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> areas, to avoid resource under-utilisation. This is because some regions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might have no players at all. We delegate one aggregate to a new server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while keeping the other with the current server.  The newly selected
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server becomes child of the server that initiated splitting.  Later on,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the capacity further increases, sub-regions in megaregions are assigned
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other servers. However, the levels in the Resource Management Tree are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kept at minimum by making parent server based on split and not only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assignment.  The project aims achieving scalability by physical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the world maintaining the world in a hierarchical fashion, and Time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Management in a decentralised manner considering only adjacent regions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sharing physical boundaries (based on inherent properties of virtual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worlds). We have identified and simulated this work with a number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple scenarios.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What we think:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.	Using a megaregion initially and then splitting it into two different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> megaregions, delegating one to a new server that becomes child of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first server.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.	Using OAR files to store the contents and load it one by one in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> megaregion on the new server.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3.	Using serialization concept to transfer the avatars of the regions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> moved to a new server.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We would be great, if this community help us identify the components
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already developed that might help us and give me a proper direction to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start with this work (that might be an extended project of Region
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Modules). We are committed to contribute to this community and continue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this work beyond my PhD work. Thanks a lot for your help and support.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Best wishes and hope to hear from some you about this proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Umar - great to hear about your project.  The load balancer project
</I>&gt;<i> hasn't been maintained for many years old now and
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect that the code is no longer operational.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Much more recent work on performance topics has been done by Intel, though
</I>&gt;<i> not all this work is currently not
</I>&gt;<i> open-source afaik.  There is a selection of papers at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://techresearch.intel.com/ProjectDetails.aspx?Id=154.">http://techresearch.intel.com/ProjectDetails.aspx?Id=154.</A>  But I'm
</I>&gt;<i> sure that you're very well aware of those since I see both Intel folks and
</I>&gt;<i> yourself presented at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.pap.vs.uni-due.de/MMVE10/">http://www.pap.vs.uni-due.de/MMVE10/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Megaregions may well be a good place to start.  However, I believe there
</I>&gt;<i> are teleporting and OAR loading issues with
</I>&gt;<i> them.  However, these problems may not affect you.  I believe there are
</I>&gt;<i> Google-able ways to load OARs on megaregions but
</I>&gt;<i> it's not something that I've done myself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Without having read too closely, I would bet that you'll need additional
</I>&gt;<i> framework and maybe generalization of existing
</I>&gt;<i> components to do your work.  I would say that we're very happy to accept
</I>&gt;<i> patches that make OpenSim more componentized
</I>&gt;<i> and open to architectural experimentation.  Maintaining stability is also
</I>&gt;<i> very good and for me personally, having
</I>&gt;<i> patches that contribute automated tests that confirm this is even better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
