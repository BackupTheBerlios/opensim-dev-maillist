So in the development of a metaverse...  are you under the impression that
all content created for use in such an environment should be completely free
and open-sourced like OS is?  I ask this because with client side storage of
assets, you are removing any protection content creators have that their
content won't be duplicated and resold.  I don't know about you...  but I
don't know that many content creators who have the resources to seek legal
action against the number of people that will exploit local asset storage.

I, for one, will not be all that interested in developing quality content
for a system which affords my work no protection.  I don't know that many
people who currently create content for SL who would do so either.  It seems
an awful waste of talent.

I will continue to test my grid and offer what I can in that realm, and
offer my insights into end-user functionality... which should be a major
focus in the development cycle, but I am not sure where the benefit is to a
metaverse which will end up less secure for content creators... and their
Intellectual Property... than the internet we have today.

No offense intended, just my take on things.
