At present, my concern was that inventory assets would be stored locally.
That's all.  :)

</I>

I can appreciate this, though the decision to store inventory assets locally
could become a major burden later if implemented now.  I responded to an
post addressing locally stored inventory assets, as that is truly my only
major concern at this stage of the game.


&gt;<i> I personally think that once OpenSIM moves into a more Beta/Production

</I>

Well, as far as this topic is concerned, I don't see the need to patch in
DRM yet.  If inventory assets end up being stored locally, that will
probably change my mind considerably.
