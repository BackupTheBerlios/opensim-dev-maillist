</I>It seems to me that there are two problems with reaping assets

1)  Many LSL functions allow you to reference assets directly by UUID, 
so they could not be referenced in the database yet are still expected 
to exist.

2)  In grid mode, currently disconnected regions may be references 
assets in their region stores.  Checking whether any of these reference 
an asset would be a difficult (if not effectively impossible) task.
