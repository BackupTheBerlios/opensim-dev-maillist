&gt;<i> &gt; As far as I know, there is no simulation environment that is both
</I>&gt;<i> accurate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in terms of physics modeling, and affordable and social at the same
</I>&gt;<i> time. An
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; environment like that would be a major enabler for lots of cool stuff --
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; word used these day is &quot;transformative&quot;. 
</I>
Hear hear! This is of course more or less what is proposed in works like
Snow Crash and The Matrix (without Mr. Smith antagonizing Neo, it would have
been a cool place to hang).

I'm also thinking of
&gt;<i> &gt; special-purpose, not necessarily affordable, clients for it like the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cave&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; down at UCSD, a fully immersive 3D environment where you can physically
</I>&gt;<i> move
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; around the objects, using special goggles -- it's such an intense
</I>&gt;<i> feeling!
</I>
I know the Cave quite well -- a family friend was one of the core developers
(Tom DeFanti, big SigGraph guy).  It's an amazing thing to experience it; it
really gives you a feel for where this stuff is headed.  But long before a
cave is as common as a hot tub, you'll have 3D goggles and home user mo-cap
using webcams and bracelets.  

This sort of interface is actually quite important because the present game
paradigm of joystick/cursor control of one's avatar and menu-based
manipulation of objects is not nearly precise or immersive enough to
integrate well with a serious physics simulation.

&gt;<i> &gt; Just imagine the wonders that that would do for real world systems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; engineering! (ok, and for sexual and warlordy fantasies too, but you
</I>&gt;<i> don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need good physics for those :-)
</I>
Hmm... I think physics is an integral part of sexual congress, but I
digress...

&gt;<i> Imagine a world where entities are not controlled but programmed. In C#,
</I>&gt;<i> lsl, etc. You get sensor data and you have to make your entity or entities
</I>&gt;<i> win and conquer others.
</I>&gt;<i> Physics and sensors information can open unimaginable new possibilities.
</I>
&gt;<i> The first issue I can think of is that not only animation based movement
</I>&gt;<i> (not controlled by physics) but articulated based movement (controlled by
</I>&gt;<i> physics) will be used. Maybe the physics based movement can be translated
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> animation based movement for SL compatibility.
</I>
I've said this before, but I think there are major issues with integrating a
truly accurate simulation with the animation approach of videogame design. 
There are algorithms out there that can take an animation file and transform
it into physically realistic commands to a 'robot', where robot includes
something like an articulated avatar with virtual muscles.  If you cheat and
just make the object follow the animation script, you will have non-physical
things like infinite forces and such, which can destabilize the simulation.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second issue is that using Collada can be a good idea (physics and
</I>&gt;<i> visual information in the same format), the ogrecollada project is very
</I>&gt;<i> active now (openviewer will use Ogre3d, right?) and I am going to add
</I>&gt;<i> collada physics support to mine soon also. I don't know how can this be
</I>&gt;<i> mixed with current SL mesh format.
</I>
The SL problem is that it's prim based, and the rest of the world is
mesh-based.  We've discussed this before, and I think the consensus view is
that mesh capabilities need to exist in the viewer to do almost everything
we're talking about.  If SL doesn't want to go that way, I predict the
client will fork sooner rather than later.

Yes, but at the risk of repeating myself, the real challenge is to integrate
non-physical scripting (such as motion-captured avatar moves) with the
physics in a sane and consistent way.  This is a large part of my day
research -- trying to get a bipedal robot to do what you want it to do,
while respecting the laws of physics.  It turns out to be (almost) as
difficult to do this in a realistic simulation as it is in reality.  

What I'm getting at is, if you want your avatar to walk around in a
physically realistic simulation, you have to treat it like a robot -- you
can't just shove a .bvh file into the mix.

&gt;<i> Doing that work in a separated branch will not be needed if it can be
</I>&gt;<i> modularized away (right thing to do, don't know how difficult it can
</I>&gt;<i> become).
</I>
I believe that will prove difficult/impossible in the short term.  There are
deep issues with event management that reach their messy tentacles through
all of the code; IMSHO it will be difficult to research physics while
staying compatible with what exists today.
