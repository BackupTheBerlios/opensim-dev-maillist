</I>not really. there's not much to solve. aside from scripts, everything 
else is already copyable via the client as the client has to render the 
virtual world, so it gets prim info, textures.

scripts are only &quot;protected&quot; as long as the grid &quot;protects&quot; them. 
there's nothing that prevents me from adding support to my OpenSim copy 
that will give me access to scripts stored on my grid. sure you can then 
refuse to sell your content on my grid, but once we have 
intergrid-connections (and i guess that's one of the goals to achieve a 
web-like virtual universe consisting of interconnected grids), that  
becomes a bit problematic as avatars will expect to be able to take 
their assets with them to whatever grid they visit. the only thing we 
could do is add &quot;export allowed to...&quot; permissions and then you could 
specify grids that you trust (or specify whose certification you trust)...

&quot;permissions&quot; are really just &quot;license digests&quot;: they allow you to 
signal your intent to the user. that's about it.

and, no, for various reasons DRM is not the solution. it just doesn't work.

    cheers,
