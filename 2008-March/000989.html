<PRE>Hi Burnman,
I can see where your concern is coming from and I agree that content 
creators will indeed need some sort of protection.. maybe encryption of 
the data when uploaded to the client inventory would be a possibility.  
I understand that there is still a risk involved where an individual 
might be able to crack this encryption, but this would not be possible 
for the average user and therefore could offer a very good degree of 
security for your content.
Even now, there are  people who can steal your content in SL although it 
is very difficult and therefore the average user can't do it.

just my thoughts.....
-Terry

</I>&gt;<i>     grids (or buildings) and users that move from one to the other
</I>&gt;<i>     much like we do in RL. That will mean that the notion of inventory
</I>&gt;<i>     will need to evolve to avoid your notions becoming extinct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in the development of a metaverse...  are you under the impression 
</I>&gt;<i> that all content created for use in such an environment should be 
</I>&gt;<i> completely free and open-sourced like OS is?  I ask this because with 
</I>&gt;<i> client side storage of assets, you are removing any protection content 
</I>&gt;<i> creators have that their content won't be duplicated and resold.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't know about you...  but I don't know that many content creators 
</I>&gt;<i> who have the resources to seek legal action against the number of 
</I>&gt;<i> people that will exploit local asset storage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I, for one, will not be all that interested in developing quality 
</I>&gt;<i> content for a system which affords my work no protection.  I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> know that many people who currently create content for SL who would do 
</I>&gt;<i> so either.  It seems an awful waste of talent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will continue to test my grid and offer what I can in that realm, 
</I>&gt;<i> and offer my insights into end-user functionality... which should be a 
</I>&gt;<i> major focus in the development cycle, but I am not sure where the 
</I>&gt;<i> benefit is to a metaverse which will end up less secure for content 
</I>&gt;<i> creators... and their Intellectual Property... than the internet we 
</I>&gt;<i> have today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No offense intended, just my take on things.
