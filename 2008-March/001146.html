Don't think I can, since its a risk actually that all programmers at all
times face, whether it be from being accused of transgressing License A,
or copyright B, or patent C -- any and all IP -- especially in the US
where such things are taken very seriously.

What makes this case &quot;unique&quot; is that this is really an issue specific
to LL's relationship to OpenSim. OpenSim's core developers do not appear
to trust LL period. Therefore I suggest, Rob, that you and perhaps other
LL stakeholders might want to speak directly with them about this
specific issue, since I in no way represent OpenSim core developers (I'm
just relating what they told me).

As examples of past behavior that elicits concern, I believe the
examples of SCO (good turned evil) and mp3/Fraunhofer (ambiguous
assertion of IP rights) as situations OpenSim feels it should avoid.

A number of large companies interesting in OpenSim have no doubt had
their lawyers influence this conservative stance.

What something I would suggest might look like is: &quot;LL announces a
partnership with OpenSim for extending SL metaverse, including cross
licensing of IP rights, and a GPL exception for OpenSim's BSD&quot;. But
that's just off the top of my head. Surely LL lawyers could do better in
cooperation with OpenSim core devs (which I am not one).
