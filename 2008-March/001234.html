<PRE>I previous positions, I have worked with trademarks. My recollection is that a trademark applies to the visual representation of the item trademarked &#8211; which why it is different from a copyright; which is also why a Mark Drawing is required for the trademark application.

 

Hence, LL can trademark the logo &#8216;Grid&#8217;, they cannot trademark the word.  LL would not be able to make a claim against OSGrid or CentralGrid unless they used the identical logo as LL&#8217;s &#8216;Grid&#8217;.

I kind of like the &quot;verse&quot; of metaverse in place of grid.  It's short 
and lends itself well to names like OSVerse, CentralVerse, 
OpenSim.Verse.AssetServer.exe, and etc.  The different verses are all 
parts of the larger metaverse.

Actually, no cyberpun(k) intended; but 'Matrix' is a descriptive term 
for this (legacy and rather unimaginative) arrangement of nodes. Quite 
possibly the bland term 'table' would work as well. 'Lattice' is 
probably what we want, what with groups of groups and all. (A lattice 
can be formed by sub-lattices)
 
Or, why don't we just leave the 2d-flat earth notion of a 
grid/matrix/table/lattice and move our mindsets more towards a 'Net', 
'Whorl', 'Dispersion', 'Maelstrom' or 'Interjectory'?
 
Yours dispersed thru time and space,

PS: All this aside, I say we write everything LL or SL - trademark - 
derivative  -out- of the core and wiki ASAP. God only Knows where LL is 
headed what with recent movements and events. Let's pose it 'the great 
mental cast off' DS.

 &gt;
 &gt; Ah yes, but there is also the issues of OSGrid, CentralGrid, etc..
 &gt;
 &gt; And our prolific use of the term in various places, etc.. Will this
 &gt; cause an issue?
 &gt;
 &gt; I still cannot believe their trademarked Hippo - that wasn't even a LL
 &gt; creation - their users started that in beta.
