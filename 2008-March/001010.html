</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Noted.  ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Your arguments are spot on. :) I would add that having DRM or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         attempting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         to curtail end users fredom of use is pushing society to being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         untrustable. There is an old saying. Say something often
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         enough and it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         becomes true. Say people WILL steal content at times, be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         paranoid about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         it and far more people WILL steal your content due to lack of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         respect ,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         which is earned by the creator's lack of trust in others.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is no paranoia in the valid concern that people will attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rip you off.  It happens all the time.  It will never cease to amaze
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me how entitled people feel to other people's Intellectual Property.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; THAT is where the lack of respect and trust comes into play.  An
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; artist or author who wishes to protect their work from those who are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; low enough to steal from them should not be looked on as paranoid,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they are simply trying to enforce their rights under law.  Theft is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where the lack of respect and trust come from.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People feel entitled because there is a cultural shift being forced from
</I>&gt;<i> works of art belonging to society in the past to works of art belonging
</I>&gt;<i> to a single person in modern society. I believe that this shift is
</I>&gt;<i> completely artificial in nature and is being forced upon us by the few.
</I>&gt;<i> If you look back to tribal times  music and literature was never owned
</I>&gt;<i> by a single artist. It was the fabric of the tribe and belonged to
</I>&gt;<i> everyone in the tribe. Granted that there was a preferred storyteller or
</I>&gt;<i> musician, but that was decided by skill of reenacting and presentation
</I>&gt;<i> than through ownership.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also believe that an artists creativity is a direct result of their
</I>&gt;<i> social environment, never somethign that was a pure invention. Anyone
</I>&gt;<i> that pretends that music, literature, art etc comes from 100% within is
</I>&gt;<i> blind to the fact that what is within was generated by the culture
</I>&gt;<i> around them. I personally do not see how can one claim ownership of such
</I>&gt;<i> a circular flow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Keep in mind that I do heartilly agree that artists must be supported
</I>&gt;<i> due to their gifts of interpretation. In the past the artists were paid
</I>&gt;<i> not for their music but for their performance. In tribes the artists
</I>&gt;<i> were supported by their tribe so that they were free to pursue art.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         However if you as a creator can bring yourself to see the good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         others, most will respect you enough to not steal your work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         You will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         still have some minor theft happening, but not nearly enough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         to stop you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         from creating and profiting from your creations. This is just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         life and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         society in general and unavoidable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By your argument, we should do away with police and trust people to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behave themselves.  Simply because it is impossible to prevent all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; theft, does not mean we should just give up in our attempts to make it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difficult.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, my argument is that we stop trying to add bodyguards, and big
</I>&gt;<i> brother 24x7 monitoring and instead return to enforcing consequences. I
</I>&gt;<i> think you misunderstood what I was saying. I could have worded this much
</I>&gt;<i> better. ;-P
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Here's another parallel to the whole DRM debate. We trust each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         other to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         not run around killing people. We don't walk around wearing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         100%
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         protective body armour because, well, it's impossibly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         expensive, and no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         one will trust you due to your obvious paranoia. ;) Instead,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         we walk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         around with no armour at all, yet the threat of serious bodily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         harm is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         still there, and we manage to survive just fine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tell that to the two teenagers who were shot to death across town here
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; last week.  They were in their driveway playing basketball.  Or the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; elderly man who was gunned down in his driveway a few towns away the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; week before that.  The danger is there, and it would certainly be far
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worse if there were no police to keep it relatively in check.  While
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is no such thing as 100% safe, we are more safe due to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protections in place.  This analogy works just as well for asset
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protection in a metaverse environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you missed my point here. Were they paranoid about it enough to
</I>&gt;<i> be wearing full battle armour just because they were exposed to the
</I>&gt;<i> outside world? No. They were not. Instead they trusted the outside world
</I>&gt;<i> and something bad happened to them. That is life. To believe that there
</I>&gt;<i> is such a thing as perfect safety is willfull ignorance of reality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our protection exists NOT from a DRM like response to the dangers, but
</I>&gt;<i> through the enforcement of consequences of actions.  Artists keep saying
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;there's no way to protect other than DRM&quot; is akin to saying &quot;there's no
</I>&gt;<i> way to protect against murder other than everyone wearing full body
</I>&gt;<i> armour and being watched 24x7&quot;.  Instead, artists need to realize that
</I>&gt;<i> the only way to protect themselves is through repairing the chain of
</I>&gt;<i> trust that used to exist. I believe that in order to repair that trust,
</I>&gt;<i> artists must abandon this &quot;modern&quot; idea of ownership and go back to the
</I>&gt;<i> symbiotic relationship of the old ways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are already seeing the first results of some artists that are going
</I>&gt;<i> back to symbiosis of trust. So far I see good results that warrant an
</I>&gt;<i> even stronger push to go back to the old ways. I would love to go into a
</I>&gt;<i> detailed analysis, but others have already done so many times over.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         There are bad apples, just don't let one bad apple ruin your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         relationship with the rest of the apples.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are bad apples, that we agree on.  The question is what to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about it.  Do we attempt to curb the bulk of content theft, or do we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simply force content creators to deal with a lack of protection for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their work?  If you were to poll the vast majority of content creators
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in Second Life what they would prefer...  no protection for their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work, or some protection... what do you think their response would be?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And let's face it...  as it stands... the majority of people who will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be designing content for a metaverse based on OpenSim will come from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Second Life.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's an interesting phenomenon in society. The more physical and
</I>&gt;<i> legal restriction you place on somethign the more people justify
</I>&gt;<i> breakign those restrictions.  We can look back at the Prohibition era
</I>&gt;<i> for a good example of this in action. More people drank under
</I>&gt;<i> Prohibition than before or after. Prohibition spurred heavy increases of
</I>&gt;<i> 40% to 60% in crimes that were already criminal before prohibition (and
</I>&gt;<i> after). When prohibition was lifted, these related crimes dropped back
</I>&gt;<i> to their pre-prohibition levels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a side note, to me, law serves as a guide of the collective belief in
</I>&gt;<i> what is right and wrong, not the other way around. You can't enact law
</I>&gt;<i> to change society. The creation and enforcement of DRM has had the exact
</I>&gt;<i> same result that Prohibition did. Both were enactments of law in order
</I>&gt;<i> to change social beliefs. Neither has suceeded because of the natural
</I>&gt;<i> order of law vs societal belief.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can understand that from a developers perspective, Intellectual
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Property Rights protection is a nasty bear to wrestle in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development of the metaverse, but I do not see how the metaverse
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project benefits from alienating the people who will make the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; metaverse interesting.  Think about it...  what would you have without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content?  Lots of empty space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Content can't come into being without a society. A society can't grow
</I>&gt;<i> and evolve without content. It's a symbiotic relationship that will
</I>&gt;<i> never cease to exist no matter how much restriction you place on art.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DRM and rights management pre-enforcement through fences does nothing
</I>&gt;<i> but destroy that symbiotic circle in my mind. You might get a brief
</I>&gt;<i> (brief in relation to all of history) surge of income and reward,
</I>&gt;<i> however this surge quickly reverts into loss of the fedback and becomes
</I>&gt;<i> self destructive. This is why I refer to DRM as the ultimate weapon of
</I>&gt;<i> mass destruction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe that the first metaverse platform to successfully solve the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IP Rights issue will end up on the top of the pile.  And with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concept that Charles and I were discussing here last night, I think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenSim could well be that platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *nod* The flexibility does allow us to try the different tactics to get
</I>&gt;<i> a comparable situation result. :) I have no problem at all with people
</I>&gt;<i> building DRM in so long as it is optional, and disabled by default. It's
</I>&gt;<i> up to each operator and content creator to choose how they interact with
</I>&gt;<i> the world. I just firmly believe that putting up electronic fences is a
</I>&gt;<i> self destructive act. I believe enough in self will that I detest these
</I>&gt;<i> anti-darwinism laws that prevent us as a society from choosing for
</I>&gt;<i> ourselves the level of protection vs fredom.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that eventually DRM and this whole idea of &quot;intellectual
</I>&gt;<i> ownership&quot; will fade away just as Prohibition has. Most places will go
</I>&gt;<i> for the open model because that is what society thrives on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few will retain the DRM model and will stay small isolated islands of
</I>&gt;<i> like minded individuals. They are most welcome to have this mini
</I>&gt;<i> society. I however will not be amongst them because I value the
</I>&gt;<i> creativity that art sparks in everyone when it is allowed to flow
</I>&gt;<i> freely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully I have done much better this go around than with my first in
</I>&gt;<i> clairity of ideas. ;-P I really should learn to speak after my brain is
</I>&gt;<i> more awake rather than right away.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aside from that, this has been a most enjoyable debate. :)
