The overall impairment created here is not by the licenses themselves, 
but it is a choice solely based on criteria for what patches to accept. 
This is not a license issue.

One thing I do notice is that some people insist that all contributed 
code to OpenSim be under BSD (along with not looking at SL source). 
Notice I did say some, but look at the subject line of this mail and how 
the thread started.

There have already been posts to the mail-lists to request a broadened 
open source nature in such a way that there is no bias to BSD or GPL. I 
agree that a move to Open Standards, being mentioned before, is more 
viable to achieve a broadened open source nature between the communities.

Side note: I also point out the example of Mozilla where it has several 
components and plug-ins all under different licenses, and I wonder why 
there is here a greater bias for a license scheme to make all 
contributions comply in such a way that it takes on the same license scheme.
