</I>&gt;<i> &gt; particular problems here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, the thing with the BlockingQueue is that it functions this way:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if something _Reads_ the queue, and it happens to be empty, the thread 
</I>&gt;<i> is BLOCKED until something else _Adds_ to the queue. Of course, if 
</I>&gt;<i> another thread comes along and reads from it, it is blocked as well, 
</I>&gt;<i> and all of them are released in one merry explosion when an item is 
</I>&gt;<i> Added. Which probably leads to all kinds of weird race conditions.
</I>That was my reading of it.  At least in the case of assets, there's only 
one thread which actually reads the blocking queue atm (AssetCacheThread).
&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (The PROBLEM with the BlockingQueue is that threads might LOCK
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; unknowingly because a sub-call felt like taking a peek at some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; blocking queue. Really really bad form.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could you be more specific? Looking at OpenSim.Framework.BlockingQueue,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can't see where deadlock could occur - none of the methods hold on to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the m_queueSync lock for long. However, I'm relatively new to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; synchronization in dot net, though I have done some in Java - I 
</I>&gt;<i> could be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; missing something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't mean deadlock as in ordinary lock{ } constructs, I mean the 
</I>&gt;<i> use of mutexes can cause a 'wrong' thread to lock by (coder) mistake. 
</I>&gt;<i> It's just a dumb effing construct to begin with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The BlockingQueue is used in the following contexts:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * Serving AssetRequests
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - This should be solved with a specialized ThreadStart queue that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; news up threads whenever something tries to add to it or if there's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; something in the queue, up to a specified max of concurrent requests.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Isn't starting up threads an expensive process? Perhaps a ThreadPool
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead if we wanted to go down that route?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes and No. Starting up threads is indeed 'expensive', but only in 
</I>&gt;<i> relation to how big the work item is. For example, when transferring 
</I>&gt;<i> an Asset, the cost of creating the thread is a fraction of the cost of 
</I>&gt;<i> actually transferring it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's exactly the over-excessive use of thread pools for long running 
</I>&gt;<i> work items that's exhausting the thread pool as it is right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thread pools should be used only when you KNOW the work item is a 
</I>&gt;<i> (relatively) small one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we WANT thread re-use for this special case depicted above, we can 
</I>&gt;<i> simply track and reuse the threads as they are finished.
</I>afair, at the moment the thread processing the asset BlockingQueue 
doesn't send the packets directly, but rather chops them up and places 
them on the on PacketQueue.  I don't know if this is expensive or not.
