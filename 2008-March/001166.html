<PRE>Yes,

the problem isn't using OpenSim and GPL:ed code together, the problem is introducing GPL:ed code in a BSD project; we do have the module system, which would let anyone, tainted or not, write GPL:ed code that would play very well with the core.

We would just not place that code and its dependencies in our BSD svn - you'd have to make it available say, on your own web site.

Also, as an alternative, we have been discussing setting up another repo (actually, another site completely) that holds non-core modules and extensions. That repo can very well be under mixed licenses.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aren't GPL compatible, like physx.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ummm... I should point out that which everyone forgets.  If the main

</I>&gt;<i> kinda like the module system that opensim currently has, that dotnet
</I>&gt;<i> has integrated and well-documented support for -- probably

</I>&gt;<i> taint.  There's also no requirement in that case for the GPL code to
</I>&gt;<i> have an FLOSS exception.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A friend of mine is using this to make use of the lzo.net library
</I>&gt;<i> without tainting his entire project, which he's keeping closed-source.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Also, there are two BSD licenses.  The first one, with the &quot;obnoxious
</I>&gt;<i> BSD advertising clause&quot;, is not GPL-compatible and thus requires the
</I>&gt;<i> FLOSS exemption in GPLed code.  The second, without that advertising
</I>&gt;<i> clause, does not require the exemption.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There has been talk about having code (say modules ) under say the LGPL, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it was decided that its easier to just have all the code in opensim svn
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; under BSD. That doesn't stop people creating modules that are under a LGPL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; license, just that at this time we aren't including such code in our svn.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So create a second svn that's specifically marked GPL, and do a weird
</I>&gt;<i> voodoo svn extern rite to make it so people can deal with it without
</I>&gt;<i> issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Meh.
