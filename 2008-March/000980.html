<PRE>ouch, my comment sounded a lot more judgmental than I intended. There's 
really nothing wrong with sex beds and gorean warlords :-)

As far as I know, there is no simulation environment that is both 
accurate in terms of physics modeling, and affordable and social at the 
same time. An environment like that would be a major enabler for lots of 
cool stuff -- the word used these day is &quot;transformative&quot;. I'm also 
thinking of special-purpose, not necessarily affordable, clients for it 
like the &quot;cave&quot; down at UCSD, a fully immersive 3D environment where you 
can physically move around the objects, using special goggles -- it's 
such an intense feeling! Just imagine the wonders that that would do for 
real world systems engineering! (ok, and for sexual and warlordy 
fantasies too, but you don't need good physics for those :-)

The sophisticated modeling tools used at NASA, Boeing, etc don't have 
the affordability and social parts. The ones that do -- and I know of 
early experiments there using Active Worlds -- aren't that accurate for 
the physics part. So we're talking about pushing the boundaries here, 
sci-fi stuff, really. It's not easy to do; it's not obvious at all how 
to do it, for the concrete reasons already mentioned.

The good thing about OpenSim and libsecondlife is that they're open 
source, so there's the opportunity to make side experiments that diverge 
from the main track, as long as there are motivated people to do it. I'm 
sure whatever is learnt in the process will be of enormous value, even 
if the actual code is thrown away and rewritten 1 year later so that the 
ideas can be merged. This process of experimentation is usually done in 
universities, but I see no reason for it not to happen in a project like 
this, with highly motivated, highly skilled part-time people. Those 
people just have to keep in mind that they're still experimenting, and 
not get frustrated that their code is not being integrated right away. 
So, a parallel project sounds really good!
