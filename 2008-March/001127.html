One of my rationales in assigning bugs to area experts (and figuring out
the area experts up front) is mean time to solved bug is much smaller.

Take 551 as an example.  That's been out there for weeks.  I didn't
realize it was still an issue because it seemed like a simple sqlite
thing and people must have tracked it down by now.  Once I finally
looked at the bug it was a simple issue of removing two .Close() calls
on the sqlite connection.

This was simple to me, as I'd spent a lot of time with that code and
knew why a lot of it was in there, and that the internal Open() /
Close() calls weren't used in the same way.  Had I not known that code,
I wouldn't realize that the root issue is we were manually closing the
db connection.

I also don't want people to feel they &quot;own&quot; portions of the code.  But
if it takes me 30 minutes to realize &quot;oh, yeh, easy fix&quot;, vs. letting
anyone solve it, and it not getting solved, I think we should err on the
easy fix side.

Anyway, area experts will be listed only if people are interested in
having their names on the list.  Not trying to force anyone into this,
just trying to help solving the easy problems. :)

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
