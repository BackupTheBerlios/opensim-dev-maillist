</I>I have observed problems where some clients keep requesting textures 
even though they should have received them.  This results in a 
constantly growing textures packet queue and when the client logs out, I 
believe some memory leak (probably because we're not releasing all the 
many references to IClientAPI) means this memory is not reclaimed.

Therefore, in r3933, we are now dropping texture requests if the client 
has already made 5 requests for that texture (1 request should be 
enough, since the client caches the data).  This will stymie any 
hypothetical client which relies on being able to re-request the same 
asset, but those clients are behaving badly anyway (they really should 
cache).

This treats the symptom rather than the cause.  I suspect there is some 
deeper underlying reason for the constant re-requesting, possibly 
connected with the interaction between OpenSim and the Linden client.  
However, this is a much harder problem to resolve.

Once osgrid gets to this revision, please let me know if the situation 
has improved, though I'll be peeking in to the logs anyway.

Regards,
