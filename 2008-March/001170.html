<PRE>Re: the comment below, the GPL addresses patents relative to code that is release under the GPL. That is, if a patent license is offered it must be without restriction (open to all) and free.  So I don't think patents are an issue either.



FWIW, IMO the same protection doesn't apply to network protocols.  So if the clever folks on the OpenSIM project reverse engineered the protocols involved between the viewer and the server back end and someone owns patented IP on the protocol then that might be an issue. Just commenting again on the assertion by some that &quot;open protocols&quot; make things all ok.  True if they truly are open but I personally haven't seen any statement to that effect.  Maybe if the team is looking for indemnification language that's the place to push... And stop worrying about who has seen such and so's code.



The only possible monkeywrench is patent infringement, but I don't

know if any patent filing has actually occurred on anything that

Linden's employees may have invented.  (I can't find any, but that

doesn't mean anything.)



My (non-lawyer, again) opinion?  Y'all need to lighten up.



-Kyle H



I'm also not a lawyer either, FWIW.



Mike
