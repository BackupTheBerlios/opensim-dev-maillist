Sorry Charles, I thought I was discussing this calmly.  I apologize if I
came across argumentatively, that was not my intent.  I sometimes sound more
intense than I intend to be in my writing.  I did not intend to make you
feel as though I was picking a fight.


&gt;<i> I am a bit sorry now that I agreed with you. But in any case, a server
</I>&gt;<i> could certainly have a way to keep its assets from being downloaded. Should
</I>&gt;<i> you wish such a closed environment, that is your perogative and is similar

</I>&gt;<i> buildings, perhaps shedding their clothes and wallets for new ones on the
</I>&gt;<i> way in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am not looking for a closed environment, so much as I am concerned about
Intellectual Property Rights.  A great many content creators will be just as
concerned when the metaverse concept begins to gain momentum in the more
mainstream circles.  I love the idea of a multiverse, but how does one
ensure their content does not get ripped off by some hack snooping through
locally stored assets?  I don't like the idea that content I create could
end up being stolen and resold/redistributed without license.


&gt;<i> You may, of course, submit patches to opensim and if they are accepted,
</I>&gt;<i> then you have influenced the course of our project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
When I am more familiar with the code, and have cleaned all the rust off my
coding skills, I just may.  But please do not disregard input into the
project simply because someone may not have high end programing skills.  As
a content creator, and an end user, my contributions to the concept of
practical application may be insightful.


&gt;<i> In any case, the metaverse, she are a changing and we must adapt in order
</I>&gt;<i> to move forward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Adaptation is the key to survival in the real world as well as the
virtual...  but change simply for the sake of change...  or for the sake of
saving time and effort.... can be more harmful than good.

Again, I do not mean to sound argumentative or offensive...  if that is how
this comes across... allow me to apologize in advance, that is not how it is
intended.
