<PRE>Actually, LL is well aware of our situation, and we are not alone in pressuring them for similar concessions. LL and OpenSim has always been on good terms and various OpenSim people are in discussions with various Linden people over various issues, including this.

For us, it's pretty clear; the lawyers and corporate advisors we've had at our disposal, have all agreed that we, to protect the integrity of the OpenSim core 100% , should take the threat of GPL taint very seriously. 

Even if it hasn't been proven in court, because nobody has had the money to run that lawsuit, doesn't mean it's not an issue.

This is NOT a declaration of mistrust, merely precaution. This project and it's license is worth way more than any single glance at incompatibly licensed software.

On a side note, I think we're better off not looking directly at somebody elses implementation; it gives us room for own creativity and preserves a sense of differing.

Best,
/Stefan

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It creates a situation where you can be accused to violating the GPL by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; trans-coding, intentionally or not, SL viewer code from GPL to BSD, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; open up a small community to a legal dark cloud.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Me personally, I'm not a big fan of that interpretation, but its one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; upheld by US court case law, risk-averse corporate lawyers for a major
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 3-letter computer company, and more importantly risk-averse OpenSim core
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; developers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If LL wanted to clarify the situation, they're welcome to draw up a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; covenant not to sue OpenSim or its developers over the matter. That's by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; far my favorite option.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What *exactly* would such a statement say?  Can you point me to an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example of any company who publishes GPL source code that has ever done 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything like this?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rob
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't think I can, since its a risk actually that all programmers at all
</I>&gt;<i> times face, whether it be from being accused of transgressing License A,
</I>&gt;<i> or copyright B, or patent C -- any and all IP -- especially in the US
</I>&gt;<i> where such things are taken very seriously.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What makes this case &quot;unique&quot; is that this is really an issue specific
</I>&gt;<i> to LL's relationship to OpenSim. OpenSim's core developers do not appear
</I>&gt;<i> to trust LL period. Therefore I suggest, Rob, that you and perhaps other
</I>&gt;<i> LL stakeholders might want to speak directly with them about this
</I>&gt;<i> specific issue, since I in no way represent OpenSim core developers (I'm
</I>&gt;<i> just relating what they told me).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As examples of past behavior that elicits concern, I believe the
</I>&gt;<i> examples of SCO (good turned evil) and mp3/Fraunhofer (ambiguous
</I>&gt;<i> assertion of IP rights) as situations OpenSim feels it should avoid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A number of large companies interesting in OpenSim have no doubt had
</I>&gt;<i> their lawyers influence this conservative stance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What something I would suggest might look like is: &quot;LL announces a
</I>&gt;<i> partnership with OpenSim for extending SL metaverse, including cross
</I>&gt;<i> licensing of IP rights, and a GPL exception for OpenSim's BSD&quot;. But
</I>&gt;<i> that's just off the top of my head. Surely LL lawyers could do better in
</I>&gt;<i> cooperation with OpenSim core devs (which I am not one).
