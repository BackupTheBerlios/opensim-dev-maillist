<PRE>Burnman,

I suggest if your so concerned about this, that you start developing a
Module that will let you do what you like, expecting others to do it for you
is probably unwise, if your so concerned about it, start contributing some
code that will address your concerns.   Beyond that at this point i don't
really know what to tell you except you will have to wait and see how it
pans out, OpenSIM isn't even really 50% complete yet and i say that loosely
because OpenSIM will be and ever expanding, ever changing application, with
no real end in site, chances are out of necessity someone will address your
issues at some point, but right now OpenSIM is not a production application,
and at this point rights are not the primary concern.  I personally think
that once OpenSIM moves into a more Beta/Production environment you will see
more people concerned with this issue and out of necessity be building
modules to address this issue,  but if this is something you desire before
then, the only thing i can say is start providing some patches. :D
