<PRE>Well I would certainly agree that a blocking queue should only be used 
where a blocking queue is appropriate. But given that proviso, then when 
it is used, the behavior we're talking about here is the correct one. If 
you want to be able to peek, the GetQueueArray method attempts to satsify 
that need. If you cactually want to take an element, if one is there, and 
return otherwise, then a non-blocking dequeue could be provided, but that 
would beg the question why it should be necessary to defeat the monitor's 
queuing mechanism in this way and it's use should be very carefully 
administered.

We could add a boolean to dequeue indicating whether or not the thread is 
willing to wait; but choosing which call to make has to remain the 
responsibility of the programmer. Choosing the wrong one is an error of 
design, not a fault in the notion of blocking queues.

If you want REALLY hard problems to debug, then incorporating mechanisms 
intended to accomodate programmer's mistakes is definitely the way to go.

Re: [Opensim-dev] BlockingQueue






This is all true. What CAN and HAVE happened, is that somebody not aware 
that a method calls a method that calls a method that reads from the 
Blocking Queue suddenly finds herself waiting for somebody else to put an 
item into the queue. This kind of thread interdependency can lead to VERY 
hard-to-debug scenarios.

Which, incidentally, gets even worse since it's only one thread that is 
released at a time.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] BlockingQueue


The BlockingQueue uses Monitor.Pulse which only releases ONE thread for 
execution. The others remain suspended. PulseAll is needed if you want to 
awaken all the waiting threads. So the race condition that you describe 
should not happen (if Mono corrcetly implements Monitor anway). 

The queue AND the lock are private to the BlockingQueue class, so the only 
unsynchronized mechanism for  examining the queue is GetQueueArray which 
returns a copy of the content. In principle It isn't possible for anyone 
to damage the queue. The lock cannot be obtained by anyone not using the 
proper BlockingQueue accessors.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Preparing for the bug-a-thon friday, I want us to come together on

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; we will write this out of the core; I think it will give us much

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For people relatively new to the project, could you give any 
</I>&gt;<i> examples of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; particular problems here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, the thing with the BlockingQueue is that it functions this way:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if something _Reads_ the queue, and it happens to be empty, the thread 
</I>&gt;<i> is BLOCKED until something else _Adds_ to the queue. Of course, if 
</I>&gt;<i> another thread comes along and reads from it, it is blocked as well, 
</I>&gt;<i> and all of them are released in one merry explosion when an item is 
</I>&gt;<i> Added. Which probably leads to all kinds of weird race conditions.
</I>That was my reading of it.  At least in the case of assets, there's only 
one thread which actually reads the blocking queue atm (AssetCacheThread).
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (The PROBLEM with the BlockingQueue is that threads might LOCK
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; unknowingly because a sub-call felt like taking a peek at some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; blocking queue. Really really bad form.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could you be more specific? Looking at 
</I>OpenSim.Framework.BlockingQueue,
&gt;<i> &gt; I can't see where deadlock could occur - none of the methods hold on 
</I>to
&gt;<i> &gt; the m_queueSync lock for long. However, I'm relatively new to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; synchronization in dot net, though I have done some in Java - I 
</I>&gt;<i> could be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; missing something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't mean deadlock as in ordinary lock{ } constructs, I mean the 
</I>&gt;<i> use of mutexes can cause a 'wrong' thread to lock by (coder) mistake. 
</I>&gt;<i> It's just a dumb effing construct to begin with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The BlockingQueue is used in the following contexts:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * Serving AssetRequests
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - This should be solved with a specialized ThreadStart queue that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; news up threads whenever something tries to add to it or if there's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; something in the queue, up to a specified max of concurrent 
</I>requests.
&gt;<i> &gt; Isn't starting up threads an expensive process? Perhaps a ThreadPool
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead if we wanted to go down that route?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes and No. Starting up threads is indeed 'expensive', but only in 
</I>&gt;<i> relation to how big the work item is. For example, when transferring 
</I>&gt;<i> an Asset, the cost of creating the thread is a fraction of the cost of 
</I>&gt;<i> actually transferring it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's exactly the over-excessive use of thread pools for long running 
</I>&gt;<i> work items that's exhausting the thread pool as it is right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thread pools should be used only when you KNOW the work item is a 
</I>&gt;<i> (relatively) small one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we WANT thread re-use for this special case depicted above, we can 
</I>&gt;<i> simply track and reuse the threads as they are finished.
</I>afair, at the moment the thread processing the asset BlockingQueue 
doesn't send the packets directly, but rather chops them up and places 
them on the on PacketQueue.  I don't know if this is expensive or not.
