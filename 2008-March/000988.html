<PRE>Dear Burnman:

Whoa, Pardner. If you want to pick a fight, please go somewhere else and come back when you have got it out of your system as we prefer to discuss things calmly in this newsgroup.

I am a bit sorry now that I agreed with you. But in any case, a server could certainly have a way to keep its assets from being downloaded. Should you wish such a closed environment, that is your perogative and is similar to the real-world notion that only certain folks might go into certain buildings, perhaps shedding their clothes and wallets for new ones on the way in.

You may, of course, submit patches to opensim and if they are accepted, then you have influenced the course of our project.

In any case, the metaverse, she are a changing and we must adapt in order to move forward.

Charles

In order to move forward with a metaverse, we will need to get to the point where a user indeed does carry his inventory along with him. Now, to address your point, there may be certain things that carry certain permissions that are kept on certain servers, but I suspect you will need to rethink your paradigm from the existing LL notion and modify it to consider a metaverse with a number of grids (or buildings) and users that move from one to the other much like we do in RL. That will mean that the notion of inventory will need to evolve to avoid your notions becoming extinct.





So in the development of a metaverse...  are you under the impression that all content created for use in such an environment should be completely free and open-sourced like OS is?  I ask this because with client side storage of assets, you are removing any protection content creators have that their content won't be duplicated and resold.  I don't know about you...  but I don't know that many content creators who have the resources to seek legal action against the number of people that will exploit local asset storage.


I, for one, will not be all that interested in developing quality content for a system which affords my work no protection.  I don't know that many people who currently create content for SL who would do so either.  It seems an awful waste of talent.


I will continue to test my grid and offer what I can in that realm, and offer my insights into end-user functionality... which should be a major focus in the development cycle, but I am not sure where the benefit is to a metaverse which will end up less secure for content creators... and their Intellectual Property... than the internet we have today.


No offense intended, just my take on things.
