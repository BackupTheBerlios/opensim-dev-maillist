<PRE>Terry,

regarding currency, see my post on <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Money">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Money</A>

A payment system only works if there is a trusted third party that ensures a 
safe money transfer.
This can be either a corporation (e.g. a bank) that runs a safe grid, or an 
e-currency provider (using https).

Subject: [Opensim-dev] Thoughts....


&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i> Please forgive me if this sounds a bit noobish.
</I>&gt;<i> I have recently become interested in the work here concerning the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim Project and as a longtime SL user I am intrigued at the
</I>&gt;<i> possibilities this project suggests.
</I>&gt;<i> With that said, I have a few questions to ask the group and would
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate your thoughts on these issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How hard would it be to make the VoiceChat, TextChat, friends list, and
</I>&gt;<i> inventory all be handled on the client's side?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If these tasks were handled on the client side then it would seem
</I>&gt;<i> possible to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Allow a user to carry inventory with them from world to world.
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously some worlds may not be compatible with the user's specific
</I>&gt;<i> inventory item, in this case the user would be unable to use the item in
</I>&gt;<i> that particular world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Allow users to monitor friends in other worlds via the friends list
</I>&gt;<i> and chat to a friend via voice or text in one world while they(the user)
</I>&gt;<i> is in yet another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;lack of currency&quot; issue always pops up during chats about OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> and I can't think of an easy way to implement this without following
</I>&gt;<i> some sort of standard such as PayPal, moneybookers, etc.  Many people
</I>&gt;<i> don't like using those services while others don't mind at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My thoughts on this are that most users of the OpenSim based grids are
</I>&gt;<i> already SL users, with this in mind.... wouldn't it be possible to use
</I>&gt;<i> some sort of background process to monitor and use the user's Second
</I>&gt;<i> Life money balance until another option is available?
</I>&gt;<i> Meaning that the balance in the viewer would be retrieved from the
</I>&gt;<i> user's Second Life account and whenever a user needs to pay another user
</I>&gt;<i> then the actual transaction would be handled by a background process
</I>&gt;<i> that communicates with SL.  Obviously this would cause problems if one
</I>&gt;<i> of the users were not an SL user, hence maybe there could be a
</I>&gt;<i> configuration utility in the client to allow the user to pay via SL,
</I>&gt;<i> PayPal, Moneybookers, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> With PayPal's IPN notification it would seem possible to implement their
</I>&gt;<i> service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I'm out of place by trying to &quot;SPARK&quot; conversation on these
</I>&gt;<i> issues, but it would seem that if a user could do these things it would
</I>&gt;<i> make the option of using an OpenSim world or grid just as appealing as
</I>&gt;<i> using the second life grid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please don't flame me, as I stated I am somewhat of an OpenSim noob and
</I>&gt;<i> I just wanted to hear some thoughts on these issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> -Terry
