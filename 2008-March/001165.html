<PRE>Ok.  I took a deep breath.  I watched the Obama speech, and that inspired me
to be brutally honest with myself, and note an objection to my own
impassioned argument.

While I think it's a completely bogus state of affairs, I can see one tiny
glimmer of logic in the &quot;you can't look at SL viewer and work on opensim&quot;
argument.  I have a counter-argument for my counter-argument, but that's
later.

Reading the GPL as carefully as I can (recalling IANAL), the phrase that
gives me pause is this:

&quot;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.&quot;

by &quot;everyone's free use&quot;, one could interpret it to mean that the *patent
rights* (not the copyright) must remain under the GPL.  So the perfect storm
scenario that our 'high-priced attorneys' may be considering is this:

* Programmer putzes around with GPL'd viewer

* Programmer works on opensim, but is very careful not to copy any code.  A
code review confirms that there is no obvious code-level contamination

* Linden Labs sues people because their *patent rights*, which were
implicitly released under GPL, have been indirectly incorporated into a
BSD-licensed project through Programmer's &quot;inevitable disclosure&quot;, residual
IP etc.

So the fear of big companies is not that the code will be copied, but that
the underlying IP will infect opensim.  They are applying the same logic
they would apply to the case of a programmer who worked at Linden Labs, had
the viewer never been released to the public.

I can't recall my counter-counter-argument at the moment, but I'm sure it
was brilliant.
