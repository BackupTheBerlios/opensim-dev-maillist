<PRE>Our Release process has been a bit haphazard.  Stephan found that the
current 0.5.1 releases don't build yesterday. :(

I recommend we make one person out of the core committers the OpenSim
Release Manager, and that we have the following light weight process for
a release.

 * If anyone feels we are at a stable point for a release, email here
   with the svn rev, and the fact that it looks good, and brief reason
   for a release (feature X is solid, physics is fixed for Y bug, it's
   been too long since a release, etc).
 * Release Manager sets the tag
 * Release Manager rolls releases (.zip and .tar.gz, there are nant
   targets which do this already)
 * Release Manager gets folks on IRC to test the releases, minimum on
   Windows 32bit .NET and Linux 32bit Mono.  Not everything needs to
   work, but it needs to be rev quality that people on OSGrid could run
   it (i.e. make sure it doesn't crash on boot, or scripts don't run, or
   something)
 * If all looks good, email is sent out to -dev and -users declaring a
   release, and wiki is updated.

I would recommend Charles to be our first release manager, as he is
nearly doing all of this for OSGrid today already, and his incredible
thoroughness has helped keep us all in check.

Comments?

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
