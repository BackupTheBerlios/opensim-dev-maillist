&gt;<i> Thank you, burnman. Apology accepted. Lets go on.

You are most welcome.  It's a failing of mine, that I miss how I am
presenting myself in writing sometimes.  I should put a disclaimer in my
signature.  :)


&gt;<i> In thinking about your original post, you present an idea which is
</I>&gt;<i> interesting. That is a OpenSim.ini setting to allow or disallow the
</I>&gt;<i> download of assets to the client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a number of use cases for OpenSim, some of which favor
</I>&gt;<i> downloading assets to the client and some of which do not. This would allow
</I>&gt;<i> the sim server operator, perhaps influenced by the grid operator to allow
</I>&gt;<i> (or disallow) assets to a client that can handle them. I like this idea. It
</I>&gt;<i> is consistent with our modular and configurable design and might help to
</I>&gt;<i> converge part of this asset controversy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Part of the issue is that some assets may be protected, and some may not. It
&gt;<i> depends on how the assets were acquired and what the license terms are. With
</I>&gt;<i> your idea taken to its logical conclusion, we can have both a world such as
</I>&gt;<i> you envision and a world such as others envision and both with the same sim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That would certainly solve many of the concerns which present themselves
when pondering the whole content IP protection thing.  It offers the ability
for those who wish to manage their IP distribution to do so with more
security, while providing the ability to offer local asset storage for a
variety of other uses.  I imagine a great deal of possibilities with local
asset storage which are currently difficult if not impossible without it.

Thank you for discussing this with me, I appreciate your thoughts on the
subject.
