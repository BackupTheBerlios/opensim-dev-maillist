&gt;<i>  Client-side asset storage (inventory, I assume) makes very little sense

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Inventory is what was referenced, that is correct.  I haven't read much
about realXtend yet, I've been super busy the last couple of weeks in my
normal day to day to stay as &quot;in the know&quot; as I would like.  :)

&gt;<i>   You can do copybot with any client, not just libsl.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I know, I was referencing copybot's origin which was the libsl project.

&gt;<i>  &quot;cute&quot; is how *I* put it when I want to say nice things about LL's
</I>&gt;<i> fantasy layer :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Gotchya  :)

&gt;<i>  It looks like you and I have very different perspectives on the use of
</I>&gt;<i> virtual worlds, the success of Linden Lab, and everything else. So let me
</I>&gt;<i> tell you what my corner of the world looks like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I> Ok  :)

&gt;<i>  In most communities that I am a member of, SL is seen in a very negative
</I>&gt;<i> light, almost reputation-damaging; tolerated, but certainly not &quot;serious&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> That particular use of virtual worlds &#8211; for sex, role playing, socializing,
</I>&gt;<i> branding, etc., which have been the major drivers of the SL economy (not
</I>&gt;<i> IP!, which has been an inconsequent buzz word, and I can tell you why, if
</I>&gt;<i> you ask) -- is something that I respect from a distance, but not really
</I>&gt;<i> interested in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Oh trust me... you and I see this in pretty much the same light, though I
wouldn't downplay the IP side of it too much.  The digi-lovers are just as
content intensive as everyone else.

&gt;<i> I did, however, see in it the potential for a general purpose immersive 3D
</I>&gt;<i> platform with which lots of other more interesting things can be done
</I>&gt;<i> (interesting for me, of course); things that have tangible consequences in
</I>&gt;<i> the real world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I agree wholeheartedly.  I read something not too long ago about 3D virtual
environments enabling people with severe disabilities to communicate in a
social environment more freely and without stigma.  And some of the things
IBM is doing with OpenSim look very interesting indeed.

&gt;<i> Who cares about the HUD-controlled penis when a) there's a physical one
</I>&gt;<i> around,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Still trying to figure this one out myself... I guess it takes all kinds...

&gt;<i> and b) you can actually plan the relocation of an entire real-world city
</I>&gt;<i> to a new location, and share the plan with its citizens in an immersive
</I>&gt;<i> manner? The real world is a lot more interesting to me; OpenSim can be a
</I>&gt;<i> powerful tool to improve it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I> I agree with you here as well.  I have been considering contacting the
historical society here to work out a virtual representation of the city in
historical context... such as the revolutionary war.  The use for
educational purposes alone is mind-blowing.

&gt;<i> The great thing about OpenSim is that it can be a lot of things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I can't argue with that.

Thank you for taking the time to discuss this with me, I've enjoyed your
points of view.  :)
