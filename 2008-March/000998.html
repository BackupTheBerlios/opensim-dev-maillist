</I>&gt;<i>     suspect you will need to rethink your paradigm from the existing
</I>&gt;<i>     LL notion and modify it to consider a metaverse with a number of
</I>&gt;<i>     grids (or buildings) and users that move from one to the other
</I>&gt;<i>     much like we do in RL. That will mean that the notion of inventory
</I>&gt;<i>     will need to evolve to avoid your notions becoming extinct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in the development of a metaverse...  are you under the impression 
</I>&gt;<i> that all content created for use in such an environment should be 
</I>&gt;<i> completely free and open-sourced like OS is?  I ask this because with 
</I>&gt;<i> client side storage of assets, you are removing any protection content 
</I>&gt;<i> creators have that their content won't be duplicated and resold.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't know about you...  but I don't know that many content creators 
</I>&gt;<i> who have the resources to seek legal action against the number of 
</I>&gt;<i> people that will exploit local asset storage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I, for one, will not be all that interested in developing quality 
</I>&gt;<i> content for a system which affords my work no protection.  I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> know that many people who currently create content for SL who would do 
</I>&gt;<i> so either.  It seems an awful waste of talent.
</I>not necessarily. remember you talking to folks who are in the process of 
creating the metaverse of the future --- and it's under a BSD style 
license. not even GPL. awful waste of talent? don't think so. rather an 
incredible demonstration of talent.

i can copy bootlegged MP3s...i choose not to and instead buy them. of 
course i expect a fair price (having to pay the same amount for an MP3 
album as for the CD when i foot the bill for the bandwith and storage 
and don't get the plastic and the content provider doesn't have to 
entertain a supply chain is not a fair price). give me a good user 
experience, give me good content at a fair price and i will buy anytime 
instead of copying (even though i could copy).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will continue to test my grid and offer what I can in that realm, 
</I>&gt;<i> and offer my insights into end-user functionality... which should be a 
</I>&gt;<i> major focus in the development cycle, but I am not sure where the 
</I>&gt;<i> benefit is to a metaverse which will end up less secure for content 
</I>&gt;<i> creators... and their Intellectual Property... than the internet we 
</I>&gt;<i> have today.
</I>i claim the metaverse will end up with will be as secure as the internet 
we have today --- today's internet is not secure in the sense you are 
assuming it to be.
