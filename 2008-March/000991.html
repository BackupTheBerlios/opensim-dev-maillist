<PRE>Hello Terry,

I am not sure what the best solution is, personally.  Linden Labs stores
assets server-side specifically for the purpose of Intellectual Propterty
Rights protection, which was originally one of the appeals it had for me.  I
was able to produce content which I own the IP for, and distribute it as I
saw fit.  If OpenSim is going to store assets locally, then that won't be an
option for end-users of OpenSim based grids, or it will only be available on
the grids which have branched off of the core OpenSim project, this negating
the point of interoperability... the core concept of the metaverse.

Encryption won't really work in this scenario, since OpenSim is
Open-Source.  The method of encryption, and thus the method of decryption,
would be available to anyone who wants it.
