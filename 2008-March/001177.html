Patent law is a tricky thing.  Patents can ONLY be granted to the
original inventor (and not even a company, it has to be a named
individual or individuals).  You cannot apply for a patent on
something that someone else came up with.

No, patent law prevents someone else from being able to patent your code base.

bunch of information on the topic, and I wholeheartedly suggest that
anyone who wants to participate in this discussion read it.
