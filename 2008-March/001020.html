Its moving about in fits and starts. 3Di needs this for its customers,
but with luck we will have at least an architecture that everyone can
hook into based solely on SIP... its very much as yet unclear, but we're
working on it.

With luck, and a user-provided Asterisk server (to host a SIP conference
bridge), I'd say you can replace vivox on a beta grid in a time frame
best measured in weeks not months. Sooner if someone decides to help.

Ill try and keep everyone updated.

Cheers,
