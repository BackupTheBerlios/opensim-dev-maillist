<PRE>Let me attempt to add some clarity.

First of all, we all know that regions do store certain things now, such as prims. In a grid environment, primarily textures are stored on a centralized asset server currently.

There is a move afoot by some to consider having the client store textures, prims and perhaps scripts.

Should this move gather momentum, we were only talking about an initialization switch that would allow a client so-equipped to either be allowed, or not be allowed to download certain types of data from the region or grid.

Admiteddly, it is an unfinished thought, and who knows if it will even survive the week, but nonetheless, thats the gist of it.

Charles

Sort of, yes.  Though that little issue would be relatively well taken care of with the idea of a setting in OpenSim.ini which allows the owner of a grid to toggle whether assets are stored server side or elsewhere.  Charles and I had discussed that the other day on this list.


I must say I am also a bit confused, where did you read and what makes you think that assets will be stored anywhere else beside server side at this point??  perhaps i have missed something, but right now the clients do not support client side asset storage, i do not recall anyone even talking about this option.
