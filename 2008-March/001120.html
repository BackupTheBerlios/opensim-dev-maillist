If we can avoid storing the database, because things regen on start,
it's on less thing to keep track of.

&gt;<i> &gt; I think we also need to build in a reaper at some point, which looks for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; references to assets in the system, and deletes those not referenced.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that there are two problems with reaping assets

</I>&gt;<i> 1)  Many LSL functions allow you to reference assets directly by UUID,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2)  In grid mode, currently disconnected regions may be references 
</I>&gt;<i> assets in their region stores.  Checking whether any of these reference 
</I>&gt;<i> an asset would be a difficult (if not effectively impossible) task.
</I>
It's going to be hard, but something that will need to be sorted out at
some point, otherwise you've got a massive denial of service attack of
just uploading textures until you fill up the grid server filesystem.
If you can never delete anything, ever, you'll blow all your storage at
some point.

The grid can easily cross reference with Inventory, as well as putting a
parser in for scripts looking for UUID like things.

Then there should be some way for regions to tell the grid all the
assets they are currently using (by looking at prims).

While I think the problem is hard, I don't think it is intractably hard.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
