<PRE>Google &quot;inevitable disclosure&quot;. This is the direction case law is heading towards, sadly.

Also both the BSD nor the GPL are &quot;truely open licenses&quot;, they are both free software and open source licenses. The only difference is that the GPL makes it illegal to strip GPL permissions or sublicense the code out. It's incompatible with BSD but usable in a &quot;Free World&quot; system. Also, if you want to complain about people taking BSD code into GPL projects, I would like to point out the large numbers of proprietary projects that take BSD code and don't give back, period. You get to either say &quot;use my code in any project with any license&quot; or &quot;use my code with my license attached&quot;, not &quot;use my code in any project with any license so long as that license doesn't forbid anyone from changing the license&quot;.

The reason why we don't look at the client code is simply because of fears of a possible lawsuit by Linden Labs or any other GPL contributor, again if you haven't Googled &quot;inevitable disclosure&quot; yet please do so. True it says nothing about this in the GPL or BSD licenses, but the courts can interpret them any way they choose. RealXtend is taking the same route with their modifications of our simulator and Linden's viewer, having separate developer teams that don't share anything but protocol specifications. And before someone says &quot;oh why not just use the GPL then&quot; we have practical reasons to use BSD, including the PhysX plugin which can't be GPL, and I believe we use some other BSD-licensed libraries like libsecondlife that we'd like to contribute patches back upstream if we could. So we're at this curious state where we can't practically do anything client-sided until the viewer project matures enough to be usable for day-to-day use on the Linden and
 OpenSim grids.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Violating the GPL by looking (Re: Voice Module)

Sorry but this is really specious.  I'd like see a cited example where anything remotely close to this was challenged and held up in court.  The GPL protects a physical implementation.  If I copy that implementation I'm in violation. In the GPL case especially the argument can be made that you *can* look at the code and see if what you did involves direct code copying.  If I re-implement ideas I *may* be in violation of a patent but then anything GPL'd can't be protected that way anywho and even then patents are supposed to describe an implementation so that's also questionable.

IBM may choose to be ultra-conservative because they have proprietary IP they wish to protect from GPL &quot;taint&quot;.  That doesn't make their practice best practice for everyone else.

The OpenSIM project selected IMHO a truly open license. This GPL nonsense comes up every so often and it's really a shame.  I applaud the team for licensing OpenSIM using a BSD license.  The GPL IMO obscures more than enlightens.  Licenses are a fact of life, shame but it's true.  The OpenSIM team picked a path that's probably the least complicated.  Let's not mess that up with indemnification bull for a license that shouldn't IMO apply to OpenSIM work anyway.

Mike

What *exactly* would such a statement say?  Can you point me to an example of any company who publishes GPL source code that has ever done anything like this?
