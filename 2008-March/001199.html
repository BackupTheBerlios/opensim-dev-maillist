</I>Hmm, it's hard to say.  I don't believe this is the problem, since it 
appears that some clients request endlessly while others do not.  UUIDs 
for which there is no associated texture can also get hit upon in the 
same way.

My personal blind guess at the moment is that this might have something 
to do with the avatar appearance texture problems that appear in some 
clients, such as mine on my T60 ThinkPad in Windows (where I'm always a 
completely black avatar).  There's a tantalizing sliver of evidence 
described in <A HREF="http://www.libsecondlife.org/wiki/AgentSetAppearance">http://www.libsecondlife.org/wiki/AgentSetAppearance</A> where 
one of the repeatedly requested non-existing textures 
(C228D1CF4B5D4BA884F4899A0796AA97) is apparantly &quot;a strange 
avatar-related texture&quot;.

However, if this is the issue the cause could be rather complicated, 
since I've heard that the black avatar problem might even being 
something to do with the client's graphics driver (though I personally 
don't know what complicated chain of causality would provoke this).
