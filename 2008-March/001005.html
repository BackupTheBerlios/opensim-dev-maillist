</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Noted.  ;)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Your arguments are spot on. :) I would add that having DRM or
</I>&gt;<i>     attempting
</I>&gt;<i>     to curtail end users fredom of use is pushing society to being
</I>&gt;<i>     untrustable. There is an old saying. Say something often enough and it
</I>&gt;<i>     becomes true. Say people WILL steal content at times, be paranoid
</I>&gt;<i>     about
</I>&gt;<i>     it and far more people WILL steal your content due to lack of
</I>&gt;<i>     respect ,
</I>&gt;<i>     which is earned by the creator's lack of trust in others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is no paranoia in the valid concern that people will attempt to 
</I>&gt;<i> rip you off.  It happens all the time.  It will never cease to amaze 
</I>&gt;<i> me how entitled people feel to other people's Intellectual Property.  
</I>&gt;<i> THAT is where the lack of respect and trust comes into play.  An 
</I>&gt;<i> artist or author who wishes to protect their work from those who are 
</I>&gt;<i> low enough to steal from them should not be looked on as paranoid, 
</I>&gt;<i> they are simply trying to enforce their rights under law.  Theft is 
</I>&gt;<i> where the lack of respect and trust come from.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     However if you as a creator can bring yourself to see the good in
</I>&gt;<i>     others, most will respect you enough to not steal your work. You will
</I>&gt;<i>     still have some minor theft happening, but not nearly enough to
</I>&gt;<i>     stop you
</I>&gt;<i>     from creating and profiting from your creations. This is just life and
</I>&gt;<i>     society in general and unavoidable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By your argument, we should do away with police and trust people to 
</I>&gt;<i> behave themselves.  Simply because it is impossible to prevent all 
</I>&gt;<i> theft, does not mean we should just give up in our attempts to make it 
</I>&gt;<i> difficult.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Here's another parallel to the whole DRM debate. We trust each
</I>&gt;<i>     other to
</I>&gt;<i>     not run around killing people. We don't walk around wearing 100%
</I>&gt;<i>     protective body armour because, well, it's impossibly expensive,
</I>&gt;<i>     and no
</I>&gt;<i>     one will trust you due to your obvious paranoia. ;) Instead, we walk
</I>&gt;<i>     around with no armour at all, yet the threat of serious bodily harm is
</I>&gt;<i>     still there, and we manage to survive just fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tell that to the two teenagers who were shot to death across town here 
</I>&gt;<i> last week.  They were in their driveway playing basketball.  Or the 
</I>&gt;<i> elderly man who was gunned down in his driveway a few towns away the 
</I>&gt;<i> week before that.  The danger is there, and it would certainly be far 
</I>&gt;<i> worse if there were no police to keep it relatively in check.  While 
</I>&gt;<i> there is no such thing as 100% safe, we are more safe due to the 
</I>&gt;<i> protections in place.  This analogy works just as well for asset 
</I>&gt;<i> protection in a metaverse environment.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     There are bad apples, just don't let one bad apple ruin your
</I>&gt;<i>     relationship with the rest of the apples.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are bad apples, that we agree on.  The question is what to do 
</I>&gt;<i> about it.  Do we attempt to curb the bulk of content theft, or do we 
</I>&gt;<i> simply force content creators to deal with a lack of protection for 
</I>&gt;<i> their work?  If you were to poll the vast majority of content creators 
</I>&gt;<i> in Second Life what they would prefer...  no protection for their 
</I>&gt;<i> work, or some protection... what do you think their response would 
</I>&gt;<i> be?  And let's face it...  as it stands... the majority of people who 
</I>&gt;<i> will be designing content for a metaverse based on OpenSim will come 
</I>&gt;<i> from Second Life.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can understand that from a developers perspective, Intellectual 
</I>&gt;<i> Property Rights protection is a nasty bear to wrestle in the 
</I>&gt;<i> development of the metaverse, but I do not see how the metaverse 
</I>&gt;<i> project benefits from alienating the people who will make the 
</I>&gt;<i> metaverse interesting.  Think about it...  what would you have without 
</I>&gt;<i> content?  Lots of empty space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that the first metaverse platform to successfully solve the 
</I>&gt;<i> IP Rights issue will end up on the top of the pile.  And with the 
</I>&gt;<i> concept that Charles and I were discussing here last night, I think 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim could well be that platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>my belief is that we can only resolve that via contracts between 
grid/sim operators and content creators. basically, we'll have open 
source content that will have BSD-style permissions or even GPL-style 
permission attached and we will have closed-source content where the 
content creator includes a list of trusted grid/sims (or grid/sims 
certification authorities) to which her content can be exported. all 
those sim/grids not on the list will not get the asset handed over from 
a &quot;trusted&quot; sim/grid.

that pretty much is all we can do, i think. the users will then decide 
what content they like, what content (and its restrictions) they don't 
like.
