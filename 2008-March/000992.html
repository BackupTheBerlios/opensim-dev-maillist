<PRE>Thank you, burnman. Apology accepted. Lets go on.

In thinking about your original post, you present an idea which is interesting. That is a OpenSim.ini setting to allow or disallow the download of assets to the client.

There are a number of use cases for OpenSim, some of which favor downloading assets to the client and some of which do not. This would allow the sim server operator, perhaps influenced by the grid operator to allow (or disallow) assets to a client that can handle them. I like this idea. It is consistent with our modular and configurable design and might help to converge part of this asset controversy.

Part of the issue is that some assets may be protected, and some may not. It depends on how the assets were acquired and what the license terms are. With your idea taken to its logical conclusion, we can have both a world such as you envision and a world such as others envision and both with the same sim.

Charles

Dear Burnman:

Whoa, Pardner. If you want to pick a fight, please go somewhere else and come back when you have got it out of your system as we prefer to discuss things calmly in this newsgroup.




Sorry Charles, I thought I was discussing this calmly.  I apologize if I came across argumentatively, that was not my intent.  I sometimes sound more intense than I intend to be in my writing.  I did not intend to make you feel as though I was picking a fight.

 

I am a bit sorry now that I agreed with you. But in any case, a server could certainly have a way to keep its assets from being downloaded. Should you wish such a closed environment, that is your perogative and is similar to the real-world notion that only certain folks might go into certain buildings, perhaps shedding their clothes and wallets for new ones on the way in.




I am not looking for a closed environment, so much as I am concerned about Intellectual Property Rights.  A great many content creators will be just as concerned when the metaverse concept begins to gain momentum in the more mainstream circles.  I love the idea of a multiverse, but how does one ensure their content does not get ripped off by some hack snooping through locally stored assets?  I don't like the idea that content I create could end up being stolen and resold/redistributed without license.

 

You may, of course, submit patches to opensim and if they are accepted, then you have influenced the course of our project.



When I am more familiar with the code, and have cleaned all the rust off my coding skills, I just may.  But please do not disregard input into the project simply because someone may not have high end programing skills.  As a content creator, and an end user, my contributions to the concept of practical application may be insightful.

 

In any case, the metaverse,
 she are a changing and we must adapt in order to move forward.





Adaptation is the key to survival in the real world as well as the virtual...  but change simply for the sake of change...  or for the sake of saving time and effort.... can be more harmful than good.


Again, I do not mean to sound argumentative or offensive...  if that is how this comes across... allow me to apologize in advance, that is not how it is intended.
