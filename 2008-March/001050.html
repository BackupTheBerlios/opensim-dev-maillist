On a more serious note:

I *do* respect the IP rights - and see the difference the &quot;community funding
on tips&quot; vs. the potentially &quot;commercial project&quot; can make in income in the
current society - it is enormous - I can tell that from the first hand
experience with the primskirtbuilder in SL. (It's just that I had other
reasons to do that thing  non-commercial, wanted to experiment, and  my own
integrity, reputation  and piece of mind is worth to me more than a 5-digit
dollar value. :-)

I might be in part faulty for the wrong impressions that some folks have got
from my blogging - purely because my enjoyment from the opensim - beyond
putting the small pieces of code very infrequently - is using the model it
provides for performing the mental experiments of how the world *could* be.
How the connected society *could* be. How the online money *could be*. How
the humans *could be*, in the end. Different. Apologies if anyone has
misunderstood those as a matter of &quot;Official OpenSim goals&quot;.

However, in my opinion, this is where the SL has not exploited its immense
potential - to be a place where the humanity can try the possible new
different ways of organizing itself. Without the people being shot and
loosing the homes. Without the countries' economies collapsing.

Some 10-ish years ago I was a witness of my country's currency value losing
2 digits (so for each of your 100 dollars you had only 1 after the exercise)
over a period of 1 week - and that was the *real* currency, not the linden
dollars. In a country with the population of over 100 million.
I know people who were saving to buy a house, and ended up with an amount
barely enough to live till the end of the month.

And I've witnessed the only savings that a lot of naive old people have put
into a ponzi scheme advertized on national TV, vanish, as that ponzi scheme
collapsed - and the organizer was never publicly prosecuted.

And I've seen the folks from the street being beaten up by the &quot;national
guards&quot; because they did not like how they their faces looked like.

Making my own mental experiments about how the world could look like - this
is what &quot;My world, my imagination&quot; translates into - for me personally, that
is.

This mail does not represent any &quot;official opensim&quot; point of view nor
attempts to diminish the content creators in SL - it just an explanation of
why I think the way I think, rather than just giving the impression of
merely a &quot;communist tekkie&quot;. :-)
