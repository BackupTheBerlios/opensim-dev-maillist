<PRE>This is not a winner or looser situation at all. Each organization makes decisions as appropriate. Our decision is a BSD license. Once that decision has been made, other decisions follow logically, one after another.

We would welcome support and contributions of code as long as they fit within the structure set up.

Charles

</I>We are able to interact (and already do) - it's just that we can't use 
the viewer source code for various miscellaneous reasons such as filling 
in missing protocol documentation from Linden (for instance, with the 
recent caps inventory changes, which I believe MW had to work out by 
inspecting the messages directly).

Thus, there's no need for there to be a loser - with open protocols 
(which is where I believe we're going) there are merely different 
implementations, even if one were to become dominant.
