That is the assumption made for GPLv2. With the GPLv3, it's just the 
proprietary third party libraries that are of concern. I don't see how 
any of those would prevent the production open standards for virtual 
world interoperability.

There is software that has existed before even OpenSim was made. All 
that software is being thought as completely useless to OpenSim if it is 
not LGPL with such criteria for inclusion. Maybe, just a suggestion to 
make it more clear, that it is a &quot;criteria for the repository&quot; and not 
something where you can't look at GPL code. Such things send out mixed 
messages and a bit of confusion. It is certainly possible to create 
another repository and mix GPL and BSD code together. It is not always 
possible, and probably not practical, to expect older software to 
completely change licenses just to be included in OpenSim's svn repository.
