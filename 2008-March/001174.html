<PRE>So. Does this mean if someone starts pasting GPL code of OpenSim code
into our mailing list, we could all be tainted! Oh no! Burn out your
eyes =o

int main() {

Note: This code was not from OpenSim. Or was it?  I don't know.  What
I do know is fear mongering is the not the way to make the world
better.

</I>&gt;<i> About my comment about 'inevitable disclosure', it was a bad attempt to make

</I>&gt;<i> might hold up in court that our code was GPL tainted because we had a chance
</I>&gt;<i> to look at their code and copy it, violating the GPL's requirements that all
</I>&gt;<i> code it covers must stay GPL. However, after reading comments on the mailing
</I>&gt;<i> list and some self-reflection I've realized something interesting... you
</I>&gt;<i> can't copy code from the Linden viewer into the server anyway! The Linden
</I>&gt;<i> viewer is C++ and the OpenSIM codebase is C#. Not to mention, the only thing
</I>&gt;<i> that would be of interest to our project in the Linden viewer would be
</I>&gt;<i> network packet handlers. Plus, copyright covers implementations, not ideas.
</I>&gt;<i> Dan Miller's final comment, however, is very true: There's no way to prove
</I>&gt;<i> that we didn't look at the code, especially since the code download can be
</I>&gt;<i> anonymous, routed through tor straight to a hidden truecrypt volume.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the whole &quot;linden might have a patent&quot; thing, that has nothing to do
</I>&gt;<i> with any allegations of GPL taint. If Linden has a patent they can use
</I>&gt;<i> against us, it harms us irregardless of GPL taint. The viewer is licensed
</I>&gt;<i> GPLv2 anyway, which doesn't have any patent-grant language. I wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> expect Linden to actually sue over such patents, given that they are aiming
</I>&gt;<i> for a completely open grid. Nevertheless we should be wary of any such
</I>&gt;<i> patents and avoid them if at all possible.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What it boils down to, though?  This discussion is simply more fear,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; uncertainty, and doubt thrown at the viability of the GPL for anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Absolutely.  It's FUD, and FUD is causing self-censorship -- that's why
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sticks in my craw.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The only possible monkeywrench is patent infringement, but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; know if any patent filing has actually occurred on anything that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Linden's employees may have invented.  (I can't find any, but that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; doesn't mean anything.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's exactly why a big-company attorney would give this sort of advice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We can't know if there are any Linden patent filings out there, or what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Linden's stance might be.  Therefore, the big companies who are interested
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in opensim (I have no doubt that an opinion from one of their overpaid
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hacks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is the genesis of this 'rule') are taking an absurdly cautionary stance by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; insisting that no opensim programmers can ever be exposed to the SL viewer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is patently ridiculous (ha!) about all this is, the problem could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exist if Linden released their viewer under a BSD license.  They could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have a patent; they could still claim 'residual information' or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'inevitable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disclosure' with respect to programmers who confess to having read said
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code.    The reason GPL rears its ugly head is that it explicitly states
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that you can't let your patents restrict other's GPL rights.  Note however
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that letting some of these patent rights slip into a BSD project *does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; restrict anyone's right to use the GPL code, nor does it go afowl of GPL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because there is no code copying!  (I shoulda been a lawyer..)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What makes it triply ridiculous is that a lawsuit could easily transpire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anyway, with a claim that some programmer is lying about having read the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code.  Inevitable Disclosure involves trade secrets and confidentiality
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agreements, where it is clear who had access and who didn't.  Having
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; programmers (whose r/l identities we often don't even know) pledge on IRC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; email that they never looked at code that is right out there for anyone to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anonymously download, is very unlikely to hold up in a court case.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So the whole thing remains... just silly, IMSHO.
