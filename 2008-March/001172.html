&gt;<i> &gt; What it boils down to, though?  This discussion is simply more fear,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uncertainty, and doubt thrown at the viability of the GPL for anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Absolutely.  It's FUD, and FUD is causing self-censorship -- that's why
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> sticks in my craw.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only possible monkeywrench is patent infringement, but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know if any patent filing has actually occurred on anything that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Linden's employees may have invented.  (I can't find any, but that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't mean anything.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's exactly why a big-company attorney would give this sort of advice. 
</I>&gt;<i> We can't know if there are any Linden patent filings out there, or what
</I>&gt;<i> Linden's stance might be.  Therefore, the big companies who are interested
</I>&gt;<i> in opensim (I have no doubt that an opinion from one of their overpaid
</I>&gt;<i> hacks
</I>&gt;<i> is the genesis of this 'rule') are taking an absurdly cautionary stance by
</I>&gt;<i> insisting that no opensim programmers can ever be exposed to the SL viewer
</I>&gt;<i> source.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is patently ridiculous (ha!) about all this is, the problem could
</I>&gt;<i> still
</I>&gt;<i> exist if Linden released their viewer under a BSD license.  They could
</I>&gt;<i> still
</I>&gt;<i> have a patent; they could still claim 'residual information' or
</I>&gt;<i> 'inevitable
</I>&gt;<i> disclosure' with respect to programmers who confess to having read said
</I>&gt;<i> code.    The reason GPL rears its ugly head is that it explicitly states
</I>&gt;<i> that you can't let your patents restrict other's GPL rights.  Note however
</I>&gt;<i> that letting some of these patent rights slip into a BSD project *does
</I>&gt;<i> not*
</I>&gt;<i> restrict anyone's right to use the GPL code, nor does it go afowl of GPL
</I>&gt;<i> because there is no code copying!  (I shoulda been a lawyer..)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What makes it triply ridiculous is that a lawsuit could easily transpire
</I>&gt;<i> anyway, with a claim that some programmer is lying about having read the
</I>&gt;<i> code.  Inevitable Disclosure involves trade secrets and confidentiality
</I>&gt;<i> agreements, where it is clear who had access and who didn't.  Having
</I>&gt;<i> programmers (whose r/l identities we often don't even know) pledge on IRC
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> email that they never looked at code that is right out there for anyone to
</I>&gt;<i> anonymously download, is very unlikely to hold up in a court case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the whole thing remains... just silly, IMSHO.
