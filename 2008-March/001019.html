<PRE>I am coming into this thread/opensim-dev mailing list late, but let me 
see if I can recap what I'm hearing.

A group of guys gets together to put hours and hours of their talent and 
energy over weeks, months and perhaps years to create something truly 
amazing even at a point of being only half done, (OpenSim). They give it 
away to anyone who wants it for free, with all rights to do as you wish, 
just mention their name when you use it. They even find others willing 
to give away free bandwidth for testing and sharing the development, 
(servers hosting the SVN repository). Others take that totally awesome 
and still free product, (OpenSim), and use it to provide a free service 
for anyone who cares to sign up, (OSGrid, DeepGrid, etc. etc).  This 
group of guys even provides free support via email and IRC to those 
having trouble getting installed or connected. They even listen to and 
consider working ideas that they may not agree with into their software, 
all for free.

Ummm, wait.... what was the question again?... How do we take a 512x512 
tga shirt texture and protect it from being stolen? I guess I'm missing 
the point here.
