<PRE>I've paused working on the Instant message system to investigate in greater
detail what would be entailed in using XMPP to transmit online presence
data, one to one instant messages, and one to many instant messages and I've
essentially gotten that none of the specs or drafts really take advantage of
the inherent scalability of grid computing.

Lets start with the pitfalls of the approved XMPP Spec
*Requires constant TCP streams
*Requires a central server.
*To add more load capability, you add another central server. Each central
server is allocated by domain in DNS.

In large scale applications, I think it's clear that constant TCP streams
are not the way to go.  And IMHO polling isn't either.
So that leads us to one of the Drafts of the XMPP spec

XMPP over BOSH(Bidirectional-streams over synchronous HTTP)

However, this spec only defines the possibility of having a HTTP Gateway,
which translates to open TCP streams.  So, once again, we end up with open
TCP streams. Essentially the Region Host would have the open TCP stream to
the XMPP server.   Once again, this is limiting to growth.  Given that low
use TCP servers struggle to handle &gt;=5,000 connections.   That essentially
limits your XMPP server to 5,000 regions or less.    Probably less given
that there could be up to N users in a region..   which would turn it from a
low use connection, to a high use connection.

Therefore, at least in my opinion, none of the barrage of XMPP specs are not
suitable for this application in general use.

However.    I'd like to note that if each Instant Message has a region
domain associated with it and the regions are responsible for connecting to
other regions to deliver instant messages then we get massive scalability
automatically.   In addition, to provide outside interoperability with XMPP
servers, a XMPP module could be built to communicate with the outside world
using XMPP.   The 'region domain' on the Instant message could lead to the
XMPP over BOSH gateway for people who have chosen to connect to IM only
applications.    The user would have the XMPP Gateway as the 'region that
the Instant Message Module' thinks they are at.

In this example, substitute User Server with whatever server you've got set
up to handle it.  Such as the Message Server..   Grid Server.. etc.

To put the Presence/IM flow into perspective:
1. User A - logged into a region
User B - logged into a region
User C - logged into a region
User D - logged into a connected Jabber server

2.   User A is friends with User B
User C is Friends with User A
User A is friends with User D
Therefore by the transitive
User B is friends with User A and User A is friends with User C by the
transitive.
However, User B and User C are not friends with each other

3. User A, B, C, and D are part of a Group

 (for our purposes lets say the friend list is a representation of a
presence subscription list that automatically gets subscribed to on both
sides, presuming that the friendship rules say that User X has given User Y
permission to see them online and User Y has given User X permission to see
them online)

   1. User A signs on.
      1. The User server determines that nobody is online in User A's
      friendlist to notify
      2. end.
   2. User B signs on.
      1. The User server determines that User A is connected and that
      User B is in a region/simulator
      2. User Server sends a notice through the simulator that they
      are in that A is online to User B
      3. User Server sends a notice through the simulator that they
      are in that B is online to User A
      4. end
   3. User C signs on.
      1. The User server determines that User A is connected and that
      User C is in a region/simulator
      2. User server sends a notice through the simulator that they
      are in that A is online to User C
      3. Users Server sends a notice through the simulator that they
      are in that C is online to A
      4. end
   4. User D signs on the jabber server.
      1. The jabber server notifies the user server through XMPP over
      BOSH, or parhaps straight XMPP
      2. The user server translates the friend list to &lt;iq&gt; stanzas
      3. The jabber server sends the subscription requests, which get
      translated into presence requests on the User Server
      4. The user server notes that User A is online and in a region
      5. User Server sends a notice to User A that User D is online.
      6. User Server sends a Presence stanza to the XMPP server
      regarding User A's Online status
      7. User Server sends a notice to the region that User A is in
      about User D's status
      8. Region Server notifies User A
      9. end
   5. At this point we have A, B, C and D Online, and all users have
   properly updated presence.
   6. User A signs off.
      1. User server determines that User B, C, and D are on User A's
      friend list
      2. User Server sends the simulator that has the open connection
      with User B the notice that User A logged off
         1. Region server informs User B
      3. User Server sends the simulator that has the open connection
      with User C the notice that User A logged off
         1. Region server informs User C
      4. User server sends a presence stanza to the XMPP
      server/Gateway to notify User D
      5. end
   7. A this point we have User B, C and D online all with properly
   updated presence
   8. User A signs on again
      1. User server sends a notice to the simulator B, and C are in
      with presence notifications
      2. User server sends a presence stanza to the XMPP server/Gatway
      with the proper session ID
      3. end
   9. User A sends a message to User B.
      1. User A's Region either knows where User B is or looks up the
      information from the User Server
      2. User A's Region connects directly with User B's Region and
      delivers the message to User B's region.
      3. User B's Region delivers the message to User B and caches the
      location and information of User A's Region
      4. end - Message Delivered
   10. User A sends a message to User D.
      1. User A's region knows where User D is (the Jabber server/XMPP
      Gateway).
      2. User A's region connects directly with the JabberServer/XMPP
      Gateway and delivers the message stanza caches the user's location.
      3. end - Message Delivered
   11. User D sends a message to User A
      1. The Jabber Server/XMPP Gateway over BOSH sends a HTTP Request
      to the region the user is in and sends a message stanza.
      2. User A's Region notifies User A.
      3. end - Message Delivered
   12. User B opens up a Group session with User A, C and D
      1. The User Server establishes a forwarding session with three
      regions and the XMPP Server
      2. The User Server establishes a group session with the XMPP
      Server.
      3. The XMPP Server informs the XMPP Client (User D) that there's
      a group session starting.
      4. Message from User B gets delivered to User A's Region and
      User C's Region.
      5. A Message Stanza gets sent to the XMPP Server with the group
      session ID from the User Server.
   13. User D sends a message in the group session
      1. The Message gets sent to the appropriate users on the XMPP
      Server and gets sent to the User Server.
      2. The User Server sends the message to User A, B and C's
      Regions.
      3. The Regions delivers the message to the users.
      4. end


Assumptions:

   1. Regions can contact each other's HTTP port and Regions can contact
   the Jabber Server/XMPP Gateway over BOSH.
   2. Card based group sessions are just dynamic group sessions.   Other
   then their dynamic nature, they function exactly the same as a session
   established by a pre-existing group.
   3. Eventually Group sessions will time out if there's no activity.
   4. The user server either periodially notifies subscribed user
   A's regions about which region User B is in.  Presumably in border
   crossings, etc, or this is looked up per instant message


:<i>D  A little more complicated then it looks at first hmm?
