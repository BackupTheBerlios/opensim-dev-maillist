<PRE>This is interesting burnman. As I think about it, there will come a time when certain things are most appropriate to hold on the client side. Things such as clothes, tools, wallets, cellphones.

As we move forward and to draw a real-world analogy. It is appropriate for me to keep my clothes, wallet and celephone in my home and not to get new clothes for each building I enter during the business day.

In order to move forward with a metaverse, we will need to get to the point where a user indeed does carry his inventory along with him. Now, to address your point, there may be certain things that carry certain permissions that are kept on certain servers, but I suspect you will need to rethink your paradigm from the existing LL notion and modify it to consider a metaverse with a number of grids (or buildings) and users that move from one to the other much like we do in RL. That will mean that the notion of inventory will need to evolve to avoid your notions becoming extinct.

So, to answer both of you, I suspect we will end up heading in that direction.

One the currency part, Terry. There is nothing to stop you  from making a deal with anyone right now on any OpenSim grid. In fact, I have already purchased items on OSGrid from content creators by paying them on the maingrid. It is a painless act. So, by all means, go ahead.

Hello Terry,

My concerns are with what I have quoted below.  As a content creator, I am concerned with the lack of Intellectual Property rights protection which client side inventory would pose.  Why bother to create content if it is going to get stolen and redistributed?  You will see a lot less in the way of quality content, since many people use their content creations as a source of revenue.

I am not sure how the developers feel about this, but as someone who relies on the ability to set permissions to protect my IP, I would not like to see client side inventory asset storage.  Now, if the option to restrict content to remain on the server and NOT be stored locally were available, that would be fine with me.  That would allow content creators to decide for themselves how their content is distributed.  Of course, items flagged as server side only would not be able to move from grid to grid.

It's an interesting problem to solve.

How hard would it be to make the VoiceChat, TextChat, friends list, and
inventory all be handled on the client's side?

If these tasks were handled on the client side then it would seem
possible to:

1. Allow a user to carry inventory with them from world to world.
Obviously some worlds may not be compatible with the user's specific
inventory item, in this case the user would be unable to use the item in
that particular world.
