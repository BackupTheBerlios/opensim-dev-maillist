</I>&gt;<i> played the commercial game long enough to build a little nest-egg..)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There will also be corporate media moguls, Britney Spears, and things like

</I>&gt;<i> the commercial side.  I believe there is a place for some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> permissions system; I'm just technically savvy enough to know that it is
</I>&gt;<i> unenforceable in the long term.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not one of those anti-DRM zealots who believes that it is morally
</I>&gt;<i> wrong
</I>&gt;<i> to try to sell media with protection.  I believe strongly in IP (except
</I>&gt;<i> where it's protected by bullshit laws enacted by lobbyists that don't
</I>&gt;<i> accept
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable fair use rights and perpetuate never-ending protection).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If an artist chooses to try to sell you his/her work in some DRM'd form
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> you dislike, I say you reject that artist's work.  Let the marketplace
</I>&gt;<i> decide.  Stick to content creators whose philosophy is sympatico with your
</I>&gt;<i> own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I come down on the side of letting the technology support DRM,
</I>&gt;<i> permissions, watermarks and anything anyone can think of and implement
</I>&gt;<i> sanely.  But none of this will matter unless we foster a culture of trust
</I>&gt;<i> between producers and consumers of media.  We're getting to a point where
</I>&gt;<i> potentially every consumer is also at least a micro-producer (mix tapes
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> your friends?)  The old model of huge, monolithic information source and
</I>&gt;<i> millions of mindless couch potatoes is going out the window -- and this
</I>&gt;<i> medium is helping that along (Avatars are representations of each
</I>&gt;<i> individual's expression -- and are therefore a production!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Think of the bright side: we are developing what is arguably going to be a
</I>&gt;<i> medium with the potential to subsume all that came before it.  We have a
</I>&gt;<i> chance to 'do it right'.  I don't mean technically -- I mean culturally.
</I>&gt;<i> Free-the-bits types have to realize that commercial, market-driven
</I>&gt;<i> business
</I>&gt;<i> is essential to success.  My-bits-are-mine types have to realize that some
</I>&gt;<i> people will not accept being treated like potential criminals.  Why can't
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> all just get along?
