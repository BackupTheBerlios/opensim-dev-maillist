<PRE>The protocol between the sim and the viewer allows for clients to initiate
and stop animation sequences. There are packets defined for it, and I
believe they are the basis for &quot;client side animation overriders&quot; that are
a feature of many third-party viewers. You should be able to modify a
viewer to send these packets at will and your avatar should respond as soon
as the sim is able to relay the packet, provided the sequence you specified
has been downloaded and cached by the viewer. Otherwise there will be a
short delay while the viewer requests and downloads the sequence.

Other possibilities exist also: a LSL script in an attachment worn by the
avatar can control the animations played by that avatar, and could also use
repeating long-poll http queries to your computer where the kinect box is
connected to receive animation commands and then tell the avatar to play
them. Another means may be to have a plug-in packet injector for the
GridProxy program that comes with libomv  <A HREF="http://openmetaverse.org/">http://openmetaverse.org/</A>  which
could either send animation packets, or send chat commands to a script worn
by the avatar which could then start animations.

Any of these solutions should work for either SL or unmodified OpenSim
installations. None of them are probably considered &quot;production quality&quot;
but they could get you to the point where you have a reasonably functional
solution.

&gt;<i>  Hello developers of OpenSim!****

</I>&gt;<i> Short description of what my aim is:****
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am working on a application that is able to recognize gestures from a

</I>&gt;<i> appropriate animations for the gestures.****
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question:****
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does OpenSim has a suitable interface that my application can use to tell
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim it has recognized a certain gesture and thus controlling the avatar
</I>&gt;<i> to perform the appropriate animation from the database?****
