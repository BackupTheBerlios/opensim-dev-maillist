<PRE>Option #4: Seperate them.

Use a permissions/ACL groups system on the sim which is separate from
the grid ones.

Then use the grid ones as simple communication / interaction groups.

There's two different tasks here as far as I can see - so cramming them
together to match what the viewer does may not be the optimal solution
(there's nothing stopping you from having the viewer action affect both
however)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> in chat, an interesting question was raised, concerning the scoping
</I>&gt;<i> of groups.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It appears that groups really serve a dual purpose, as a
</I>&gt;<i> communications platform and as a permissions system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the role of permissions administration, groups are tied to land,
</I>&gt;<i> which scopes them at grid level, most likely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the other role, as comms medium, they are user-tied, you would
</I>&gt;<i> want to take IM/Notices with you if you teleport intergrid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A few possible solutions come to mind, none is 100%:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Scope groups at grid level: Allows consistent land
</I>&gt;<i> ownerships/permissions, but group chat would be grid-local
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Scope groups at user level: You could take all your groups with you
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere, but permissions become tricky.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A combination, where the groups from your current grid and those
</I>&gt;<i> from your userserver are merged and form the group list on the grid
</I>&gt;<i> you are on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There may be options to scope all groups at user level, and let them
</I>&gt;<i> own land anywhere, but that would put a certain amount of trust into
</I>&gt;<i> a UUID that is not locally manager, and I would hesitate to do that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I write this, another option comes to mind.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If groups were scoped with the user, then each grid could create a
</I>&gt;<i> record that maps that group (by name) to a local ID, which could
</I>&gt;<i> then own land.
</I>&gt;<i> This might yet give the option of implementing groups that can have
</I>&gt;<i> both functions in one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thought are appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Melanie
