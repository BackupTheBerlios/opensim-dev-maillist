<PRE>I basically mean case 2, case 1 is good, but foreign user approach doesn't fit every use case. For instance some grids/regions might want to be &quot;walled grids&quot;. But that doesn't mean a user shouldn't be able to bring his inventory and assets if they want (and the grid allows). So we need to support a user registering multiple accounts but using a single inventory set (not different sets for each account). 
 
 But as well as registering multiple accounts, there are other use cases that require the multiple user server/grids accessing a single inventory set. We (tribalnet) have such a system, in that there is a global grid mode, but also a private build mode. build mode is basically a adapted standalone region with its own user server. But each user has the same userid on it as in the global grid. Both modes also share the same asset and inventory servers. So anything you upload/ or create in build mode will be avaliable when you login to the grid.

I see it as a requirement that this sort of thing isn't broke. We should always think that different people have different use cases. And have to allow them. Certainly if its possible now, then we shouldn't do changes that break it.

this depends on what exactly &quot;change grid&quot; means:

1. if it means user registers at GridService1 and want to login to a regionserver at GridService2, THEN
 That is my point, and I think that is the point maybe I did described clearly:
just for &quot;grid jump&quot;, *** user need not to change its grids(here means userserver_url)***
user can only register in one gridservice(userserver), and he can keep its account there forever, and the user still can travel to other gridservices.
 [avatar portability mechanism:]
because when the an user login to a &quot;foreign region&quot; in other gridservice
* the user tells the &quot;foreign region&quot; to claim its identity from its original userserver.
 * the user tells the &quot;foreign region&quot; to bring its belongings into the world(appearance, inventory).
In this case &quot;userserver_dictionary&quot; *need not to be updated*

2. if it means: user register another account at another gridservice. like today I have been using hotmail, and now I am using gmail. THEN
 * if the user cares about his/her belongings, by using the portability mechanism I methioned in 1, the user can still use his/her previous
  inventory/asset service, because inventory/asset server are independent., in this case, yes, &quot;userserver_dictionary&quot; *need to be updated*,
   (to set userserver_url point to current userservice) but this kind of &quot;change&quot; won't be frequent, like today, how many free mail accounts
  are you &quot;really&quot; using, or how many times you changes your mail account ?
 * if the user want to start a new life, maybe he/she does not mind start from &quot;zero&quot;, like today I switch to gmail, I can not read my past
   mails in hotmail in gmail. why I change to gmail? because my hotmail is full with spam, I donot want to clean it.

 Well no, as each user should have a inventory server url in their userprofile db. So that is looked up and the login server then asks for permission on the inventory server to access a users inventory and to push the session id. So yes you need to set up permissions on the inventory server to allow the various &quot;grids&quot; to access a users inventory. 
 
But as there could be multiple grids authorised for a user, it allows the user to login and out of those grids while keeping the same inventory. If you have a userserver url in some db in the inventory server, then this needs updating when a user changes grids (or if multiple urls were saved, then the active one needs setting). And it certainly shouldn't have to be done manually so again it requires a push.

  Comparing &quot;pull&quot; and  &quot;push&quot;, I would like to say:
pull is &quot;require setting a lot of urls on different servers anyway&quot;, but push is full with vulnerability.
