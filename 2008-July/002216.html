<PRE>Hi,

I was in a bit of a hurry sending that first email so I missed out a
few details.

All the code in the Tools/ subfolder is written by Malcolm Crowe[1].
That code generates three files needed by the compiler: lg.exe, pg.exe
and Tools.dll.

lg.exe and pg.exe are the lexer and parser generators, respectively.
They turn the .lexer and .parser files into C# code that, along with my
code, is compiled into the compiler. Tools.dll is referenced by the
compiler (using Tools;).

So technically these three binaries don't have to be rebuilt every
time, and I don't foresee any changes being made to those source files.
The binaries could be shipped in the bin/ directory in trunk, like
so many other .dll files there already.

I will get in touch with the original author though and ask his
permission to include any of this in OpenSim.

They are all in the code for the tools I'm using to generate the
compiler. I'll change that should the source find its way into the tree.

&gt;<i> I'm +1 on this, and would suggest a patch as soon as you get a chance.

If all goes well expect an issue on Mantis by the weekend :)
