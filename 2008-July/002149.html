<PRE>We have a number of variables in estate_settings.xml. One of them is region_flags which is used to start and stop scripts amongst a number of other things. 

Since we are already able to start and stop scripts from the estate menu, we are already both reading and writing variables such as region_flags.

It would be really wonderful if you could expand your commentary a bit. I know there is some complexity in this area and understanding what you intend to do is one of my goals. With all due respect, the comments made so far are a somewhat simplistic description of a more complex issue.

As a result, I have significant concerns about how the proposal to change this functionality will work. So, please explain a bit more in technical detail to describe what your are intending to do.

Charles

Hi,

That was already covered in Mantis, but I repeat for completeness' sake.

The defaults are taken com estate_settings.xml. That file, if it 
exists, is always the base to which the settings get initialized. If 
it doesn't exist, the settings are initialized to sane hardcoded 
default.

Then, it tries to read a database record. If it is found, it will 
override the defaults gathered in the previous step.

If the settings are changed, the database is updated. If there is no 
database, then this update will not happen, and estate_settings.xml 
will again be read at the next start.

Standalone will be handled the same as grid mode, it uses the same 
datastore. I will supply MySQL (already done), SQLite and Null modules.

We don't officially support MSSQL, so interested parties will have 
to do that implementation. MSSQL will be treated like Null, e.g. 
read estate_settings.xml on each start, until they do.

Melanie
