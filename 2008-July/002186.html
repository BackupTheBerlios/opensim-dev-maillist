<PRE>
As per the discussion on irc earlier today, I agreed to summarize the 
plans to move forward with separating LSL from the current DotNet 
engine, to make use of the shared structures proposed with the new 
xengine. This isn't complete by any means, but meant to start an email 
discussion.

The current DotNetEngine needs to be changed to make it able to process 
events and share LSL and other languages via API files:

1. Use the IScriptEngine and IScript interfaces to support a per 
instance object in the ScriptManager
- changes to refactor IScript using the AppDomainObject (IScript) from 
Shared and to rescope the existing IScript to IScriptInstance and move 
outside AppDomain

2.Use  EventParams and DetectParams

I have been toying with the idea of either patching the DotNet engine or 
just porting the DotNet enhanced functionality to a XEngine clone for a 
new DotNet base. Since we are already proposing isolating the languages 
there is certain advantages to the later. The former would leave some 
problems to fix, which have already been resolved in the XEngine. Either 
way, I think a fork to a 3rd engine would be the best approach. This 
would allow others to get involved, and retain both engines as they are 
today, and not break everyone all  by simply having a 3rd engine for a 
while.

Comments?
