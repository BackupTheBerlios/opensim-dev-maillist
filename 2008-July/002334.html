<PRE>I have been getting requests for status, so I thought it was time for a 
brief status summary on where I am and a brain dump on what needs to be 
done and how I plan to get there.

When I have had the opportunity to work on it, I have basically been 
refactoring all that is in ScriptEngine.Common (not including 
ScriptEngineBase) out and either move it into ScriptEngine.DotNetEngine 
or merge the code directly into ScriptEngine or ScriptManager. That was 
going well until I hit the Async plugins and iScript*. I went through 
several iterations trying to retain his code temporarily, but today 
realized that it would be easier to just go ahead and switch it over to 
use ScriptEngine.Shared and ScriptEngine.Shared.Api. Of course, this 
brought its own set of problems, but allowed me to completely remove a 
temporary iScript and LSL_Types from DotNetEngine and change the 
assemply references for DotNetEngine.  I have already factored out all 
the ScriptServer interfaces and the iScriptEngineFunctionModule. Also, 
as per an IRC chat with Tedd, the ScriptServer and its associated 
interfaces can be removed from prebuild.

So, my course and speed has varied, but my current goal is now to just 
simply cut the ties to ScriptEngine.Common as a first part to a multi 
phased approach. The next step will be to deal with the AppDomain and 
IScript and IScriptEngine, and, eventually Events. ;-) 

Also, the general consensus from the core community is that the proper 
way to get to a DotNet engine with common language APIs is to fix the 
one we have, not have a temporary 3rd engine as I proposed in my first 
email on the subject. I somewhat agree with this approach, but it will 
mean that this will progress slowly. When I get to something that 
compiles, I will create a patch and post it to a mantis defect for 
community review. I am still shooting to make that happen this week.

Comments?
