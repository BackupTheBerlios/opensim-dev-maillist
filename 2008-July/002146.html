That was already covered in Mantis, but I repeat for completeness' sake.

The defaults are taken com estate_settings.xml. That file, if it 
exists, is always the base to which the settings get initialized. If 
it doesn't exist, the settings are initialized to sane hardcoded 
default.

Then, it tries to read a database record. If it is found, it will 
override the defaults gathered in the previous step.

If the settings are changed, the database is updated. If there is no 
database, then this update will not happen, and estate_settings.xml 
will again be read at the next start.

Standalone will be handled the same as grid mode, it uses the same 
datastore. I will supply MySQL (already done), SQLite and Null modules.

We don't officially support MSSQL, so interested parties will have 
to do that implementation. MSSQL will be treated like Null, e.g. 
read estate_settings.xml on each start, until they do.

Melanie
