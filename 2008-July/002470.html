<PRE>Ok, being vague as usual, but:
 
The 'Framework' thing came from when we thought the project would be used as a &quot;Library Core&quot; with several &quot;business implementations&quot;
 
(remember, we started out with the ambition to do _Scene_ optional...)
 
The &quot;Library Core&quot; would consist of just the things that all OpenSim applications would need to run, ie, a tight set of assemblies with a lot of interfaces, and some abstract basic implementations.Even if I think it was a good idea (Tribal uses OpenSim that way) I guess that's not really where the project is headed at the moment - over time, stuff has been put into Framework out of laziness (not wanting to do that refactor/introduce that new project et c)
 
So, if anybody wants to take a stab at formulating some new approach, be my guest.
 
We (MW and I) have already suggested an MVC-ish approach a couple of time, but there never was any real comments on that, so I guess it went dead in the water. :D
 
I'm a firm believer that we don't necessarily have to make big rewrites; as long as we have a common image of the goal; and that we all work towards that goal when doing our daily design decisions.
