<PRE>In technical terms, this would mean leveraging the mechanism used in 
&quot;Edit appearance&quot;.

So, if you change outfit, the client would cause new clothing items 
to be created (in region cache only, possibly), populate those with 
the visual params, ignore any texture information sent back, and 
then upload the baked textures.

This can almost be done with today's opensim, and actually it would 
bring universal appearance even to SL!
The only serverside consideration would be to prevent this method 
from creating permanent assets, everything else would be client side 
and would already work today.

With prim clothing, this is more complex and may, depending on 
permissions, not even work (you need at least build permission to 
upload the prim attachments), but if the grid as such has support 
for prim attachments and region-crossing while wearing them, then 
each would need to be uploaded only once. A client equipped in such 
a way would possibly be able to manage those as part of a 
meta-inventory, keeping track of the asset ID of each copy on each 
grid and presenting just a single item to the user.

As far as avatar portability goes, this is one of the best 
suggestions I have heard, because it bypasses all this asset sharing 
stuff, allowing those creators who are so inclined to choose DRM 
over portability, but letting the user make a choice of having local 
wearables that will work anywhere!

I like that, +1
