Hi Ai,

I deprecated the original xml format in favour of xml2 because there 
didn't seem any good reason (as MW said) to retain two xml formats that 
did the same thing.  I assumed that xml2 was more advanced in some way, 
but actually it's not hugely different.

I see that the parameters that xml accepts do need to be accepted by 
xml2 as well, so this should happen before xml goes away.  Also, extra 
options to support the use cases you've described sound like a good idea.

The xml restored objects should go to the current region I think - I'm 
surprised this isn't happening but what you're seeing certainly isn't 
impossible, as the region information is embedded in the persisted prim. 
  This probably needs to be resolved.

There is an archive format coming which will save out and reload assets 
as well as the prim xml file.  This should start to make it easier to 
move models between setups.
