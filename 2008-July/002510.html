<PRE>Hi friends, we read your feedbacks with enthusiasm and will surely ask you
many questions.

We are currently trying to decide some priorities on learning and correcting
issues, so I'm just putting here some of the arguments. Purpose is to have
something to start with, not just flood you with questions :)

I personally feel we need some in-depth good understanding (not necessarily
in the real priority order):
Maybe you can also help in understanding if Mantis are already for following
points

1\ Tall avatar sanded feet. Where is really decided the height of Avatar in
the physical engine? I sent an example patch just adding .3f when rendering
the av height, but people correctly objected that it should be computed from
the av height and not just as an additional hack (but see next point where
already opensim is full of hacks :) )
2\ Rezzing objects from inventory. Now they are &quot;sanded&quot; uncorrectly and in
some cases even hid by other objects so risk is to rez objects without
seeing them rezzing. It appears that &quot;creating&quot; them is OK, because in the
code there is a hard coded +0.5f to make them appear properly.
3\ Cutting and Hollowing prims is now better working than some weeks ago,
but cylinder cutting is still NOT correctly working. I developed a cylinder
30x30x4 repeated n times with various cut to leave &quot;doors&quot; for entering in
the inner circle. It seems that the algorithm doesn't computes correctly
where we can enter / exit. I've some problems in understanding which code is
active in the various physics engines and if it is common for all engines.
4\ IM should be stored in queues if recipient is not online and not just
rejected.
5\ Handling of proper internal Email mechanism for internal communication
system among regions
6\ Date of things in Inventory: I supplied a patch which was able to put a
date when an object is taken or passed between Avatars, but direct creation
of Notecards, Scripts, Skin, Shapes still have unknown date.
7\ Groups handling. Efficient group handling might be a great way to
establish inworld cooperation, maybe even better than in SL itself. How can
we produce something similar?
8\ Objects serialization/deserialization. It would be quite interesting for
full permissions object to do that without owning the sim. Something like
llSerializeObject2String() and viceversa.

These are already immense programming effort, so we might concentrate only
on a portion of these depending on the complexity, priorities and how much
help we can get :)

Feel free to contact me personally, and I will forward to the group...

Regarding the wiki part we will soon produce some Italian results and will
contribute with the opensimulator.org wiki as well. But we are still in an
alpha organizational phase. :)
