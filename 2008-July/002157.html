<PRE>Err since when didn't we officially support MSSQL?. I don't think its a case of not supporting it, I think its just been a case of it lagging behind the others as not as many people use it. But some people do, not so much on the regions, but at least on the grid server side. Us being one of those who uses it on the grid servers. 

Really as to the question if this change would needed to be supported in the mssql code, I'm not sure, really if we have MSSQL support in the svn then it should be usable, but nothing ever works out pefect. So I think this is a open question.

That was already covered in Mantis, but I repeat for completeness' sake.

The defaults are taken com estate_settings.xml. That file, if it 
exists, is always the base to which the settings get initialized. If 
it doesn't exist, the settings are initialized to sane hardcoded 
default.

Then, it tries to read a database record. If it is found, it will 
override the defaults gathered in the previous step.

If the settings are changed, the database is updated. If there is no 
database, then this update will not happen, and estate_settings.xml 
will again be read at the next start.

Standalone will be handled the same as grid mode, it uses the same 
datastore. I will supply MySQL (already done), SQLite and Null modules.

We don't officially support MSSQL, so interested parties will have 
to do that implementation. MSSQL will be treated like Null, e.g. 
read estate_settings.xml on each start, until they do.
