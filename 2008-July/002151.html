The ultimate goal of this patch is to obsolete estate_settings.xml 
in a gentle transition.

Xml config files are required only for a setup using the Null 
storage plugin, and can trivially be implemented within that plugin.
Even in that configuration, the architectural changes will make per 
region settings, rather than per instance settings, possible.

Also, this series of patches aims to make the support for the estate 
dialog into a module and make that module optional. It is not needed 
for any client other than the linden one, and should therefore not 
be a required part of Scene.

It will also expand the region parameter storage design to a point 
where it is capable of storing flags not related to the LL client, 
or the SL way of doing things.


Melanie
