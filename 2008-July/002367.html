<PRE>As per the title, I just uploaded a patch #1780  
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1780">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1780</A>  Sorry, it is huge....

Attached below is the text in the mantis for a brief status of where I 
am at. Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, 
suggestions, etc.

So the first question will be, &quot;why this now, why not wait until you 
have something?&quot;  Answer:  1) I want to give everyone the opportunity to 
stay in the loop on what I am doing,  2) I am going to be off grid (on 
vacation) for most of next week.  I may checkin from time to time, but 
will not be making any progress here for a while  :(

=====================================

This patch compiles and runs, but a script will not yet compile due to 
the DotNet compiler having hard-coded common references that it builds 
into the translated scripts. I tried to fix this, but the right thing to 
do is just use the shared compiler. In order to do this, it will require 
moving to IScriptEngine, which is my next step. This patch just shows 
the work done so far to seperate DotNet from Common, which is a success, 
however incremental.

This patch is completely separate from common (except the compiler 
mentioned above). Moving to IScriptEngine will eliminate several files 
pulled into DotNetEngine namespace. Please don't apply this patch and 
tell me that it doesnt work. This is a work-in-progress and is posted 
here just for community review. I just want to keep everyone in the loop.

I realize this patch is difficult to read because of all the new files 
to dotnetengine. The result is that most of the work done in these files 
is transparent because the files are &quot;new&quot; in the patch. If there is 
enough interest, I'll see if I can diff all the new files to 
dotnetengine with the originals in common and post those diffs here.
