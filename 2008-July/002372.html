<PRE>Also the permissions manager is (or should be) designed so that other permissions managers can be created/used. So if someone has a requirement for a different behaviour on their region then they can use/implement another one. 

OpenSim isn't and can't be about implementing the permission managers (or any other part) for every use case. It is just a platform and a reference implementation.
 
 One problem is that anyone running a region could easily disable the whole permissions manager, if they wished. The only way around this, is really for the Grids/region owners to agree to some TOS/Contract. 
 
 That is what LL / SL does, there is nothing technical stopping them from disabling the permissions systems on whatever regions they want (or all of them). But they have agreed to honour a set of permissions. So their system is just based on Trust. The same system can be implemented in OpenSim, the grid/region operator just has to show that they can be trusted. 
 
 Like, if you were on a open grid that anyone could connect a region to. Then no matter what permissions manager was implemented, it wouldn't stop the region owner from doing whatever they want, to objects placed in their region. As they could just disable the permissions manager. 
 
OpenSim is not about creating any one grid/application. Its about creating a base platform that other people can take and adapt to whatever they want. So someone who wants a different permissions system on their grid, could implement one, then do various things to make sure all regions on that grid have it enabled. And show the users that it can be trusted.

&quot;Frisby, Adam&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">adam at deepthink.com.au</A>&gt; wrote: Parcel owners is a tenuous one, and I'd agree that permissions should be enforced there, although I can understand the logic behind &quot;If it's on your parcel, you should be able to do what you want with it.&quot;.

However region operators I do believe should have access to anything running on their regions. The reason for this being simply that if the code is operating on their servers, they deserve the ability to observe what is going on, if you don't want it looked at - sign a contract with your operator enforcing that, or host it yourself. (This is nothing different to how ISPs and Webhosts have the ability to look at scripts running on your website account)

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Opensim-dev] Resolved Mantis issue..... Reconsideration?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recently submitted a mantis report on an issue which you can view
</I>&gt;<i> here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1784">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1784</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This report was marked resolved and I quote the response to my report
</I>&gt;<i> here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The current implementation of the permissions module was designed to
</I>&gt;<i> give
</I>&gt;<i> parcel owners godlike powers. Parcel owners are able to take and
</I>&gt;<i> manipulate
</I>&gt;<i> anything over their land. This is design behavior. The permissions
</I>&gt;<i> module
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't represent the SL permissions system, and was never intended to
</I>&gt;<i> do
</I>&gt;<i> that.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not talking about simply manipulating... ie moving, etc, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> talking
</I>&gt;<i> about obtaining permissions the original creator never intended for an
</I>&gt;<i> item.
</I>&gt;<i> I understand this feature is functioning as designed, but I am
</I>&gt;<i> requesting a &quot;Reconsideration&quot; of this feature as I see this as
</I>&gt;<i> detrimental to the success of this project.
</I>&gt;<i> I am of the opinion that &quot;Godlike&quot; powers shouldn't be given to an
</I>&gt;<i> individual just because land is in their name, instead it should be
</I>&gt;<i> reserved for only estate owners/managers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do believe this to be a &quot;REAL&quot; issue as anything a person has been
</I>&gt;<i> given, even it was was given to them with the intentions of it being
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;USABLE&quot; but not modifiable or copyable is able to be copied by the
</I>&gt;<i> owner if he/she is on their land.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's an example:
</I>&gt;<i> Another user gives me a scripted item for me to use, but doesn't want
</I>&gt;<i> me
</I>&gt;<i> to have access to the script, then he's out of luck because I can take
</I>&gt;<i> it back to my land and copy it and I will then have full rights to it
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> my land... including seeing or potentially being able to &quot;TAKE&quot; his
</I>&gt;<i> script and use it, and or modify it as my own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This will become a &quot;REAL&quot; issue very soon now that llGiveInventory has
</I>&gt;<i> become functional.
</I>&gt;<i> Many users in my grid are waiting for me to implement currency so that
</I>&gt;<i> they can setup vendors to sell their no copy/mod items to other users.
</I>&gt;<i> Once the &quot;BUYER&quot; purchases an item it will no longer honor the
</I>&gt;<i> permissions the creator intended once it is on the buyer's land.
</I>&gt;<i> Some have made items for others to use with the intentions that the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;USER&quot; can use the item all they want, but they do not want them to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to copy it or give it away, or worse... sell it as their own. With
</I>&gt;<i> the current permissions system this cannot work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I respectfully challenge that this &quot;IS&quot; in fact a real issue that needs
</I>&gt;<i> addressing ASAP due to the ability of the Second Inventory program
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> will allow transferring items to other grids.  This ability will soon
</I>&gt;<i> give the whole project a &quot;BIG BLACK EYE&quot; once realization of this
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Design Behavior&quot; is discovered by newcomers if not corrected.  If a
</I>&gt;<i> creator cannot be reassured that their creation will have workable
</I>&gt;<i> permissions &quot;ANYWHERE&quot; on a particular grid then those who seek to
</I>&gt;<i> protect their creations will no longer consider an OpenSim based grid
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> a viable option for them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is my opinion, With the number of grids increasing and with all of
</I>&gt;<i> the publicity OpenSim has received recently it is only a matter of time
</I>&gt;<i> until this becomes a public relations nightmare not only for grid
</I>&gt;<i> operators but for the whole project in general.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't get me wrong, I do understand this is a work in progress and this
</I>&gt;<i> issue may not have mattered in the past, but I respectfully request you
</I>&gt;<i> reconsider your position on this issue and give it a priority status as
</I>&gt;<i> it does in fact matter now and the issue will worsen with each new
</I>&gt;<i> opensim user and opensim grid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank-you for your time,
</I>&gt;<i> -Terry Ford (aka: Butch Arnold)
