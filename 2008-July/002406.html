<PRE>I have a little problem today in that &quot;Wright Plaza&quot; has crashed to bash 3 times since updating from r5574 to r5595. I did create a Mantis and captured the crash and it is Mantis#1810.

I understand some important inventory changes were made last night, but in order to keep the region from crashing, I had to put it back to r5574.

It might have something to do with executing the &quot;show version&quot; command as their was a crash shortly after someone did a &quot;show version&quot;. It is interesting to note, that I do a build on a build system and then scp to the various servers a common set of binaries. Maybe there is a sensitivity with the missing .svn file with recent releases.

I am hoping that someone might have an idea or two while I am trying to pretend I am working for the business day.

Charles
