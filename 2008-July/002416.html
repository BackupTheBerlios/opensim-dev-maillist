<PRE>I guess I need to weigh in and describe my strategy which myself and others have been using for over a year now.

With each update, when there are problems, there are two choices. And pretty much, these two choices are for anyone.

1. Press forward and help diagnose and improve.
2. Revert to last known functioning.

Most of the time, we urge the testers to move forward and deploy the latest and provide feedback to help that forward motion. Occaisionally, we suggest holding at a particular revision for a while.

So, this is a balance between sufficient forward motion and keeping functionality and the balance shifts based on the reality and perception each day.

Charles

Yup, totally agree that we want to get people away from using trunk for deployment. So with that I take back my suggestion. 

Was just thinking about cutting back the support questions/problems from irc. As we all know that too many people do update to the lastest trunk every day (or two) and expect it to always work.

Honestly, part of the point of trunk is to sort out these bugs.  If
folks need stability, trunk isn't for them. :)  If people want to make
the future stable, and can handle some issues now, trunk is for them.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
