<PRE>Hi,

But some people do, not so much on the regions, but at least on the grid server side. Us being one of those who uses it on the grid servers.

Well, I was told that there is not currently anyone supporting and 
coding fro MSSQL. I was also told why there is currently no one 
doing MSSQL coding.
So, well, I made an assumption. Sorry.

Like many here, I can't write MSSQL stuff because I can't test it.
