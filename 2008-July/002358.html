One comment I forgot to make on the bug tracker that affects the public
interface and thus requires public comments:

Currently the GridServer_Config.xml has a database_provider field, which
is the file name of the DLL that the user wishes to use for their
database. 

For example: 
&lt;Root&gt;
&lt;Config ... database_provider=&quot;OpenSim.Data.MySQL.dll&quot; ... /&gt;
&lt;/Root&gt;

One of the key features of Mono.Addins (and any other sane plugin loader
IMO) is that it abstracts away a dependence on system file names in
favor of an abstract &quot;extension point&quot; for the sink, which looks a
little bit like a path (ex: &quot;/OpenSim/GridData&quot;), and an abstract &quot;addin
id&quot; for the source, which is the fully qualified .NET namespace if you
leave it as default (ex: &quot;OpenSim.Data.MySQL.MySQLGridData&quot;).

This allows you to decouple provider and consumer, and is a cleaner
architecture.

Currently OpenSim takes all the classes in a certain namespace and rolls
them into one assembly (ex: OpenSim.Data.MySQL.* -&gt;
OpenSim.Data.MySQL.dll), which acts as a provider for all database
related functionality.

When Mono.Addins starts up, it builds a registry of addins by reading
all assemblies (ex: OpenSim.Data.MySQL.dll,
OpenSim.Data.MSSQL.dll, ...), and extracting the meta-information about
which assemblies provide for which extension points (ex: both MySQL.dll
and MSSQL.dll provide for &quot;/OpenSim/GridData&quot;).

In order to select only one (ex: of MySQL or MSSQL), I have to read the
configuration file, and filter the addins based on the content of
&quot;database_provider&quot;.

My patch adds a bit of a hack that transforms that DLL file name back
into the fully qualified namespace by striping the &quot;dll&quot;, copying the
the nearest namespace member (ex: &quot;MySQL&quot;) and appending the class we
are looking for, in order to map the &quot;database_provider&quot; into a &quot;addin
id == fully qualified name&quot;.

This is a fragile hack because it relies on a close mapping from file
names to .NET names, and if that ever changes this all breaks.

I am currently investigating a more robust method of mapping/filtering,
but it should be decided whether the current hack is acceptable for the
time being.

In the future I expect that database_provider will have to be changed
from a file name to an abstract name such as simply &quot;MySQL&quot; or &quot;MSSQL&quot;,
and that would affect existing installations.

Cheers,
