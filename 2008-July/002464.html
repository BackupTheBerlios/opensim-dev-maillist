&gt;<i>a quick follow on, what I mean about it being too rigid, is that by having a set userserver set
</I>&gt;<i>url in the inventory server.
</I>I think I have to explain more about the security change.

[definition:]
* To put inventoryserver and userserver separatly, means they are on different servers and use
   different DB.
* &quot;inventory information&quot; is very *closely* related to user information(inventoryids belongs to a userid),
  but &quot;inventory information&quot; does not contain enough information that can prove user's identity.
 * Inventoryserver holds such kind of &quot;inventory information&quot;
* Userserver holds the information that can prove user's identity(uuid/name,password) 
[problem:]
* If we put inventoryserver separate from userserver, then inventoryserver can not claim user's
   identity by itself
  =&gt; inventoryserver has to rely on 1 or some userservers. (check_auth_session call is neccessary)
// Above, is the current situation
[solution for &quot;too rigid&quot;:]
* add a new table for inventoryserver, 2 fields, useruuid, userserver_url, everytime inventoryserver
   extract &quot;session_id&quot;, &quot;user_id&quot; from the request, get &quot;userserver_url&quot; by &quot;user_id&quot;, then check the
  identity of &quot;user_id&quot; from &quot;userserver_url&quot; (call check_auth_session)

I really think rather than the inventory server calling a authenticate method on the user server. That the user server should send a sessionid to the inventory server when a new login happens. I guess your idea of the userserver_url was something silmilar in that the userserver would update it when a user logs in? Otherwise if it was just &quot;hardcoded&quot; in the db then it wouldn't solve anything.

Of course there is also the case of a user being online on multiple &quot;grids&quot; at the same time while using a single inventory server (which we have done). But if needed that shouldn't be too hard for someone to make the changes themselves. (just store mutliple sessions/grid pairs per user's inventory).

 
&gt;<i>It makes it harder to use the same inventory server on multiple grids.
</I>&gt;<i>Either for the same user (if their id on each grid was the same).
</I>  &gt;Or just multiple grids/user groups sharing a common inventory server.
Have you ever think about 1 grid uses multiple inventoryservers. :&gt;
Sounds like the opposite of what you said, but I think inventoryserver should be thought in this way:
 *** inventoryserver is serving for the users, not the grids/regions.
I mean, inventory server should not be always tied up with grids, no matter 1 to n or n to 1,
inventory server just exists for &quot;users&quot;, and the &quot;users&quot; maybe from different grids.

I really not sure what you mean here? Nothing I have said would stop multiple inventory servers on 1 grid. In fact I think my suggestions would make these easier to support. Also yes I'm totally talking about making a inventory server , serve users rather than &quot;grids&quot;. Just at the moment with the security system as it is currently. It is set up for exactly the opposite. Its tying a inventory server to a grid.

I think inventory and in the future asset servers. Should be thought of a seperate services. That a user could pick whatever service they want to hold their inventory/assets and create a account on it. Then tell whatever &quot;grid&quot; they join/are part of to use that service. All they should need to do is set the permissions of the inventory/asset account so that the grid can access it (I also think eventally that permissions should be at the folder level, so can give a grid read only permissions or something). 
 
This is also a part of my plan of &quot;interop&quot;, please refer to
