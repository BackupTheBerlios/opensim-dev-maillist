<PRE>Well, I've been nagging everybody about us starting to think of what the 'base cases' are; for example,
 
if our base-base-base case was &quot;the standalone region open to unauthenticated and anonymous access, but allowing no editing whatsoever&quot; then one could start thinking about how that region would actually set up sessions, fetch needed data (what data?) and how you would hand-off sessions between such regions (like, what would 'teleport' mean between disconnected regions?)
 
Just to give you an idea; If we had &quot;avatar appearance&quot; implemented as a REST service, the only thing the base case would need to create the avatar would be a web page that it could GET an avatar appearance from.
 
This would mean that ANY region could use your static (xml?) web page as a template to show your avatar to the others in the region - you don't have an 'avatar appearance domain service' - merely a web page.
 
Of course, if you would POST an avatar appearance to it, it couldn't be a static web page, it would have to be some simple php page accepting that data and storing it.
 
Now, the security problem; you would never do a php page that would take whatever from whoever, so, either the region had to provide some authentication, or you simply have a &quot;home region&quot; which is the only one allowed to post appearance from. In effect, you would only be able to modify your avatar when being in a trusted region.
This kind of scenario would solve quite a lot of features with a minimal amount of protocol design.
 
And yes, assets; it would be quite doable to create an asset model where all local asset id's were dynamically translated to and from URLs - hence solving quite a lot of other features and problems with a minimal amount of effort.
The asset Id could (should, imnsho) be seen as an affair purely between the client and the region; ie, no two regions would have the same asset id for the same url data. Or, it could be the regions sha-1 hash or the binary data, if a region wants to communicate with a shared and trusted asset cache instead of directly to the url.
 
No, I'm not talking specific solutions here, just trying to wedge us away from the predominant mind-set onto something truly new and glorious.
