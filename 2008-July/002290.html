I lot of people have said to me that basically a 38 MB download and a
seperate icon is all that is keeping people from coming in world in
droves.  I remain unconvinced by that position.  They seem to have
forgotten the technology curve that got us here, and how this all played
out when the browser showed up as well. :)

I think people also forget how fickle the web 2.0 property space is.
Every single new browser based 3D thing (there are plenty) merges the
platform with the application (which the web does not do).  Frienster 
-&gt; Orkut -&gt; MySpace -&gt; Facebook -&gt; ?.  If you application and platform
are the same thing, your platform crash and burns with your application
going out of vogue.

It's one of the many reasons I'm all for the OpenSim approach.  It's a
platform.  With just content work you get a social space, with more
work, you can have many more interesting 3D apps.  It's also one of the
reasons I think &quot;grid jump&quot; is an important feature for us in 0.7.  The
applications will come and go from vogue, but if there is a reasonable
way to just pop between them, the user experience won't be limitted to
one application, but will be interested in getting around between all of
them.... like a browser.  Hey look at that. :)

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
