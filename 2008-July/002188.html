<PRE>Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> In the common file are all the things like llSay(), llCeil(), llFloor() that just are wrappers around C# subroutines. In fact, 85% of the original LSL_BuiltIn_Commands.cs and the new, copied file are identical.

</I>&gt;<i> So, I would say, lets have an interface, or a derived class, or whatever you feel comfortable with and just move forward.

</I>&gt;<i> The most important thing to me in this whole controversy right now is to not have two identical copies of hundreds of little subroutines.
</I>
LSL_Api.cs _is_ that new file. No subclassing is needed or useful. 
The API is in LSL_Api.cs. It contains everything that was in 
LSL_BuiltIn_Commands.cs and obsoletes that file.
Both engines will use the new pluggable API structure. Directly, 
without subclass, because that is what it was specifically designed 
to allow.
