Please show me where the rough idea that was discussed has descended 
even to the depth that would be required to mention implementation 
details like security?

As everything in OpenSim, this concept tries to address a real need 
in a way that allows most options. No one said that region operators 
should not be able to confine chat to their regions, or choose to 
not allow nonlocal groups to be used on the grid. Ultimately, it is 
all under control of each region.

There are two very valid concerns to be addressed:

- group communication should be extensible across grid boundaries, 
if desired by both grid operators
- groups should be usable as permission vessels within a grid

Since you -1'd it, I suppose you can present a concept that 
addresses those in a manner acceptable to you?

Melanie
