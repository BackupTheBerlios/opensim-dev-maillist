<PRE>Hello,

Not too long ago, I started working on a new viewer targeted at OpenSim 
users. I like the idea of using links like &quot;<A HREF="opensim://user.server:port/">opensim://user.server:port/</A>&quot; 
to easily connect to another grid. They can be handled by the viewer 
directly, but the viewer needs more information on the grid, like login 
page and helper URI.

I suggest to add a new function &quot;get_grid_info&quot; to the user server, that 
returns an LLSD map containing information on the grid required by the 
viewer. The LLSD map allows to add more information any time, without 
breaking older viewers.

Below is an ad-hoc list of information that would be useful to the 
viewer. I am sure there is more... :-)

    * Grid name for display, allowing space and other special characters.
    * Short grid ID or &quot;unixname&quot;, alphanumeric, preferably lower-case.
      It can be used as a part of file names for storing grid-specific
      information and settings.
    * Link to the login page.
    * The helper URI.
    * Link to the grid's web site.
    * Link for &quot;create account&quot;.
    * Link for &quot;forgotten password&quot;.
    * Link for &quot;help&quot; and F1.

I guess this is not a huge effort to implement. Apart from making 
<A HREF="opensim://">opensim://</A> links work smoothly, it would save the user from typing all 
those options on the command line.

Ohh, and if someone is interested in trying my viewer, more details and 
download are at
    <A HREF="http://mjm.game-host.org/opensim:viewer:contents">http://mjm.game-host.org/opensim:viewer:contents</A>

My plans are to move it over to SourceForge, creating a platform for 
experimenting with OpenSim specific features, as they have been 
discussed here.
The viewer should nevertheless still be able to connect to Second Life. :-)

And, hmm, as it connects by default to OSGrid, and I really love the 
hippo, I would like to try replacing all the SL icons with the OSGrid 
hippo. Would it be OK, to use the OSGrid hippo in that way? I think 
&quot;Hippo OpenSim Viewer&quot; would also be a nice name...

Any comments welcome... :-)

Mana
