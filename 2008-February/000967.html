<PRE>Well, so far as one of those many that's handled the packet code, I've
been chasing down some inefficiencies in the login sequence. I could use
some more people trying out the UserThreadPoolBranch of the repo.

If you understand git then you can fetch a more recent version that was
just merged against trunk yesterday at
<A HREF="http://brianw.terrabox.com/OpenSim/OpenSim.git">http://brianw.terrabox.com/OpenSim/OpenSim.git</A>  as branch UTPBranch (or
was it UserTHreadPool, brain wonky before first coffee)

It replaces the thread per user creation with a dedicated threadpool.
Some people report one impression, others another, andit works &quot;great&quot;
for me personally. So more eyes on what it's doign to syetems would be
appreciated. :)

</I>&gt;<i> why.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I do see that causes me to write things like the original post,
</I>&gt;<i> is that we are all embedded in this sort of defacto organic process
</I>&gt;<i> that is admittedly producing profound results, but that on occasion
</I>&gt;<i> has us making mistakes that are, in a more directed effort, outpaced
</I>&gt;<i> with a bit of planning.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dont get me wrong ;) I have no interest in seeing some big highly
</I>&gt;<i> articulated roadmap, it would be stale before it could be edited up
</I>&gt;<i> and posted. Nor the sort of monolithic top-down control that would be
</I>&gt;<i> required to produce and implement such.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I *do* think we need to try to adapt effectively in some way
</I>&gt;<i> to some of the circumstances that arise from our somewhat undirected
</I>&gt;<i> workflow as developers and testers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My #1 concern as I tried to raise awareness on some of these
</I>&gt;<i> occurrences (my apologies for being so coarsely informed about some of
</I>&gt;<i> the deeper details of grid communications) was to draw attention to
</I>&gt;<i> the possibility that a lot of the bug hunting we were doing was
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps misguided, and the result of providing completely uncontrolled
</I>&gt;<i> access to the osgrid infrastructure to potential region operators. To
</I>&gt;<i> be clear, I do not have philosophical issues with this wrt osgrid,
</I>&gt;<i> indeed, I am very much in favor of letting everyone connect up who
</I>&gt;<i> wants to - with a few very specific and definable exceptions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1&gt; the pathologically misconfigured
</I>&gt;<i> 2&gt; the pathologically ignorant
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The former we can address in a variety of ways - tools are the key.
</I>&gt;<i> The latter, not so much. But if we take care of #1, it pretty much
</I>&gt;<i> covers #2 as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MW, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression about getting
</I>&gt;<i> commitments and producing new work on the 'packet handling code' (a
</I>&gt;<i> label I'm already regretting my use of ;)  Of course many have
</I>&gt;<i> contributed to it and no one 'owns' it. I think what I was after there
</I>&gt;<i> was to try and form up a concerted effort to revisit the work thats
</I>&gt;<i> been done, in the interest of freshening it up and ensuring that no
</I>&gt;<i> opportunities had been missed to make it more stable and/or efficient.
</I>&gt;<i> Any such effort is necesarily informal, but I think it would be far
</I>&gt;<i> more effective if all concerned agree in advance that its an effort
</I>&gt;<i> worthy of undertaking. Also, I don't think I envisioned compelling
</I>&gt;<i> anything of anyone, so much as getting confirmation they were either
</I>&gt;<i> (dis)interested/just had other things to do or, prepared to come focus
</I>&gt;<i> together with us on this specific area of endeavor. Sure it is
</I>&gt;<i> *possible* for anyone to just dive in and start working on the code;
</I>&gt;<i> but it isn't *practical*, per se.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks so much for taking the time to read my spiel and contribute
</I>&gt;<i> your thoughts. I have every confidence that mere awareness of these
</I>&gt;<i> concerns will have a profound impact on what happens afterwards :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers!
