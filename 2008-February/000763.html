In the extreme case, there are no grids whatsoever - just standalone sims,
which hold the information to the standalone asset/agent,etc. servers.

I think I already sent this link of my experiments with this extreme case:
<A HREF="http://daltonic.blogspot.com/2007/11/interdomain-teleports-revised.html">http://daltonic.blogspot.com/2007/11/interdomain-teleports-revised.html</A>

It's indeed in no way how it *will* be done, the interdomain teleport is
much more than just hopping the client from sim to sim - and as we were
discussing, in the first phase maybe a simple &quot;flattening&quot; of the various
grids together would do the trick to allow to work out the various
surrounding issues.

I said it not once, and will repeat this - the concept of &quot;grid&quot; is not
scalable to the large size (hundreds of thousands of regions) in the case of
separately-administered and separately provisioned servers - it is a point
of concentration of big network and CPU load and admin overhead. The only
reason for it to exist would be the monetary - however, I think the business
model would be more interesting around the content hosting
(asset/inventory/sim hosting) rather than the grid as such - the UGA is a
necessary evil to glue together the disparate sims for the start.

Indeed all of this rant-ish stuff is not an intent to ditch the concept of
grid altogether - there is definitely a place for the &quot;distributed flat
world of a small scale&quot;. Just that we should not keep it as the only usage
scenario.
