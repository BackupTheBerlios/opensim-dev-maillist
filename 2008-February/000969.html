<PRE>I agree 100% with you on the purpose and use of OSGrid. 

I also think you have done a great job on making the right decisions and
managing OSGrid. :) I don't think anyone else could have done any better
than you have.

Keep on truckin!

</I>&gt;<i> other branches on test regions and compare their performance with svn,
</I>&gt;<i> but we are trying to set the standard with the UGAI and the plazas.
</I>&gt;<i> One of the primary short-term goals is to have a controlled
</I>&gt;<i> environment to provide feedback to keep OpenSim moving in the
</I>&gt;<i> direction of stability and reliability.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There have been and will still be times of instability. At those times
</I>&gt;<i> we have 3 choices. 1) Go back to the last perceived stable revision 2)
</I>&gt;<i> Stay at the current revision or 3) Move forward to the latest
</I>&gt;<i> revision.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Each day when this decision is made, it is a balance to try to help us
</I>&gt;<i> move forward in the most straight-forward manner. I cannot say that I
</I>&gt;<i> always make the correct decision. Any input that the developers wish
</I>&gt;<i> to make to effect choice 1, 2 or 3 on a regular basis will be given
</I>&gt;<i> great weight. After all, we are trying to make it more reliable and at
</I>&gt;<i> different times we need to adjust our update strategy for the benefit
</I>&gt;<i> of OpenSim development and balance that for the greatest perceived
</I>&gt;<i> stability in this major public grid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This morning, the number of regions topped 200. The logins are running
</I>&gt;<i> over 300 per day on average. Dozens of new accounts are added each
</I>&gt;<i> day. There are 40000 assets in the mysql database. There is
</I>&gt;<i> significant traffic on Wright Plaza on the order of dozens if
</I>&gt;<i> different users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, we are beginning to deeply exercise the software and we find that
</I>&gt;<i> in a heterogeneous network environment with a mixture of Windows and
</I>&gt;<i> Linux servers spread over several continents running on pipes that go
</I>&gt;<i> from cable modems to GigE interfaces is exposing data we would not
</I>&gt;<i> normally see with quick stand alone tests after a commit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would urge us to use this resource more to wring out the details of
</I>&gt;<i> how our software is performing as others begin deploying it in other,
</I>&gt;<i> even less controlled setups. Please invent tests that allow all of us
</I>&gt;<i> to compare Windows/Linux, differing revisions, inventory usage
</I>&gt;<i> scenarios and others to allow us to make our software more robust.

</I>&gt;<i> Well, so far as one of those many that's handled the packet code, I've
</I>&gt;<i> been chasing down some inefficiencies in the login sequence. I could
</I>&gt;<i> use
</I>&gt;<i> some more people trying out the UserThreadPoolBranch of the repo.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you understand git then you can fetch a more recent version that
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i> just merged against trunk yesterday at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://brianw.terrabox.com/OpenSim/OpenSim.git">http://brianw.terrabox.com/OpenSim/OpenSim.git</A>  as branch UTPBranch
</I>&gt;<i> (or
</I>&gt;<i> was it UserTHreadPool, brain wonky before first coffee)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It replaces the thread per user creation with a dedicated threadpool.
</I>&gt;<i> Some people report one impression, others another, andit works &quot;great&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> for me personally. So more eyes on what it's doign to syetems would be
</I>&gt;<i> appreciated. :)
