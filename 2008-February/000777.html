<PRE>Dear Impalah:

We had been using mono-1.2.4. We are going to be standardizing on mono-1.2.5.1 for a while. We have had touble with mono-1.2.6 and are waiting for mono-1.2.6.1 to hope some of the problems have been fixed. So, for now, mono-1.2.5.1 is the answer.

Charles

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] further db thoughts

Sorry for answering a bit late, I have not much time for development :-(

I'm making tests with NHibernate (a sample data model with several tables for burning test... 20000+ registers). I tested by now in mysql and mssql, both mono and .NET. I think tomorrow I could try sqlite but... a little problem. Seems that the &quot;official&quot; driver is outdated and everybody recommends to use the one shipped with mono (version 1.2.4 and higher).

Is there any restriction for the mono version opensim uses?

Thanks

Yes, as I said at the start, how things play together might take a while to get used to. The lib is supposed to create parameterized dynamic sql, so that bit should be injection-aversive.
 
And, by all means, feel free to find other ways to slice the cake; I put it there for us to extend and modify, in the hope that it could function as a help also for people who want to extend our db definitons with their own need for light-weight persistence.
 
I know my code sample was stenographic at best, but I hope to deliver some working code (ideally, shape, part and group) at the end of this week - I have it on my hard disk, just have to 'clean' it from context-specifics.
 
Best,
/Stefan

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Stefan, It would be motivating if you could provide a sample about how the TribalMedia data framework should work. Could that be done by implementing the very simple asset server as an example ? I propose we would make it work, make tests, comment and try to improve it, then it may serve as a baseline for the other db stuff ?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *doh*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll just post the code; but beware, it doesn't work, it's just to show you how stuff would interact
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Also, the code could probably be cleaner...)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What to look for:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * how the Schema is created and populated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * how the m_keyFieldMapper (that is used to extract primary key from queries) is initialized
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * how the FromReader passes on to FillObject() - the function that will use the Schema to populate the RowMapper (and the PrimitiveBaseShape)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * How the CRUD and CreateRowMapper functions are really just there to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get a cleaner interface for the caller.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a bit concerned about the ability to get SQL injection through the
</I>&gt;<i> process (unless I missed something). We need to either put in filter
</I>&gt;<i> for that, or use the parametrized SQL for the base drivers to let them
</I>&gt;<i> filter that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still wrapping my head around all of it, but I like much of what I'm
