<PRE>IMHO tackling the password authentication might be quite simple:

1) have a separate web service into which you login, and which returns you a
4-digit number, valid for, say, 15 minutes.
2) have a web service to answer the requests from the sims who will supply
the hash from the client
3) have the simulator forward the hash from the client to this service upon
the user login - and get the pass/fail result from this server.

On a first look, this will be reasonably secure, easy to use, simple to
code, and harder to crack than the web-single-sign-on proposal that I heard
in the discussions some time ago.

the last name could be the domain name, and the exact method of the
authentication/URL/whatnot could be stored in a TXT record for that domain.

Users with the higher level of paranoia might have an option on the backend
of selecting a longer one-time-password for the simulator login.

What do you think of such an approach ?

</I>&gt;<i> still doesn't have permissions, so that probably won't be done now. But
</I>&gt;<i> when it has permissions, that's what we will want. This whole idea of

</I>&gt;<i> with virtual worlds; it's a major step *back* from what we got
</I>&gt;<i> accustomed with the Web. We want interoperable ID domains, interoperable
</I>&gt;<i> inventory (storage) domains, gridless and intergrid sim-to-sim TPs,
</I>&gt;<i> external exposure of data for search engines, and all kinds of good old
</I>&gt;<i> web openness, properly ACLed -- that's very clear.
