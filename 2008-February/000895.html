<PRE>Dear Diva,

I am realXtend project manager and we have just started to contribute code
to OpenSim project. One of our key sw components aim to this kind of
authentication and cross-grid functionality. We will make a release of all
of our sw components, including user authentication, at the end of this
month. These components will appear to OpenSim svn even before that.

Only drawback is that our approach is not (at least yet) SL-compatible. We
have also developed our own viewer based on SL Viewer, but with many
enhancements. You might want to check our web site, which was just opened
few hours ago: <A HREF="http://www.realxtend.org.">http://www.realxtend.org.</A>

</I>&gt;<i> We will use passwords, of course, that's how authentications get done
</I>&gt;<i> these days. We'll have to figure out how to handle the MD5 hash if the
</I>&gt;<i> campus authentication service doesn't do it. Of course, better would be
</I>&gt;<i> if the credentials were entered at the site of the authentication
</I>&gt;<i> service, which is how this usually works on the web: you want to login
</I>&gt;<i> to your grades -&gt; you're first redirected to the authentication service
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; you come back to the grades system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, what I really want is to let everyone in, UCI and non-UCI,
</I>&gt;<i> and properly ACL things -- just like what happens on the web. OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> still doesn't have permissions, so that probably won't be done now. But
</I>&gt;<i> when it has permissions, that's what we will want. This whole idea of
</I>&gt;<i> having un-interoperable domains of users, each grid with its own domain,
</I>&gt;<i> is not going to scale to the kinds of things universities want to do
</I>&gt;<i> with virtual worlds; it's a major step *back* from what we got
</I>&gt;<i> accustomed with the Web. We want interoperable ID domains, interoperable
</I>&gt;<i> inventory (storage) domains, gridless and intergrid sim-to-sim TPs,
</I>&gt;<i> external exposure of data for search engines, and all kinds of good old
</I>&gt;<i> web openness, properly ACLed -- that's very clear.
