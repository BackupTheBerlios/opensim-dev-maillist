<PRE>thanks for the reply.
It turned out that by creating a file called .profile in my home area and putting in the framework line I was able to get the server up and running.
 
However, I am still having some issues with the client.  When I try to edit my appearance, the client crashes (using the new 1.9 secondlife client).
 
As a side note, could someone provide some buildings (structures) that I could add to my island?
 
Thank you,
Bob

Hi Bob,

Mac historically has been a bit of a tough platform to work with - from what I heard. I hope there're some folks on the list that might give some more hints... 

I suspect it might be useful to give it first a shot as a standalone region and check if you can run it that way - and then, if you plan to run your region permanently, to connect it to the grid.

(from your description I am not sure how you are running it).

	Help,

	 

	I am sorry to ask, but I have tried to follow all of the instructions on the web site, but I am still having issues.

	 

	 

	I am installing 0.5 on a new Mac pro with 10.5.2.  I was able to download and install the mono package and compile all o f the packages.

	 

	Issues;

	 

	 I cannot find the file .profile that in which the added line was supposed to be included.

	 

	I copied the OpenSim.ini.example over to OpenSim.ini;  I changed the 127.0.0.1 &lt;<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/">http://127.0.0.1/</A>&gt;  address to the exact address of the machine; however, I did not make any other changes.

	 

	I can connect to the server; however, it fails when it tries to make the region connection (sql issue).

	 

	Any help would be appreciated.

	 

	Bob Sanders
