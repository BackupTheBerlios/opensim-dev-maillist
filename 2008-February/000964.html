Get either a commitment from it's original authors to return to active development, or alternatively an informal hand-off of the work to this group. Then perform a systematic audit on this code, as a group. Document it as we go. Explaining how code works to a piece of paper can show up just as many flaws as a trial run. There's the side benefit of generating thorough documentation.&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> In opensim, no one owns any part of the code, everyone is free to work

</I>&gt;<i> work on certain areas. And as for getting a commitment form the packet
</I>&gt;<i> handling original authors to be active again, well the packet handling
</I>&gt;<i> code has been wrote and added to and fixed by numerous people, and
</I>&gt;<i> most are still active. We can't force anyone to work on one piece of

+1.  We're all in this together. :)

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
