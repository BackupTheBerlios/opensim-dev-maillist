<PRE>Early this morning there was (yet another) instance where certain regions
could be readily accessed by some and could not be accessed at all by
others.

This led to an insightfull discussion on IRC this morning, which I will
attach for your convenience.

Here are some high points:

[image: :arrow:] Various users were able to access WP reliably last night
while others were completely unable to do so. The consistent relevant factor
was a high ping time from the affected clients to the region server in
question. A properly executed traceroute revealed that the network fault lay
with level3 networks, between the affected clients and the region server in
question.

[image: :arrow:] recently I was graced with the company of many new
neighbors on the grid. With the new neighbors came complete instability with
respect to my region server. Some of the instabilities were my own doing.
Fixing them did not completely address the problem. A subsequent relocation
to a neighbor-free location on the grid did.

[image: :arrow:] one of our newer contributors has audited much of the
low-level packet handling code and found it to be in want of some
rearchitecting in the interest of efficiency. This is a salient point; if
the communications code upon which the grid relies for region&lt;&gt;region and
client&lt;&gt;region communications is not optimum, we cannot count on operations
to be optimum. This also has profound implications for troubleshooting, as
all diagnostic data arrives via the conduits implemented by this low-level
comms code.

[image: :arrow:] adjacent misconfigured regions have been demonstrated to
have a significant impact on a given region's stability. Something needs to
be done to address this.

I will present some talking points in terms of these roles and their goals.

The set of roles and goals of the OSGrid may be summarized as a brief mission
statement which I characterise as follows:

OSGrid exists as a multirole support operation supporting and conducting
testing pursuant to the development of OpenSim virtual reality/telepresence
software. Further, it exists to provide a free parking service for the
development and testing community, both for pure testing and content
hosting. Finally, OSGrid exists to develop and drive development of
grid-related tools and/or code, whether as freestanding utilities or source
for contribution to the codebase of OpenSim.



Pursuant to fulfillment of these roles, a course of action needs be devised
which facilitates all of these objectives simultaneously. Here is a plan
which seeks to accomplish this. Note that some key points are short term;
others, less so:

[image: :idea:] Packet handling technology critique. Involve directly those
who have worked on this code in the past with those who are interested in
carrying the work forward. Get either a commitment from it's original
authors to return to active development, or alternatively an informal
hand-off of the work to this group. Then perform a systematic audit on this
code, as a group. Document it as we go. Explaining how code works to a piece
of paper can show up just as many flaws as a trial run. There's the side
benefit of generating thorough documentation.

One sequence of events currently in progress with respect to this, is that
several of our commercial contributors are about to introduce a major set of
stability and load balancing patches. This set of patches might well replace
or repair the affected code, so this may in fact become a non-issue.

This does not mean we can afford to sit and wait for them to make the drop.
What we can take immediate action on, is to prepare to profile the
performance impact in quantitative ways once this code has been dropped. In
this interest, ChrisD will be placing some regions alongside mine out in the
open; our intention is to maintain a seperate 'island', where we can
excercise fine-grained control over who our neighbors are (and more
importantly, fine-grained control of the neighbor configuration) for testing
purposes.

We also hope to be able to prove our theory about brokenly configured
adjacent regions. If you bring up a region adjacent to us, we will likely
ask you to move it or remove it ourselves if we are unable to reach you.

[image: :idea:] Set up an automated vetting process for incoming regions on
the grid. Say, submit region xml files via HTTP/POST, and have them
programatically checked for syntactical correctness, geographical
collisions, network reachability, port configuration consistency,
completness of information, etc. before allowing a final connection with
grid services.

This also introduces a logical point for a payment collection/verification
process for that day when we have a salable service, for those who are
interested in providing for-pay grid services at that time.

[image: :idea:] Establish an effective heartbeat mechanism between region
servers and grid server. If the heartbeat goes away, the region table entry
is appropriately updated to reflect the region state, and except for
geographic purposes and region heartbeat response, the region would be
ignored by grid services (as if it were not there). If/when the region
produces new signs of life, it would then be returned to active
participation with grid services. This could be taken a step further with
longterm monitoring of the region heartbeat.

Logic is implied that after some configurable long period without a
heartbeat the region could be made available for purging from the tables
completely, either automatically or with operator intervention. The benefits
in bandwidth and cycles recovered from retry requests and threads locked
while waiting on unresponsive regions would far exceed the relatively minor
hit taken in producing and servicing a heartbeat.


The balance of the material posted here is offered to the group in the
interest of stimulating conversation about these observations. None of this
is authorative, except in the sense that it represents my observations and
what I think can be done about them. I (and others) are eager to hear from
you on these matters to the extent you are willing and able to participate
in resolving them. Note that I dont claim to represent any one else in this
post, but I suspect that my views are somewhat parallel with at least some
in the community.

Please jump in and let us know what you think [image: 8-)]

Cheers!
