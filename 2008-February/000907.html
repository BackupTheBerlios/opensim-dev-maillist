<PRE>Hi all,

First, please be indulgent about my poor english :) You all know how  
french people are bad with foreign languages ...
Thanks in advance.

Well, I'm running OpenSim in StandAlone mode, 3x3 Regions ( as Grid  
mode is so difficult to configure behind a firewall ) ...
Using a home made &quot;Linux From Scratch&quot; box with Mono 1.2.6 ( daily  
snapshot ) ...
The computer is an Athlon64X2 4400+ with 4GB Ram ... ( is it large  
enough ? )

In the past ( before SVN.3335 or something ) when running OpenSim,  
just after the simulator goes Up, the OpenSim.exe process use around  
96 threads and everything works fine,
But, now, I saw that this number of threads reach 118 :(
As I posted in the past in Mantis that Mono under Linux is really bad  
( performances &amp; coredump ) when you reach the limit of 170 threads ...

When I connect 1 user to the sim : Thread count is now reaching : 157
When I connect a 2nd user to the sim : Thread count reach : 200
( in that case : 200 threads used, the sim doesn't crash like in the  
past but I find everything slow ... and my CPU is now 100% use / 7%  
Ram used )

Then, that mean, each time a user is connecting to the Sim, it use  
about 40 threads ...
So, if I like to connect 20 users, I need around 40x20 threads = 800  
threads ...
And I'm not sure at all that Mono could manage that :(

What's you're feeling on that point ?

So, my question is : why not forking a new &quot;OpenSim.exe&quot; process for  
each new connected user ?
Of course it's mostly for the standalone mode ( but the problem is a  
bit the same in Grid Mode )  ...

Maybe it's a simple/stupid idea from me, because I haven't enough  
development skills to help all the people working hard to bring up  
this marvelous simulator.

Please, just let me know your position about it.

Thanks a lot guys for all your dev,

Regards,

Ursula Matova
