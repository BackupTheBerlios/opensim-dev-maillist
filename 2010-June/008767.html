<PRE>Hi folks, I am continuing to do initial tests of 0./7 RC1... and 
wanted to give some feedback.   I am happy to report anything you 
think needs logging in mantis. But some items are probably simple 
issues that Diva and others might be able to point me in the direction of.

I am using Robust.exe -inifile Robust.HG.ini and believe I have the 
.ini files all set up right for my system (baring mistakes of course)

All attempts to get Robust.exe to do the asset data base migrations 
have failed.  I spotted quite a number of things and addressed them 
as I went along.

---------------------------
The documentation suggesting the values for 4 variables in the 
[mysqld] section of the MySQL config file have some issues in them 
(at least for Windows MySQL users).  There was a problem with all 4 
variables or their values as examples. See details at
<A HREF="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-system-variables.html">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-system-variables.html</A> 
It may  be worth They should be something like:

[mysqld]
open-files-limit = 20000                   (add -limit on end of name 
and yes these are hyphens not underscores)
interactive_timeout = 1000000         (drop a 0 as it was beyond 
legal upper range)
wait_timeout = 1000000                 (drop a 0 as it was beyond 
legal upper range)
max_connnections = 2000              (connections plural not connection)

I noted these changes, but left Diva's values in for now until we 
verify these are right at
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7_Release#Before_you_upgrade">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7_Release#Before_you_upgrade</A>

---------------------------

Even with these corrections in place I still get two Cmd time out 
errors on the asset table migrations in Robust.exe after about 40 
seconds.  Note that I was able to do the commands manually in MySQL 
Command Line Client and the commands took roughly 2 minutes and 1 
minute (with 10000 or so assets).  I have no idea how to make 
Robust.exe properly wait for the time required.

------------------------
Note also in the log above typo in one of the INFO messages  at 
2010-06-17 10:26:37,745 &quot;interupt&quot; -&gt; &quot;interrupt&quot;

-----------------------

As I said I manually added in these data base column addition to let 
me get further.
Manually doing the following in MySQL command line client

use opensim;
ALTER TABLE assets ADD COLUMN asset_flags INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE assets ADD COLUMN CreatorID varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT '';

---------------------

I note that in Robust.exe I get this error message early on in the 
logs.... which I have not yet tracked down.

2010-06-18 09:23:41,375 INFO  - OpenSim.Server.OpenSimServer 
[SERVER]: Loading XInventoryServiceInConnector
2010-06-18 09:23:41,375 INFO  - OpenSim.Server.OpenSimServer 
[SERVER]: Failed to load 
OpenSim.Server.Handlers.dll:XInventoryServiceInConnector

Note this was NOT shown in red in the log.  Should it be?  Its noted 
as INFO not an ERROR.

------------------------

After that I have something up and running, and Opensim.ini looks to 
have started.

-------------------------
http_loginform.html  and <A HREF="http://.../?method=regionImage">http://.../?method=regionImage</A> served maps 
on URLs not serving

I tried to look at the region map tiles using the 
<A HREF="http://.../index.php?method=regionImage&lt;UUID">http://.../index.php?method=regionImage&lt;UUID</A>&gt; served maps on a web page...e.g.

<A HREF="http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:9000/index.php?method=regionImagebd09a793eba511dc95ff0800200c9a66">http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:9000/index.php?method=regionImagebd09a793eba511dc95ff0800200c9a66</A>
and the request come sin to the server, but the map fails to be 
generated (yellow warning).


On trying SL Viewer 1.23 with my usual working 0.6.9 login parameters...

&quot;C:\Program Files\SecondLife\SecondLife.exe&quot; -channel &quot;Opensim&quot; 
-loginuri <A HREF="http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002/">http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002/</A> -loginpage 
<A HREF="http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002/?method=login">http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002/?method=login</A>

The splash screen .html file I usually use in 0.6.9 is nt shown, 
though it is present at D:\VW\Opensim\bin\http_loginform.html  as usual.

Map serving to web also not serving images...


<A HREF="http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:9000/index.php?method=regionImagebd09a793eba511dc95ff0800200c9a66">http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:9000/index.php?method=regionImagebd09a793eba511dc95ff0800200c9a66</A>
------------------

I have not understood what port 82 is used for, or how it is meant to 
be used, and I should be set in opensim.ini to use my working Flotsam 
groups handling... but groups and port 82 errors are occurring

Opensim.exe - Opensim.log

... repeated many times....


-----------------------

I also have not got the usual 3 hyperlinked regions put in via 
link-region - they all failed at startup.  Maybe due to using HG 1.5 
and the others have to be the same for it to work?

-----------------------

Okay, I am now logged on as my avatar, and I see all the objects i 
all regions in place, scripts seem to work, etc.  I can move between 
regions via map teleport. My avatar has the expected UUID (as 
verified by touching an object whose script shows that).

I seem to not have a home or last location on login.

The avatar though is &quot;Ruth&quot;, and when I look at the inventory, all 
folders are intact, but there is no content, and I just get &quot;Loading&quot;...&quot;
