<PRE>I made my assumption and asked for clarification because it didn't specifically state what's listed on the Wiki.  Thanks for the reference.  Finding things in the Wiki can be.. ummm. Challenging.  In particular Diva didn't address the 6mos rule and seemed to focus on the GPL.  If I misread I apologize, again its why I asked for clarification.  In the future if the Wiki is authoritative perhaps the best response is to simply reference it as you did.

I asked for clarification because honestly I'd like to be able to contribute and can't with the current restrictions.    It is what it is.

Mike

Mike,

&gt;<i> Diva, your message as worded sounds to me like you
</I>&gt;<i> would accept contributions so long as there were no
</I>&gt;<i> GPL licensed code in the submission.
</I>
Not sure what you read (or misunderstood), or where you would have derived that conclusion from, but from what I just read from Diva's previous post, it seems to be that you're completely wrong in your assumption.  Where did you draw that conclusion from?  I don't think Diva said ANYTHING like that in her post.
