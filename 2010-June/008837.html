<PRE>I have performed several teleports and returns home now between 
virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002 and dev.germangrid.de:8002

I have done it fine in about 25% of cases, but often it starts to 
load the foreign grid region, and then it logs the user out of the 
viewer thew viewer giving you the option to look at IMs/chat before 
quitting.  After that on login attempts it times out after showing 
&quot;connecting to region&quot; and says it cannot teleport to the 
location.  Tryig with another avatar I get through first time, then 
after a similar log off, I get the same behavior of it not the 
allowing further teleports without timing out.

But I cannot see a Suitcase folder in my inventory.  Was one meant to 
have been created automatically?  If so, that does not seem to be 
working yet in 0.7 RC1.

Am I also right to believe that if inventory is opened, all FOLDERs 
wlil show to the foregn sim/grid, but no contents will show unless 
the specific home inventory folders are actually opened.  So, if you 
ONLY open the new Suitcase folder its contents will be all that are shared?
