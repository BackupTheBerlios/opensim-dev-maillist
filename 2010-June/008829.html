<PRE>Yep, this was a problem in my merge of 0.6.9 sections into the 0.7 
opensim.ini.example base.  I had not spotted the change of variable 
name needed.  I will make a note in the 0.7 upgrade Wiki to help others.

I have a working flotsam groups setup in my test 0.7 system 
now.  Thanks Michael and Jor31.

 &gt;&gt; That is good to hear. Then we can move past this &quot;disable Simian
 &gt;&gt; completely&quot; issue now.

 &gt;&gt; The Simian developers apparently don't test with Robust at all. So
 &gt;&gt; they don't catch bugs where Simian is not properly disabled.
 &gt;
 &gt; Groups has been tested and works perfectly well with .69 -- and the last
 &gt; time it was tested with the .7 branch it worked just fine.

Jor3l Boa wrote:
 &gt;&gt;&gt; ... Groups were
 &gt; refactored to use the same GroupsServerURI configuration variable for
 &gt; both the Simian and the XmlRpc Groups connectors.
 &gt;
 &gt; This caused some difficulty with existing configurations with users of
 &gt; .69 -- it was requested that any patches to .69 branch not require
 &gt; changes to users existing configurations, so a fix was applied to that
 &gt; branch that allows the .69 version of the xmlrpc groups connector to use
 &gt; the old (XmlRpcServiceURL) or new (GroupsServerURI) configuration variable.
 &gt;
 &gt; Anyone using .7 / master/HEAD -- will need to switch from the old
 &gt; variable name to the new variable name, as specified in the
 &gt; OpenSim.ini.example file.
