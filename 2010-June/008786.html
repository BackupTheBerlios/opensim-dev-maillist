<PRE>Actually, that code is on my list. However, since there is such a
hue and cry over the new driver, I have refrained from putting into
master, since that would &quot;freeze&quot; the new driver in place.

Although I'm a proponent of forward motion, we MAY have to roll back
the driver and migration change. I really want to avoid that, but
until that issue is resolved, I just can't commit any code that
builds on it.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello Diva,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It was me who put the updated MySql driver into the project, so I'm
</I>&gt;<i> the one to kick for the mess.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  The reasons were:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (a) Yes, the ability to *define* multi-statement stored procs. MySQL has
</I>&gt;<i> a rather hairy way to switch DELIMITER while defining an SP, so
</I>&gt;<i> defining anything with a ';' inside was either impossible or very tricky
</I>&gt;<i> with the previous driver.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You are also correct that stored procs are NOT used currently, however
</I>&gt;<i> they can be used to provide &quot;fast&quot; tracking of asset access times,
</I>&gt;<i> which, as I understand, is required for cleaning up unused assets and
</I>&gt;<i> preventing the database from growing infinitely. The relevant code is
</I>&gt;<i> ready, tested and described by me somewhere on Mantis, with a link to
</I>&gt;<i> github, but I don't think anybody has bothered to review / merge it
</I>&gt;<i> (yet).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The last time I looked, the access tracking functionality was
</I>&gt;<i> commented out in the asset store code, because sending an UPDATE after
</I>&gt;<i> each asset fetch just kills the performance (like 10 times slower).
</I>&gt;<i> The solution based on stored procs has a performance penalty of about
</I>&gt;<i> 10-15%.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can re-post the link to Mantis where this approach is described, if
</I>&gt;<i> anybody is interested.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (b) the less important reason is just to keep up with the most recent
</I>&gt;<i> versions of the driver.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Updating the driver also involved some changes in the stores to
</I>&gt;<i> correctly convert between values returned/accepted by the driver and
</I>&gt;<i> UUIDs in the code. The reason is that the new driver implicitly
</I>&gt;<i> converts CHAR(36), returning it as Guid (rather than a string). With
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;Old Guids&quot; config var, the driver would instead convert
</I>&gt;<i> BINARY(16) to Guid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With the new driver and the corresponding code changes in place, the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Old Guids&quot; config var should NOT be used.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
