<PRE>I don't know where in my message you read that. The &quot;no risks&quot; rule 
couldn't be clearer.

The issue is one of being exposed to the concrete algorithms of the 
viewer and then writing server-side code specifically for them. It's not 
so much intellectual property -- as far as I know, nothing in the viewer 
is patented. But even if something is patented, that would not be all we 
need to worry about. The issue is learning from the viewer code. 
Learning from code is a grey area of open source licensing. In radical 
interpretations, learning from the code and then writing code for what 
you've learned makes that new code a &quot;derived work&quot;.

So in that worst case scenario, the grief would be that OpenSim would be 
forced to change into a GPL license. We don't want that.

</I>&gt;<i> The issue here is not BSD+GPL licenses in general, although that's 
</I>&gt;<i> also an issue to worry about; the issue we most vocally warn people 
</I>&gt;<i> about is very specific to OpenSim and Second Life. OpenSim has been 
</I>&gt;<i> made legally possible due to the generosity of Linden Lab's publishing 
</I>&gt;<i> their protocols by means of some public documentation and, yes, open 
</I>&gt;<i> sourcing the client [under GPL]. So far, we have had the passive and, 
</I>&gt;<i> at points, active support of Linden Lab in developing OpenSim. But, as 
</I>&gt;<i> we all know, Linden Lab is a relatively unpredictable company; at any 
</I>&gt;<i> point, it could be acquired by another company who is less 
</I>&gt;<i> enthusiastic about a free BSD open source server side to their client. 
</I>&gt;<i> In the absolute worst case scenario, that other company could cause us 
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of grief if OpenSim includes code directly derived from GPL'ed 
</I>&gt;<i> viewer code. (I don't want to start a rhetorical discussion about 
</I>&gt;<i> this; that's just the worst case scenario, period.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hence, the &quot;no risks&quot; rule. We do not take patches from anyone who is 
</I>&gt;<i> actively involved in the development of viewers from the LL viewer family.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If, however, you are talking about your own modules that aren't part 
</I>&gt;<i> of the official OpenSim distribution, then OpenSim has no say about it 
</I>&gt;<i> -- do whatever you want. No one here is in a position to give legal 
</I>&gt;<i> advice.
