<PRE>The long run times can't be avoided. MySQL alter table is
excruciatingly slow with the huge BLOBs opensim uses.

We have to live with it.

I think there may be middle road between rollback and error. I'll
look at it.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello Diva,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't looked how the timeouts are implemented in the driver,
</I>&gt;<i> the code I added/modified doesn't do anything about them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MySqlScript class is ONLY needed if a proc needs to be defined.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, the common Migration class can be used for mySQL just as
</I>&gt;<i> for all other DBs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure the regular MySqlCommand would work any
</I>&gt;<i> better with huge timeouts than MySqlScript.  If the timeout can be
</I>&gt;<i> extended beyond the &quot;default default&quot; of 30 sec but then hits a
</I>&gt;<i> limit, it sounds to me more like some server-side limitation
</I>&gt;<i> then something in MySqlScript.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can look at the driver sources, but not today.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Re rolling back to the old driver:  the code changes that accompanied
</I>&gt;<i> the driver update can be found in r/12794, r/12795.  The converter
</I>&gt;<i> function in DBGuids.cs is supposed to convert between UUIDs and the
</I>&gt;<i> DB-specific representation more or less regardless of what the driver
</I>&gt;<i> returns (string or Guid). So it should be possible to rollback the
</I>&gt;<i> driver (or use &quot;OldGuids&quot; var) without actually touching the code.
</I>&gt;<i> MySqlMigration would have to be removed, though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder what could make the migration run so slow, may be it would
</I>&gt;<i> make sense to look into the migration scripts and try to optimize them
</I>&gt;<i> somehow (add/remove some indexes or whatever).  Most of the migration stuff is
</I>&gt;<i> just about adding/changing columns and for all I know a server should be
</I>&gt;<i> able to process quite a lot of data in 1 hour (like hundreds of
</I>&gt;<i> thousands rows).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can Frank provide some details on what parts of the migration are
</I>&gt;<i> especially slow?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When people start migrating their DBs to 0.7, it would be nice to make
</I>&gt;<i> sure the scripts are reasonably efficient.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; Since you were the one who wrote the newly introduced
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; MySqlMigrations class, which uses the MySqlScript class, can you
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; please explain how we can get around the issue that Frank is
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; talking about? It looks like the MySqlScript class has some
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; hardcoded timeouts. Frank says that we might be able to specify a
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; timeout between 0 and 1 hour, but not more. Some DB migrations,
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; especially assets, might take more than 1 hour.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; I'm really considering rolling back to using the old driver
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; because this one is causing too much grief and confusion at this
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; critical time when we want things to be stable.
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; Any light on this new driver, especially its limitations/bugs,
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; and how we can overcome them, would be very much appreciated so
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; that we can try to continue to use it in dev code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; Thanks.

</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; 0.6.9 to 0.7.0. The problem seems to be that the default command
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; timeout value for processing a sql statement with this class is 30
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; seconds, which is far to short to alter a table inserting a column
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; when there are hundreds of thousands of rows in that table.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; In researching this it appears that the devart version of the new
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; MySql.data.dll has a version of the MysqlScript which allows you
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; to set the command timeout programmatically, however the mysql
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; version of this library does not have this property available. As
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; far as I could see there is currently no way to set the command
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; timeout. So, it would appear that automatic migrations are doomed
</I>&gt;<i> DC&gt; to fail in any case where they take more than 30 seconds.
