Well, that's not exactly true that you don't have a say, since 2 core 
devs are your employees :)

But wrt to stabilization, as I said, those interfaces are the main 
contract. Notice that these interfaces didn't exist, as such, before. 
Now they do. Before now, no one here could point to a piece of the code 
base and tell you &quot;hey, here's the contract&quot;. Now we can. I'm hoping 
that, after some minor clean-ups (exception: IInventoryService needs a 
major cleanup) those interfaces will freeze. I'd be very surprised if 
those interfaces will go through major changes after 0.7. That's my word 
only, I don't speak for the entire project, but, really, I'd be *very* 
surprised.
