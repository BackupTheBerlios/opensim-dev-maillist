<PRE>Thanks for this - it is a helpful clarification. I rarely mean  
criticism in a personal way so appreciate the background.

I have looked at the work involved and there is quite a lot. I  
appreciate where Mic is coming from as I have the same dilemma ( with  
even fewer resources than Intel!).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, some aspects are more settled than others.
</I>&gt;<i> First, let me point out where this comes from, so that you and others
</I>&gt;<i> can understand better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Up to recently, there was no such thing as  
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.Services.Interfaces,
</I>&gt;<i> nor the companions OpenSim.Services.Connectors and
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.Server.Handlers. The interaction between the simulator and the
</I>&gt;<i> resource services, and among the resource services themselves, was a
</I>&gt;<i> mess. I don't mean it in a criticizing attitude, early-stage code is
</I>&gt;<i> usually a mess. The broad stokes were there, and were really good, but
</I>&gt;<i> the details were a complete mess. Simple questions like &quot;what handlers
</I>&gt;<i> are there?&quot; or &quot;what are the resource service interfaces?&quot; were a
</I>&gt;<i> challenge to answer, interfaces and handlers were spread all over the
</I>&gt;<i> code, special cases were pervasive, classes were being used directly
</I>&gt;<i> instead of interfaces, etc. The user services, in particular, were a
</I>&gt;<i> nightmare, with duplication running rampant because of &quot;standalone vs
</I>&gt;<i> grid mode&quot;, and the code being on the verge of bipolar disorder.  
</I>&gt;<i> Users,
</I>&gt;<i> agents and avatars were being used interchangeably, with no conceptual
</I>&gt;<i> distinction, misnomers everywhere, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This refactoring's main goal is to depart from that chaotic mess and  
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> instill order in the code base. It is primarily a *refactoring*,  
</I>&gt;<i> meaning
</I>&gt;<i> that code has moved from one namespace to another, but it is also a
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite -- because in the process of revisiting the code it was clear
</I>&gt;<i> that things should be done better than they were being done. In
</I>&gt;<i> particular, harmful hard-coded instantiations of classes were replaced
</I>&gt;<i> by dynamic loading and instantiation. The core of this is
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.Server.Base.Utils.LoadPlugin -- this is the core of the ROBUST
</I>&gt;<i> model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having said that, let me now explain how people who plan to extend
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim should be looking at it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main &quot;contract&quot; between the core code and developers of resource
</I>&gt;<i> services is the collection of interfaces in  
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.Services.Interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i> This is what the simulators call, can't get around hard-coded calls to
</I>&gt;<i> those interfaces. Those interfaces will stabilize very quickly. Most  
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> them are stable already, with the notable exception of  
</I>&gt;<i> IInventoryService
</I>&gt;<i> which still needs love. But all others will be stable at 0.7. Now is  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> right time for people to look at those interfaces and send feedback
</I>&gt;<i> about which things you think are missing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The next level of reuse is the code in OpenSim.Services.Connectors and
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.Server.Handlers. This code is less important than the
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces, because it's invisible to the simulators, therefore ppl
</I>&gt;<i> should be more careful about relying on it. This is quite an important
</I>&gt;<i> point that I don't think many people grasp yet, so let me explain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In most systems, the network protocols are fixed. People go to great
</I>&gt;<i> lengths discussing them ad-nauseum in meetings and committees, to  
</I>&gt;<i> settle
</I>&gt;<i> on the right data formats, the right data, etc. NOT HERE. The network
</I>&gt;<i> protocols in OpenSim are now dynamically loaded, and therefore
</I>&gt;<i> replaceable. There is no such thing as *the* network protocol between
</I>&gt;<i> the simulator and, say, the asset server. There can be many -- you can
</I>&gt;<i> roll your own. There are reference implementations in the core
</I>&gt;<i> distribution, but that's exactly what they are: reference
</I>&gt;<i> implementations, they are not fixed protocols. As such, people  
</I>&gt;<i> should be
</I>&gt;<i> careful about relying on those reference implementations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, to sum it up: the main contract is OpenSim.Services.Interfaces and
</I>&gt;<i> those are going to be stable very soon. The level right under it,
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.Server.Handlers and OpenSim.Services.Connectors can also be
</I>&gt;<i> relied upon but it's less stable. I'm still not happy with many of
</I>&gt;<i> those, so they will change after 0.7. People who don't want to put up
</I>&gt;<i> with these changes may want to roll their own network protocols.
