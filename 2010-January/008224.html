I think this is definitely a start, and better than nothing. I know
myself, the way I teach myself a code base sometimes is to start
documenting it. Moreover I find it in line with an open  source
project that people build a skeleton for collaborative fleshing-in.

Please do go ahead with creating the skeleton as soon you have the
time, as this helps out down-stream projects like reX quite immensely
in planning and organizing their work.

What I'd like to see:
1. TOC
2. Introductions to each chapter
3. A sentence or two with what you want to say, and links to the relevant code
4. A couple paragraphs more for the bigger bits, like the meaning
behind the Interfaces, or how robust works

Basically enough of a seed to let other people come in and flesh out
and grow the documentation. If it's just an empty place-holder,
there's no purchase for the thing to grow.

Cheers,

&gt;<i> start figuring out what to write in there. Speaking for myself, I have
</I>&gt;<i> no time for both coding/testing and heavy-duty documentation. It's not
</I>&gt;<i> that I don't think documentation is not important -- it is -- it's just
</I>&gt;<i> lack of time. Writing good documentation takes as much time as writing
</I>&gt;<i> code. If someone here really wants to help the project, doesn't code but
</I>&gt;<i> writes English well... consider volunteering as a documenter! -- it's
</I>&gt;<i> fun, you get to try OpenSim in all sorts of modes, so that you know how
</I>&gt;<i> it works and what to write, and you also get to pick on core devs'
</I>&gt;<i> brains. I know for a fact that many of you here are already advanced
</I>&gt;<i> enough in OpenSim configuration and testing that you could do this very
</I>&gt;<i> effectively...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, if I had a say in it, my preference would be to do the bulk of
</I>&gt;<i> the documentation effort between 0.7 and 1.0. After 0.7 gets tagged, and
</I>&gt;<i> if no one beats me to it, I'll do a draft of the TOC, and then ppl will
</I>&gt;<i> have a better idea of what's needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (FYI, here are the pieces currently about ROBUST, but this needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> revised, anyway.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;&gt; There is only one thing I really miss for making this: the interfaces
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;&gt; between simultator-&gt;UGAIM are not clearly documented and we have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;&gt; navigate into code to konow what we have to do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; I have pointed to the code, because that's all there is at the moment,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; and it's not even finished. That is not to say that that's all there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; ever will be. Documentation is in the near future, at least for me, as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; something that will be increasingly important for the project, critical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; even. I'm not sure core devs can do it alone, though -- in fact, I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; pretty sure we can't. I think we need to organize this community of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; users-developers much better than we have been doing before to produce
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &quot;The OpenSim Guide.&quot; It can't be a free-for-all, anarchic, design-free
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; wiki like we have been having so far (this is my opinion only, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; doesn't represent any official position of the core devs, but I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; sticking to it). We need leaders (i.e. &quot;Wikipedia admins&quot;). Personally I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; would love to see the emergence of a group of people here who would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; become the &quot;core documenters&quot;. Those people would work very closely with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; core devs in order to &quot;extract&quot; the knowledge out of our heads and into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; documentation.
