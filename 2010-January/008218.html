I have pointed to the code, because that's all there is at the moment, 
and it's not even finished. That is not to say that that's all there 
ever will be. Documentation is in the near future, at least for me, as 
something that will be increasingly important for the project, critical 
even. I'm not sure core devs can do it alone, though -- in fact, I'm 
pretty sure we can't. I think we need to organize this community of 
users-developers much better than we have been doing before to produce 
&quot;The OpenSim Guide.&quot; It can't be a free-for-all, anarchic, design-free 
wiki like we have been having so far (this is my opinion only, and 
doesn't represent any official position of the core devs, but I'm 
sticking to it). We need leaders (i.e. &quot;Wikipedia admins&quot;). Personally I 
would love to see the emergence of a group of people here who would 
become the &quot;core documenters&quot;. Those people would work very closely with 
core devs in order to &quot;extract&quot; the knowledge out of our heads and into 
documentation.
