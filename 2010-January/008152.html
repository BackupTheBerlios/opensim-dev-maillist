<PRE>Diva,

To be honest, I don't think Sqlite should be a database type that we
(OpenSim) should keep alive in the project,

Setting up a simple MySQL server is made easier these days with products
like Xampp and others.

I would call for a vote to exclude Sqlite from the code.

At this moment, the most working Opensim database implementations are MySQL
and MSSQL

Nhibernate can be used for any of the other database servers that exists
(but i know that there's no one maintaining Nhibernate)

&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just an quick message to let you know about the status of the
</I>&gt;<i> refactoring, and to ask for help in some parts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Between Christmas and now, Melanie and I have re-engineered the way that
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim handles users, agents, and avatars, and the persistent data
</I>&gt;<i> associated with all of these. This is the final push on the refactoring
</I>&gt;<i> (and improvement) work that started back in May. This last piece of the
</I>&gt;<i> work is being done in the branch presence-refactor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are several new services that correspond to breaking up the user
</I>&gt;<i> server into smaller pieces, i.e. things that the user server already did
</I>&gt;<i> but in very awkward manner. Namely: user accounts (it's just that,
</I>&gt;<i> accounts), authentication (manages passwords, auth tokens and the like),
</I>&gt;<i> presence (knows where agents are), avatar (manages the 'carcass') and
</I>&gt;<i> friends (social net basics). All of these have been made fairly generic,
</I>&gt;<i> and this will enable a whole new level of extending OpenSim. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, strings are used in important identifiers instead of UUIDs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, what was previously known as &quot;Interregion Comms&quot; (Local
</I>&gt;<i> and REST) is now a simulation service provided by the sims. This last
</I>&gt;<i> service makes agent transfers consistent throughout their existence --
</I>&gt;<i> login and TPs -- and allows for future alternative ways of driving agents.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ETA on merging this with master branch is next weekend. I think we're on
</I>&gt;<i> track to have OpenSim 0.7 sometime in January. This will also allow us
</I>&gt;<i> to start taking security seriously right after 0.7 is tagged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I encourage you to check out the branch and, at least, look through
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.Services.Interfaces, which now tell the story quite well. The
</I>&gt;<i> really brave can try it out on test grids/standalones. (Please use test
</I>&gt;<i> grids/DBs only for the time being!) Notice the configuration files which
</I>&gt;<i> now have a lot more in them. NOTE: only works for MySQL at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This leads me to the asking-for-help part. The DB schema has changed
</I>&gt;<i> substantially. We have been doing this with MySql. We need help to make
</I>&gt;<i> the same changes to SQLite and MSSQL, if these are to be supported from
</I>&gt;<i> here on. I know we can count on StrawberryFride to update the MSSQL
</I>&gt;<i> connector. However, for SQLite... it has been falling through the
</I>&gt;<i> cracks. There is already a show-stopper bug in it that makes the SQLite
</I>&gt;<i> connector not work with mono 2.4.3 and higher
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=4463">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=4463</A>). Unless someone steps
</I>&gt;<i> in and takes care of the SQLite connector, I'm afraid it will go the way
</I>&gt;<i> of the dinosaurs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Diva / Canto
