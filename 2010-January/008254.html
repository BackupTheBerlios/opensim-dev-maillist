<PRE>Grid mode. Connected to SciSim. Thanks to some help from Brian, we put the
Yellowstone National Park terrain on it today. I think Brian said it works
out to about a 1:10 scale. With the far view distance its pretty impressive
(terrain textures are borked). The performance is terrible, but good enough
to look around some. Even a completely empty region consumes resources and
1000 of them consume a LOT of resources. If you come over to sciencesim,
look for &quot;geography11 00&quot;. I'll probably be restarting the regions to get
the map tiles updated &amp; i'm not making any promises to keep it up very long.
But it does make for a very neat demonstration and its been a very useful
experiment.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is just fyi... and a very positive comment about how far opensim has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come in recent months!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as part of sizing the hw requirements for a mirror world project we're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exploring... we wanted to do some scalability tests on the capacity of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individual simulators in terms of the total number of regions. we wanted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> baseline numbers that focus on just the most simple region configuration: a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely empty region with default terrain. that is... this is JUST
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simulator overhead.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all tests are done on one of our blades... dual proc, quad core with 16G
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ram running 64bit ubuntu. mono 2.6. and the tests are hosting 1024 regions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a 32x32 grid. the simulator configuration was our standard sciencesim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> config (XEngine, ODE, groups, wind, sun, etc).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the first configuration ran all 1024 regions in *one* simulator. i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> honestly figured this would crash quickly. it didn't. we managed to get all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1024 regions created and running well enough to walk around. it did take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> almost 8 hours to start. the first couple regions were created in 1-2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seconds each. by the end, it was taking 4-5 minutes per region. clearly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is something quadratic in there (stop using linear lists, they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evil! :-). but it could have been the mono garbage collector. who knows...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not sure its worth too much investigation because i can't imagine ever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> running a config like this for real. the simulator did crash when we opened
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the map in the viewer. the crash was caused because we ran out of sockets.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while it was running, the simulator used just over 10G of ram and was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> running at about 700% CPU utilization (kind of scary to see load averages in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the 900 range!).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the second configuration ran 16 simulators each with 64 regions. startup
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> took about 30 minutes (each of the 16 simulators avoided the quadratic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;knee&quot; we hit with the one big simulator). consumed about 11G of memory and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was again consuming essentially all cycles on the machine (completely idle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regions aren't very idle). all 16 simulators died just after startup with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;too many open files&quot; error. not sure what caused it, but all of them died
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> loading the same terrain dll as part of some wildcard function looking for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dlls. that one is an interesting bug.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the final configuration and the one we're shooting for in the short term
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> runs 16 simulators, each with an 8x8 megaregion. again startup was around 40
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minutes. we might be able to cut that time down by starting all 16
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simulators simultaneously rather than 4 at a time. i really just wanted to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make sure that some of the spikes we see in startup didn't cause failures
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (some race condition causes all threads to consume maximum processor cycles
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> randomly on startup right now). and, well... it just worked. i figured the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viewer would die horribly (it can't handle 250K &quot;real&quot; prims very well) but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it survived just fine. turn off far clip with 8x8 megaregions providing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> neighbors and you are &quot;capable&quot; of contacting simulators in a 24x24 region
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> range!. the view is pretty cool though it seems to not go beyond 12x12. :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there are a bunch of problems (like you can't see the terrain in the region
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you're standing in)... but there are a LOT of little humps of terrain in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> view. oh... and it takes a lot of patience to get everything loaded.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so... the conclusion... this opensim thing is pretty amazing! good work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everyone.
