<PRE>The interfaces have always existed. They were undocumented &amp; scattered
across files, but you can't have a distributed system without interfaces.
What you've done is make them &quot;less&quot; internal, slightly better documented,
and moved to a single set of files (and improved them). It's a commitment to
a stable set of well-understood interfaces that makes extensibility possible
(or more accurately... &quot;cost-effective&quot;). Whether they're in an I* file is
mostly a matter of convenience.

BTW... this is not a complaint about the work that is being done. Or about
the refactoring. This is good stuff. And a commitment to treating them like
real, persistent interfaces is the next step.

</I>&gt;<i> only, I don't speak for the entire project, but, really, I'd be *very*
