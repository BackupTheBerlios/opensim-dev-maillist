Thanks for the update. Diva.  I would like to see at least a 2 week gap after the work is in master 
before creating a 0.7.0-post-fixes branch.  As there's going to be some code upheaval shortly 
afterwards I think we should try to ensure that 0.7 isn't any worse than our previous releases. This 
would mean that actually tagging 0.7 would follow some time after the branch to allow for some 
degree of testing.

Could I ask what is being done about the message service?  This is still in its pre-ROBUST form and 
I don't think that we can tag 0.7 without converting this service.

I have a preference for retaining sqlite but unfortunately I don't have the time to fix it up.  If 
no one can step up then maybe it has to be put into deep freeze.
