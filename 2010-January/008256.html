Grid mode. Connected to SciSim. Thanks to some help from Brian, we put the
Yellowstone National Park terrain on it today. I think Brian said it works
out to about a 1:10 scale. With the far view distance its pretty impressive
(terrain textures are borked). The performance is terrible, but good enough
to look around some. Even a completely empty region consumes resources and
1000 of them consume a LOT of resources. If you come over to sciencesim,
look for &quot;geography11 00&quot;. I'll probably be restarting the regions to get
the map tiles updated &amp; i'm not making any promises to keep it up very long.
But it does make for a very neat demonstration and its been a very useful
experiment.

Just a stupid silly question: standalone or grid mode? If grid: where were
the ugaim servers? Same machine?

And a comment: 1024 regions? 8 hours for booting? Weird!

this is just fyi... and a very positive comment about how far opensim has
come in recent months!

as part of sizing the hw requirements for a mirror world project we're
exploring... we wanted to do some scalability tests on the capacity of
individual simulators in terms of the total number of regions. we wanted
baseline numbers that focus on just the most simple region configuration: a
completely empty region with default terrain. that is... this is JUST
simulator overhead.

all tests are done on one of our blades... dual proc, quad core with 16G ram
running 64bit ubuntu. mono 2.6. and the tests are hosting 1024 regions in a
32x32 grid. the simulator configuration was our standard sciencesim config
(XEngine, ODE, groups, wind, sun, etc). 

the first configuration ran all 1024 regions in *one* simulator. i honestly
figured this would crash quickly. it didn't. we managed to get all 1024
regions created and running well enough to walk around. it did take almost 8
hours to start. the first couple regions were created in 1-2 seconds each.
by the end, it was taking 4-5 minutes per region. clearly there is something
quadratic in there (stop using linear lists, they are evil! :-). but it
could have been the mono garbage collector. who knows... not sure its worth
too much investigation because i can't imagine ever running a config like
this for real. the simulator did crash when we opened the map in the viewer.
the crash was caused because we ran out of sockets. while it was running,
the simulator used just over 10G of ram and was running at about 700% CPU
utilization (kind of scary to see load averages in the 900 range!). 

the second configuration ran 16 simulators each with 64 regions. startup
took about 30 minutes (each of the 16 simulators avoided the quadratic
&quot;knee&quot; we hit with the one big simulator). consumed about 11G of memory and
was again consuming essentially all cycles on the machine (completely idle
regions aren't very idle). all 16 simulators died just after startup with a
&quot;too many open files&quot; error. not sure what caused it, but all of them died
loading the same terrain dll as part of some wildcard function looking for
dlls. that one is an interesting bug. 

the final configuration and the one we're shooting for in the short term
runs 16 simulators, each with an 8x8 megaregion. again startup was around 40
minutes. we might be able to cut that time down by starting all 16
simulators simultaneously rather than 4 at a time. i really just wanted to
make sure that some of the spikes we see in startup didn't cause failures
(some race condition causes all threads to consume maximum processor cycles
randomly on startup right now). and, well... it just worked. i figured the
viewer would die horribly (it can't handle 250K &quot;real&quot; prims very well) but
it survived just fine. turn off far clip with 8x8 megaregions providing
neighbors and you are &quot;capable&quot; of contacting simulators in a 24x24 region
range!. the view is pretty cool though it seems to not go beyond 12x12. :-)
there are a bunch of problems (like you can't see the terrain in the region
you're standing in)... but there are a LOT of little humps of terrain in
view. oh... and it takes a lot of patience to get everything loaded.

so... the conclusion... this opensim thing is pretty amazing! good work
everyone.
