Simple: the messaging server will disappear :)
It was never a messaging server in the first place. It was a presence  
server wannabe: it was only there to track the location of agents.  
Messaging itself is p2p, not centralized. Yeah, another one of the  
early misnomers that led to generalized confusion :)

The IM region module that does the p2p IM-ing will stay more or less  
unchanged, except that it queries the new presence service instead.  
Mel and I had a conversation yesterday about making the p2p connectors/ 
handlers in it explicit and visible out of the Region namespace like  
all other connectors/handlers, but she convinced me that we shouldn't  
touch it until we're ready to rewrite it completely. Probably won't  
happen for 0.7.
