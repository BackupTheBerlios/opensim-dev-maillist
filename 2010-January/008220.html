<PRE>It's there, but it's scattered and incomplete, as everything else.
One of us will have to start this effort, but there is no way that core 
devs alone will be able to put the bulk of the documentation together. 
We can, for example, start with the Table of Contents, write the 
introductory parts, but then some volunteers will have to step up and 
start figuring out what to write in there. Speaking for myself, I have 
no time for both coding/testing and heavy-duty documentation. It's not 
that I don't think documentation is not important -- it is -- it's just 
lack of time. Writing good documentation takes as much time as writing 
code. If someone here really wants to help the project, doesn't code but 
writes English well... consider volunteering as a documenter! -- it's 
fun, you get to try OpenSim in all sorts of modes, so that you know how 
it works and what to write, and you also get to pick on core devs' 
brains. I know for a fact that many of you here are already advanced 
enough in OpenSim configuration and testing that you could do this very 
effectively...

Anyway, if I had a say in it, my preference would be to do the bulk of 
the documentation effort between 0.7 and 1.0. After 0.7 gets tagged, and 
if no one beats me to it, I'll do a draft of the TOC, and then ppl will 
have a better idea of what's needed.

(FYI, here are the pieces currently about ROBUST, but this needs to be 
revised, anyway.

</I>&gt;<i>     doesn't represent any official position of the core devs, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i>     sticking to it). We need leaders (i.e. &quot;Wikipedia admins&quot;). Personally I
</I>&gt;<i>     would love to see the emergence of a group of people here who would
</I>&gt;<i>     become the &quot;core documenters&quot;. Those people would work very closely with
</I>&gt;<i>     core devs in order to &quot;extract&quot; the knowledge out of our heads and into
</I>&gt;<i>     documentation.
