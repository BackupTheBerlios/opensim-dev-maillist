<PRE>I'd like to find out what it takes to become one of the &quot;core documenters&quot;
that Diva describes on January 9:

&quot;I have pointed to the code, because that's all there is at the moment,
and it's not even finished. That is not to say that that's all there
ever will be. Documentation is in the near future, at least for me, as
something that will be increasingly important for the project, critical
even. I'm not sure core devs can do it alone, though -- in fact, I'm
pretty sure we can't. I think we need to organize this community of
users-developers much better than we have been doing before to produce
&quot;The OpenSim Guide.&quot; It can't be a free-for-all, anarchic, design-free
wiki like we have been having so far (this is my opinion only, and
doesn't represent any official position of the core devs, but I'm
sticking to it). We need leaders (i.e. &quot;Wikipedia admins&quot;). Personally I
would love to see the emergence of a group of people here who would
become the &quot;core documenters&quot;. Those people would work very closely with
core devs in order to &quot;extract&quot; the knowledge out of our heads and into
documentation.&quot;


I am an experienced programmer, and I would like to help out with the
development project.  Taking on a documentation task seems like a reasonable
way to become more familiar with the whole environment and find the role
(possibly as a continuing documenter) that most benefits the project.  I
suspect that my impulse is not unique.  What concrete steps can I take to
help get the ball rolling?
