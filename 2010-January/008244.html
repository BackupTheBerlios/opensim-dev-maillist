<PRE>An FYI on the progress of the presence-refactor branch.

Everything has been rewritten in the new style, and things are working. 
The branch has been in testing for the past week, and it's nice to see 
some people not being afraid to check that branch out and have a go at it.

The merge with master hasn't happened yet, because of two and a half 
outstanding issues: (1) the friends feature hasn't been redone, 
therefore friends don't work in the branch yet; (2) SQLite, same; (0.5) 
HG is still in the process of being redone, it doesn't completely work 
in the branch yet.

HG is only 0.5-an-issue because I don't hold the merge back on account 
of HG not working, and I don't think anyone does either; it can be fixed 
after the merge and before 0.7 is tagged. However, the other two, 
especially SQLite, seem to worry people a lot, including Melanie who 
wants to take care of it before the merge happens.

For now, it would be great if people who can do it on their own, check 
the branch out and test things  (on test DBs only please!).
If anyone is in a hurry, help with SQLite and Friends would be most 
welcome, so that we get the merge done sooner. Melanie probably won't do 
it before next week.
