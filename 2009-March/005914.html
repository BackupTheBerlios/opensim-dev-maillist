<PRE>Currently SL is rife with scripts that use ugly expensive workarounds
to accomplish many tasks. This is the norm, not the exception due to
LSL being rather restrictive in some regards with what appears in some
cases to be arbitrary decisions of its designers.

We see this in scenarios ranging from sailboats where every boat in a
regatta has to have it's own script to calculate current wind, in
terrain shapers that must use ugly LSL workarounds for terraforming
rented land, in scripts that &quot;chat things at you&quot; that you then have
to copy/paste into notecards, or the xyText method of using specially
shaped prims and bunches of textures to create the illusion of &quot;text
on a prim object.&quot;

One of the wonderful features of OSSL is that we can rectify these
ugly problems by providing elegant, simple and efficient functions for
scripts to use.

In each of those cases, there are well known established (albeit ugly
&amp; inefficient) ways of accomplishing the script creator's goals.  I
would like to instead encourage the use of OSSL functions to achieve
many of the same goals.  There are a small number of roadblocks to
accomplish this however, all of which I think can be solved.

One of these roadblocks is the current permission system built in and
around OSSL.

Currently even no threat OSSL functions are not permitted by default
(all OSSL functions are not permitted by default via example INI.)  A
growing number of region administrators see the benefit of some of
some of the OSSL functions, and are going to the extra effort of
enabling them -- but the majority of regions continue to use the
defaults.


As a script creator, who is looking to create highly usable, possibly
profitable scripts, I would want to make sure that my scripts are
usable by the largest number of people in the greatest number of
regions possible.  I would also want to make my scripts use the best
and most efficient methods of accomplishing the script's goal.  For
example, using a single prim, with dynamic texture OSSL functions
rather then a 20 prim object with 21 scripts and dozens of textures
(large xyText displays) or allowing an event administrator access to
set wind for a regatta so that sailboats can simply use llWind()
rather then a wind beacon using llShout() and a separate wind
calculation script in each sailboat.

One problem though, is if I build my object to use the Dynamic Texture
OSSL functions and the person who purchased it wants to use it in a
region that has not enabled those functions, the script fails with an
exception and execution of the current event halts.  This exception is
sent out to the debug window in client viewers, and the script error
icon appears over the object.

As a script creator this would be Very Bad[tm].  Thus I am much more
likely to just use the old established method of using xyText displays
because they're more reliable.

However if had some way  to determine if the Dynamic Texture OSSL
functions were available, without causing script errors -- I could
gracefully fail (with a message to the user about needing the OSSL
function enabled), I can fall back on doing it the old established
way, or I can simply disable the functionality that required that OSSL
function.

Currently there are some ugly ways I can determine if a function is
available.  One of which is via the use of a timer, and a set of flag
variables, I can set a flag that I'm *attempting* to call the
function, if it succeeds I mark a flag indicating that it's available
-- if it fails, then the flag isn't updated and the next time the
timer event fires, I will know that the previous attempt failed, and I
flag that the OSSL function isn't available.  This is an ugly kludge,
and results in a script error icon appears as well as the exception
being thrown to debug output.

To this end I propose adding a few OSSL functions that would be
available to script creators:

bool osIsOSSLEnabled() -- this method always works regardless of all
other OSSL settings and permissions, and returns true/false
bool osIsPermissible(string function) -- this method checks to see if
the current script is allowed to execute the given function.  This
function would fail if OSSL is disabled.

I have a mantis ticket currently open that has a possible
implementation that utilizes C# attributes, so that functions can be
tagged with threat levels at compile time.  Those threat levels can
then be easily checked via reflection at run time to determine their
threat level, thus enabling the creation of an &quot;Is Permissible&quot; type
function.  It has been pointed out that sometimes reflection should be
avoided.  The reflection look-up could be cached to reduce repetitive
reflection look-ups, or a pro-active permissions dictionary could be
established during region initialization instead.

I'd appreciate people's comments/suggestions/feedback regarding the
general idea, as well as feedback on the specific implementation.

Thanks,
Michael Cortez
