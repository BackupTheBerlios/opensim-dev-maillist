<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>First of all, congratulations and thanks for the MXP client and its 
connection to OpenSim. I confess that addition to trunk a few weeks back 
got me a bit by surprise, given that it got very little discussion, and 
I haven't looked at it until today. But I finally did it. So here's a 
belated technical assessment -- every substantial addition  to OpenSim 
deserves that!

I think the MXP client is doing many good things for OpenSim, namely: 
(1) it's showing how OpenSim is so much more than Second Life, being a 
simulation server that can accommodate a variety of clients; (2) it's 
showing how easy it is to write 3D rendering clients for OpenSim, and 
how easy it is to extend OpenSim for those clients; (3) it's going to 
force us to think hard about commonalities and differences among  those 
clients, and how we need to refactor the server side to best capture all 
that commonality and diversity.

The MXP client right now seems to be very simple, not a lot of features. 
As I was looking at the code that is currently in MXPClientView, I was 
forced to think about how the heck some of those methods are going to 
work in MXP, and, more important, why they are being called from Scene 
in the first place. Where those methods map well to the MXP client, we 
have important commonalities -- those should be the only ones in 
IClientAPI; where they don't map, we have a 'leak' from the Linden 
client into our OpenSim framework -- those should be in some other place 
pertaining to the Linden client only and used by modules in 
OpenSim.Client.Linden.

For example, Chat maps well. SendWearables and SendAppearance may not 
map well, since we have it tied down to one very specific representation 
of wearables and appearance; other clients may have different 
representations, and I would hope the MXP client does it differently. 
But the concept of  wearables and appearance may also exist in your 
client, so this means that we need to make a lot more things Interfaces, 
rather than concrete classes. Things like SendDetailedEstateData will, 
hopefully, not map at all -- meaning that the EstateManagementModule 
should probably not be included in CoreModules, but placed somewhere in 
OpenSim.Client.Linden.

As for the other parts that you mention specifically in your email, 
Identity and Inventory are client-side decisions -- you can decide to do 
them anyway you want, and that's refreshing. It looks like you're not 
going to make the same decisions that Linden Lab did. Good :-) Most of 
what I sent to this list pertaining to those topics really is about how 
to hack around the built-in decisions in the Linden viewer regarding 
Authentication, Inventory, and other security-sensitive features, in 
order to make it safe for use in a decentralized open system. This is 
because OpenSim has been using the LL viewer as a fixed point in the 
design.

This problem of beating the LL viewer into a responsible behavior is 
related to, but differs from, the discussion of what clients *should* do 
in order for the overall system to behave responsibly with the user's 
private data -- first of all, that depends on what kind of system you 
want to produce. If you want to play only in the walled-garden arena, 
you have a set of security constraints on the data; if you want to play 
in the special partners arena, you have slightly more constraints; and 
if you want to play in a completely decentralized and open world, you 
have a much larger set of constraints on that data.

These decisions only affect the server to the extent that you rely on 
the regions to perform security-critical operations, which is the case 
with the current Linden viewer. That doesn't work for open systems. If 
you simply don't do that on your client, you immediately avoid 95% of 
the security holes that the Linden viewer has (they're 'holes' only to 
the extent that we are trying to use the LL Viewer in a decentralized 
open system such as the Hypergrid).

</I>&gt;<i> OpenSimulator UGAIM architecture discussion. This text is based on the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion on this list and on formulation of an overall picture using
</I>&gt;<i> MXP terminology. I would like to hear your comments. Have I understood
</I>&gt;<i> things correctly and written it in understandable form? Is there
</I>&gt;<i> problems or mistakes on how I wrote the things down?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When we had the previous MXP version ready our conclusion was that we
</I>&gt;<i> needed some serious contribution from OpenSimulator to help fill in
</I>&gt;<i> the blank spots. I am happy to say that both technical details and
</I>&gt;<i> missing architecture areas have come to focus as a result of working
</I>&gt;<i> with OpenSimulator and reading this list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Identity Management
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Identity management, authenticaton and authorization are well
</I>&gt;<i> established areas. Identities are managed by open identity providers.
</I>&gt;<i> Participant identity consists of identity provider URI and participant
</I>&gt;<i> UUID. Participant may authenticate to identity provider by any means
</I>&gt;<i> available. Identity provider hands out one time tokens to participant.
</I>&gt;<i> These tokens are then used to to authenticate to bubbles and other
</I>&gt;<i> services. Bubbles and other services verify the tokens by invoking
</I>&gt;<i> verification requests to the identity provider. See OpenId and OAuth
</I>&gt;<i> for detailed description.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Inventory Management
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Inventories are analogous to remote file systems with metadata
</I>&gt;<i> support. User has own directory where data can be stored. The
</I>&gt;<i> inventory service is not bound to identity provider or home bubble but
</I>&gt;<i> can be freely acquired from any compliant provider. Each user and user
</I>&gt;<i> group can have zero to many inventories. If no inventory is available
</I>&gt;<i> for user it is not possible to store data to inventory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Asset Management
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Asset management, storage and delivery are challenging from
</I>&gt;<i> ideological, theoretical and engineering view points. MXP is not an
</I>&gt;<i> asset delivery protocol. In ideological level it is enough to state
</I>&gt;<i> that any asset can easily be extracted with a specialized client.
</I>&gt;<i> Because of this there is no feasible technological way to absolutely
</I>&gt;<i> protect assets in an open system. MXP currently relies on the same
</I>&gt;<i> model as world wide web does. If a better model is introduced it will
</I>&gt;<i> be adopted. In practice this means that assets are delivered to all
</I>&gt;<i> connected participants by the asset cache of a bubble over HTTP.
</I>&gt;<i> Original assets are stored in an inventory of user or organization.
</I>&gt;<i> When user creates an object he assigns his own inventory or an
</I>&gt;<i> organization inventory to the object. The assigned inventory contains
</I>&gt;<i> assets of the object. This inventory is then used by bubble to load
</I>&gt;<i> the assets to local cache for further delivery to clients. In this
</I>&gt;<i> scheme the asset distribution is load balanced through bubbles and
</I>&gt;<i> inventory owners can control spread of their objects by limiting the
</I>&gt;<i> bubbles which may access the inventory in question. Asset ids are all
</I>&gt;<i> always assigned by inventories according to the proper UUID generation
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm which will effectively remove threat of id collisions
</I>&gt;<i> between assets from different inventories. See OpenSimulator
</I>&gt;<i> AssetServer Proposal for detailed description of protocol proposal.
