<PRE>+1, strongly agree.  How content is handled is largely IMO an issue of
the TOS extended by the grid owner.  OpenSIM should provide a robust
permissions system to allow content creators to manage access to
resources inside a grid but how something leaves or moves across a grid
is tied to the TOS for that grid.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Who are you giving permissions to the Avatar or the owner of the Avatar?
</I>&gt;<i> This is the rudimentary issue at the bottom of this, and is IMHO the 
</I>&gt;<i> cause of most of the confusion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can't make a legal agreement with an Avatar -- in all likelyhood, 
</I>&gt;<i> the only legal standings an avatar is going to have in court is as an 
</I>&gt;<i> alias for an actual human.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore you are always making an agreement with the owner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now you may be making an agreement that the owner is being licensed to 
</I>&gt;<i> use an object within the confines of a specific grid, t the owner is 
</I>&gt;<i> permitted to make digital copies of said object within the regions of 
</I>&gt;<i> that grid, is restricted to using those copies with a single specific 
</I>&gt;<i> avatar and is not allowed to provide those copies to other people.  This 
</I>&gt;<i> is what some creators and users believe is happening when you mark 
</I>&gt;<i> something as No Transfer, Copy, No Mod.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now others believe, for the same permissions that you are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Selling the owner a digital copy of the item.  Since they now own it, 
</I>&gt;<i> they are legally entitled to fair rights usage including backing it up.  
</I>&gt;<i> They believe they have agreed to some terms of usage during the 
</I>&gt;<i> purchase, which includes the fact that they will not modify the item or 
</I>&gt;<i> provide it to others.  However since they (the human) own it, they feel 
</I>&gt;<i> they can use said item anywhere, any grid, or any purpose including 
</I>&gt;<i> importing it into their own 3D applications and creating 3D meshes that 
</I>&gt;<i> they may render to jpeg and use to decorate their personal website.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And then there are lots of shades of gray between those two points.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The permissions based system regardless of security issues does 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; address this however imperfectly.
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO the permissions system, as envisioned by LL fails utterly to convey 
</I>&gt;<i> in a manor that is clear and concise as to what you are actually buying 
</I>&gt;<i> or licensing when you spend L$ within SL, to &quot;purchase&quot; an object.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For more fun, one can always try to decode the LL Terms of Service:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Section 1.3: 
</I>&gt;<i> ... &quot;You acknowledge that Linden Lab and other Content Providers have 
</I>&gt;<i> rights in their respective Content under copyright and other applicable 
</I>&gt;<i> laws and treaty provisions, and that except as described in this 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreement, such rights are not licensed or otherwise transferred by mere 
</I>&gt;<i> use of the Service.&quot; ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Section 3.2
</I>&gt;<i> ...&quot;Notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand and agree that by 
</I>&gt;<i> submitting your Content to any area of the service, you automatically 
</I>&gt;<i> grant (and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant) 
</I>&gt;<i> to Linden Lab:&quot;...  (a) a royalty-free, worldwide, fully paid-up, 
</I>&gt;<i> perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to (i) use, 
</I>&gt;<i> reproduce and distribute your Content within the Service as permitted by 
</I>&gt;<i> you through your interactions on the Service
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Many of these sections have been misread and misquoted, I myself have 
</I>&gt;<i> done so. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However at this point, I am fairly certain the intent of the only 
</I>&gt;<i> license users of Second Life are agreeing to by merely using the system, 
</I>&gt;<i> and buying/selling content in a normal fashion (no included license 
</I>&gt;<i> notecards and such) -- is the right to use LL's SL.  You never have any 
</I>&gt;<i> legal rights at all to the items you &quot;buy&quot; in the system.  A license is 
</I>&gt;<i> never established between the content creators and the buyers -- instead 
</I>&gt;<i> the license creators have licensed the content to Linden Labs, and under 
</I>&gt;<i> the Terms of Service, Linden Labs allows other users to utilize the 
</I>&gt;<i> content within the system.  I'm not even sure you can argue quid pro quo 
</I>&gt;<i> has granted you a license or ownership, because LL makes it quite clear 
</I>&gt;<i> that &quot;Linden Dollars&quot; have no intrinsic value, and all you have is a 
</I>&gt;<i> license to move around some bits on their database servers that are 
</I>&gt;<i> labeled as &quot;Linden Dollars&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I highly doubt this is the intent of the vast mast majority of OpenSim 
</I>&gt;<i> developers and potential users for this to be the case on any grid they 
</I>&gt;<i> provide or visit.
