I think this would make only a good first step.

It leaves things entirely in too much limbo if said URI goes down, 
especially if the creator had no desire to use an &quot;open source&quot; license, 
or any license provided by a 3rd party and choose to instead use a 
license of their making.  The user may not even have a web site.

One intriguing way of doing it via a Region Module, would basically be 
to have an in-world &quot;/license&quot; command -- which is used to both view and 
attach a license.  You create your license using a notecard and do 
/license &lt;item&gt; &lt;notecard&gt; to &quot;attach&quot; the license.  Then you use 
/license &lt;item&gt; to retrieve the license.  Of course you would allow 
expose capabilities to allow viewers to access these licenses directly 
and retrieve them with dialogs or other mechanisms that are a bit 
cleaner then a chat interface.

I'd like to see things go a step farther, and actually have the author 
specify along with their license a bit of xml or other configuration, 
that specifies what/how they want their license expressed as permissions 
within the system.  This makes things much more complicated, but would 
allow future things such as &quot;Allow export&quot; which could specifically flag 
and enable users to easily save their content via their viewer for use 
elsewhere.

Heck, there's even the legal mess that a creator may choose specifically 
to limit an item to a single grid.  Which creates all kinds of 
interesting issues with hypergrid scenarios, for example the grid owner 
may be violating the rights of the creator by providing a script binary 
to a client (see various bittorrent, file sharing cases) - so that the 
client can upload it to another grid.

Fun food for thought,
