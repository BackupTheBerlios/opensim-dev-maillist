<PRE>I think OpenSim.Framework should be for things that run on the server
side inside the UGAIM servers, and OpenSimLib should be for things
that interoperate with it from outside the UGAIM servers.

For example, envision UGAIM running as services under Windows 2008,
running in their own user contexts... versus a GUI client to control
and configure them, run from the Administrator's account context.
OpenSimLib.Admin would be a good namespace for this particular
context.

OpenSimLib.Communications would be a good namespace for alternative
communications mechanisms to allow (for example) &gt;4096-distant
teleports.

OpenSimLib.Meshes would be a good namespace for classes related to the
construction of meshes in a manner that's consistent with OpenSim's
requirements.

OpenSimLib.Structure would be a good place to put redefinitions of
OpenSim's internal structures, along with their serialization
mechanisms (for example, mesh class definition with serializers and
deserializers to export and import externally-editable files).

Just tossing out an idea.  The biggest headache will be the &quot;interface
versions&quot; issue.

(Would it make more sense to describe these things in IDL and generate
C# from that?)

</I>&gt;<i> which could be used by both OpenSim and viewer projects wishing to implement
</I>&gt;<i> prims and sculpties. In order to make this a standalone dll I had to create
</I>&gt;<i> internal types for quaternions and vectors, and the associated methods and
</I>&gt;<i> operators. In this case it is a small duplication of code in other modules
</I>&gt;<i> in OpenSim, but it's probably ok as I needed to extend those types while
</I>&gt;<i> coding Primmesher anyway. The code on forge and in OpenSim are identical and
</I>&gt;<i> one could easily delete those 2 files from OpenSim and just use the dll file
</I>&gt;<i> from forge. This was my intent but I ran into some difficulties with
</I>&gt;<i> prebuild.xml and the location of the dll file in the physics folder in the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim tree, as it would not build successfully on some systems. So for now
</I>&gt;<i> I am maintaining both source trees and keeping the code in sync.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I need more architectural advice.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm working on a client that has all the control over the agents. For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that, it uses the sending part of the RESTInterregionComms module that I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> did a couple of months ago -- a module which now is clearly out of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> place. That module is not about interregion comms; it's about comms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involving regions, but not necessarily *between* regions. In my case,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's between the client and the region. I'm &quot;using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim.Region.CoreModules.Communications.REST&quot; in my client -- horrible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, I want to break it down into 2 parts, sending and receiving. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> question is: where should I place these two parts? The receiving part
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can continue to be a region module in CoreModules -- that's perfectly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fine. But how about the sending part?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The sending part needs to be in a dll that can be used by other programs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out there, just like my client. This is, in fact, what will make OpenSim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interoperable from the &#160;outside -- its use API, as opposed to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wonderful extension API provided by region modules. Should these things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be in OpenSim.Framework.*? I was tempted to think so, but then I looked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at what's in there, and it's clearly facing the internals. Should it be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in OpenSim.Region.Communications.*?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim.Region.CoreModules.Communications.REST with sending and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receiving parts as separate modules? (but then the importers of this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will get all the other CoreModules as a dll, which doesn't feel right)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Your thoughts appreciated. Just think of what makes sense from a program
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that wants to use OpenSim libraries.
