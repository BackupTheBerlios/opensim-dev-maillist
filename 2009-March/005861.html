<PRE>Running Mono I take it?

The mono garbage collector sucks. Nebadon can give you some tips on optimizing it a bit.

I forgot to mention that this instance is likely to crash and/or making the computer not working well for other instances (real memory is 2 GB only). Does it means that we cannot have more than 1000 prims on a sim? :)

In Cyberlandia we have a sim &quot;prometeo&quot; where some builders are doing some interesting building developments. Now there is a real interesting architecture made with a certain amount of superprims and some wonderful buildings made by some very interestingly crafted rounded prims. In total they are around 2200 prims (not so much I have been told). And there are around 60 scripts which are not doing anything particular.

What it happens is that the supporting instance (1 instance holding this sim) will go instantly to 400 Mbytes, and after some hours it goes to 1.7 GB or REAL memory.
I don't have any tools to understand what is happening, but this makes this island almost impossible to use :(

If any core programmers wanted to have a look on this and help us understand if there is something forbidden in the prims, or probably some bugs in SL, that would be very nice.

If you want to download this oar <A HREF="http://opensimita.org/upload/prometeo-mantis.oar.gz.">http://opensimita.org/upload/prometeo-mantis.oar.gz.</A> (~32 Megabytes of oar).

Tell me if should I open a mantis on this.

Thanks,
salahzar
