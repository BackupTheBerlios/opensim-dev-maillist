<PRE>Agreed that there should be a way to attach a license to an asset. Prim
assets can have a notecard included which might be useful as a way to convey
license, but other assets such as textures, animations, and even closed
source scripts are unable to have any additional attributes associated with
them using this method.
I'm not sure I would support having Creative Commons be the default
though... while it is an excellent option for some work and I have used it
for some content I have developed, it does reduce the creator's rights that
are normally assumed by the Berne convention or US copyright laws. I think
it would be nice to have a few boilerplate licenses such as Creative Commons
of GPL or BSD or whatever available, but only as an addition to the ability
to add free-form license text.

Then again, I really think we need some kind of asset metadata storage
capability, and license could be one metadata attribute.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This in my humble opinion is a good reason why I believe the asset

</I>&gt;<i> blob attached to it that includes actual licensing terms -- perhaps with
</I>&gt;<i> the default check box permissions being assigned to various creative

</I>&gt;<i> check boxes mean for themselves and when they encounter an item where
</I>&gt;<i> they're different, they're informed via blue message box (for legacy
</I>&gt;<i> integration) -- but even better would be to talk to the Hippo and other
</I>&gt;<i> alternative viewer creators, to see if something can be integrated to
</I>&gt;<i> display the creators licensing terms directly.

</I>&gt;<i> Just a few random thoughts,
