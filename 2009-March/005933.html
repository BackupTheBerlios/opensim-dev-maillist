<PRE>The MSSQL database schema limits region names to 20 characters, so
having discovered the hard way that names longer than that cause trouble
when registering with a grid we've now avoided that problem with
validation on the web app we use that serves the region xml. I have no
idea when 20 characters was set for the limit, and had assumed this was
just one of those numbers dictated by the client and didn't think we
were different from the MySQL configuration until this email. 

 

That aside, if there are client issues over 32 characters then regions
shouldn't be allowed to register with the grid if the client used to
connect to those regions is the LL client. Perhaps there could be a
regex setting in the ini for validating region names? Would leave room
for different validation requirements for different clients.

 I am getting some comments about region names beginning with spaces
*and*
 region names longer then 32 characters having some side effects in map
and
 search from OSGrid users.

 It makes me wonder if the grid server should have some additional
 constraints to trim leading spaces and names longer then 32 characters
so
 associated .PHP programs and the client do not get unhappy.

 So, I pose the question and wonder what folks think is the proper
solution.
