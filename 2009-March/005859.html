<PRE>Hi,

One problem I've been increasingly having recently is keeping
track of what oar file has been deployed on a specific region. When users
report bugs it would be very handy to know exactly what oar file they
are using. Often the bug reporter is a different person from the person
who administers the machine and doesn't have access to the console.

It would be pretty simple to create a an inworld object that has a version
number embedded in the script that can be reported to users, but I'm pretty
sure I'd often forget to change the version number before creating the oar file.

So I was wondering what people would think of a UTC date/timestamp being automatically 
added to the oar files (perhaps along with the machine name) that could be loaded
by the region when the oar file was loaded. This could then be accessed via
an os* script call. Ideally this property would also be retained across server
restarts. Is there a better way of doing what I want?

Regards,

Chris
