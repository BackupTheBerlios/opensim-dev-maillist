<PRE>Finally Linden Lab produced an interesting document:
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lentczner-ogp-base-00.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lentczner-ogp-base-00.txt</A>

I think capabilities are the right concept here, and I'm pleased to see 
them taking center stage in that document. In particular the hint at 
inventory-related capabilities, which will allow secure inventory access.

I'm not sure I buy into some of the details, but the basic combination 
HTTP+REST+Capabilities --&gt; +1.

The Event Queue...well...  It sucks. I think we need to look at 
alternatives for posting things to the client. I can't believe there 
aren't any; I think there are, but maybe they all come down to this, 
event queues on the server-side, whatever their form.

If there are no better alternatives, then we need at least to rethink 
what the EQ is all about. If the EQ CAP is not given to the regions, but 
stays within the user's home system, that might work. Also, if there 
would be several different *types* of Event Queues that might work well 
too; so for example, we might give the social-net-related EQ CAP 
(groups, IM, etc) to the social net component without compromising agent 
transfers. The more I think about this, the more I'm convinced that 
regions have no business in agent transfer activities, other than 
negotiating the capabilities when agents come.

I really like that document, I must say, but it's strength is also its 
weakness. It's just about the basic levels. It says nothing about how 
those things are driven higher up.
