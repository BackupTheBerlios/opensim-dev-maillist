<PRE>Heho,


To come tot he header question:  no, this is by far not to much.

Have a look at 

<A HREF="http://opensim.cybertechnews.org/?p=71">http://opensim.cybertechnews.org/?p=71</A>


and maybe use the sizing guide:
OpenSim : Count around 20-30Mb for this (it seems to have increased a bit
since the update)
Empty Region : ~10-15Mb for all the listener etc.
Prims : ~20prims per Mb.
Scripts: ~6 scripts per Mb

These are absolute minimums.

If you look at the ctn-link above, you will understand that restart does not
mean (at least not always), that there is a memory leak. Opensim does cache
stuff... and that can summarize nicely..


Furthermore, think about avatar load:


1 avatar 
MrA's client must recieve the appearance data for MrA. 
Data transmission count : 1

2 avatars (Mr A, Mrs B)
MrA's client must recieve the appearance data for MrA &amp; MrsB
MrsB's client must recieve the appearance data for MrsB &amp; MrA
Data transmission count : 4

3 avatars (MrA, MrsB, MrC)
MrA's client must recieve the appearance data for MrA, MrsB &amp; MrC
MrsB's client must recieve the appearance data for MrsB, MrA &amp; MrC
MrC's client must recieve the appearance data for MrC, MrA &amp; MrsB
Data transmission count : 9

4 avatars (MrA, MrsB, MrC, MrsD)
MrA's client must recieve the appearance data for MrA, MrsB, MrC &amp; MrsD
MrsB's client must recieve the appearance data for MrsB, MrA, MrC &amp; MrsD
MrC's client must recieve the appearance data for MrC, MrA, MrsB &amp; MrsD
MrsD's client must recieve the appearance data for MrsD, MrA, MrsB &amp; MrC
Data transmission count : 16


For reliability/speed RAM and network(latencency more than bandwith) does
count.


The memory statistics in opensime are maybe right from a dev view on
objects, but for operations missleading.   You need to use more operating
system based monitoring.


Summary:
I guess, you are low on resources.  I guess the 2GB are permantly assigned
and not some burst (you will seldom even get) - but even 2GB are very low
for that configuration.


Cheers,
Ralf

Hello OSWorld. Just a question about current limits in OS. We are running 4
instances of OpenSIm rev 8810, holding 11 sims on ovh rps-2 (2GB RAM)
connected to an external grid. Top clearly indicates that free memory is
still available

Tasks: 109 total, 1 running, 108 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie
Cpu(s): 24.2%us, 3.3%sy, 0.0%ni, 71.9%id, 0.6%wa, 0.0%hi, 0.0%si, 0.0%st
Mem: 1938152k total, 1868956k used, 69196k free, 39460k buffers
Swap: 976888k total, 27260k used, 949628k free, 125492k cached.

There are just 4 sims with a certain amount of Prims (around 2000-3000 prims
at max and each with some 100-200 simple scripts rotating textures and doing
simple jobs like llSetText etc), and the other sims with at max 200-300
prims. Question is do you think that there is a top limit for prim number
and scripts (even if they are just doing bare things) to have optimal
performance? Also two very similar sims have 2200 prim and 1900 prim but
they show in show stats holding 300 Mbytes and 80 Mbytes, so the first seems
unstable... Is there any profiling mechanism to understand if the system is
working correctly or is undersized or excessively abused?

BTW: the region which is using 300 Mbytes has a certain amount of
superprims. Do superprims have negative impact on the server sim
performance?

Thanks for any hint. Or if you know some URL on opensimulator already
discussing this issue..

Salahzar

PS: Also I noticed I have to restart all the regions almost once a day
otherwise the console becomes unresponsive and the regions appear not
working :(
