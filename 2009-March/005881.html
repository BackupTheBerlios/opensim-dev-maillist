To be honest, I think this is going to be the best way.  Or possibly the version number could be inserted into 'about 
land' once OAR files support parcel information (which they don't yet).  If you do want to automatically insert details 
into these fields then maybe another module could do this automatically when a save oar event is received, though this 
would require some reworking of the code and a module specific mechanism in the absence of a generic one.

</I>&gt;<i> restarts. Is there a better way of doing what I want?
</I>
I have no problem with an embedded timestamp in the archive control xml, but I'm not so sure about machine name - this 
is identifying information that I wouldn't be keen about casually releasing.

The obvious place to persist this data would be in RegionInfo and the regions table.  But I'm not sure what this field 
would be called or whether it could be one that wasn't tightly tied to archive information (since the vast majority of 
regions don't come from archives).
