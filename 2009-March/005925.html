</I>Personally I agree with the statement &quot;if it's disabled, the framework 
should not allow OSSL functions to execute&quot; -- I do however disagree 
with it failing with an exception, error messages to debug output, and 
script error icons while at the same time not providing any way for a 
script creator to pro-actively prevent that error in the first place.

The &quot;Disabled&quot; threat level is an interesting idea.

</I>I don't think anyone is suggesting that we enable all osFunctions by 
default, and certainly not osConsole.  I am not even necessarily 
suggesting that we enable any functions by default, other then the ones 
that allow a script creator to query and determine if they are allowed 
to execute a particular function prior to calling it and having it 
possibly fail with an exception being thrown.


Frisby, Adam wrote:
&gt;<i> A simple bool probably isn't enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's enable an ENUM with the current ThreatLevel, plus maybe a second function which returns a bool , &quot;bool isFunctionAvailible(&quot;osWhatever&quot;);&quot;, the latter ties in with extensible OSSL via Commanders (not enabled now, but in the future it could be).
</I>The original proof of concept patch, provided functions for all of the 
following:
* Is OSSL Enabled?
* What threat level is enabled?
* What's the threat level of a particular function?
* Am I currently allowed to execute a particular function?

The proof of concept placed no security on these functions, so that they 
would always be available.  I can see Melanie's point of view, that an 
administrator of a region should have a way to completely and totally 
disable the OSSL function library -- and when it's disabled it should 
not allow compilation, or execution of any script containing OSSL.  I 
have some ideas that could enforce both of those, but they would require 
more extensive modification of OSSL, and should accompany extension of 
OSSL to support functions provided by region modules.

I believe that the default, should be something that fosters the use of 
OSSL functions that pose little to no security or resource threats, and 
allow creators to use OpenSim to it's full potential.  I'll rework my 
proposal over the next few days, to attempt to address some of the 
concerns that have been raised.

Are there any particular comments regarding implementation?

To allow an isFunctionAvailible() or isFunctionPermissible() or similar, 
requires being able to determine a function's threat level and 
permissions prior to actually calling it, thus requiring some form of 
registration ahead of time.  We already register permissions for 
specific functions when we add them directly to the OpenSim.ini file.  
We could add all functions along with their threat levels to the ini 
file, which would allow region administrators to redefine those threat 
levels themselves. 

My original proposal added C# method attributes, so that methods could 
be tagged at compile time with their threat level and then that threat 
level could be looked up via reflection at run time.  There is some 
expense involved in using reflection, but this can be mitigated by 
caching the result of the lookup in a Dictionary&lt;&gt;.

A third method would be to require all methods to be registered in much 
the same way console commands are registered.

Thoughts?  Suggestions?
