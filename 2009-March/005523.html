<PRE>Heho,

To me - (spead riding this old docs, which I found quite interesting for
historical reasons)  it seems, that the concept is resulting in claim based
and role based (information right) systems in nower days.

However - ACLS are becoming legacy in the next years, even modern standards
for auditing firms (at least Cobit and the 2008 european rules) are
requesting governance over systems and informations. So, not using ACLs for
access on information, this concept true for the future.  ACLs make the
administrator the good, even if he should not have any access - like covered
in the pdf.

Information ownership must be only delegated based on roles (what am I able
to do with it) and claims (wich information from the whole dataset). It must
be revocable, as outlined in the pdf. 


Cheers,
Ralf

Just to keep the record straight, the Capabilities concept is about 50 
years old. It was devised at about the same time as ACLs. For a number 
of reasons, ACLs have dominated the field. See here for a nice 
historical perspective:
