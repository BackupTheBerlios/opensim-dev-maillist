<PRE>I strongly recommend reading that paper I sent the reference to.

The cool thing about CAPs on the web (and the reason why I'm excited 
about it, after knowing _of_ CAPs for 20 years and never really getting 
them) is that CAPs are URLs that can come and go dynamically. Most of 
the CAPs literature is within the field of operating systems, which is 
slightly different. Think of CAPs here as URLs that are dynamically 
created and revoked. If the URL is not there, you can't access the 
service even if you know about the URL.

So yes, region A can get a one-time CAP for an item, and instead of 
using it, it passes it to region B. You have the same problem with 
Tokens: region A gets the authorized token, but instead of using it, 
passes it to region B. This is, as you say, a matter of certifying the 
receiver, which is a separate matter.

It would be nice to have some security experts in this discussion...
On my end I'm really excited with this idea of URLs that come and go in 
shared-secret URLs instead of fixed URLs+authentication+authorization.
