<PRE>I never said the database had an issue &#8211; just saying that my database (MSSQL) has an issue (legacy code most likely) and that I probably need to look a little more closely as to why, thinking out loud on mailing lists considered harmful &#8211; apologies!

 

The last bit of my email is my 2p. If there&#8217;s a problem on certain clients, perhaps a regex in the ini to validate names before they can be brought online -  but I&#8217;m sure there are likely better ideas out there.

Well, I dont *know* if the MySQL has this issue or not, yet. I went ahead and reported what I had heard.

*If* we have this issue, then it is one of Regions/region.xml files registering a region with a long name and/or a name with spaces in the front. 

It seemed appropriate to discuss it as it is one theory why some searches are causing clients to crash.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] funky region names?

The MSSQL database schema limits region names to 20 characters, so having discovered the hard way that names longer than that cause trouble when registering with a grid we&#8217;ve now avoided that problem with validation on the web app we use that serves the region xml. I have no idea when 20 characters was set for the limit, and had assumed this was just one of those numbers dictated by the client and didn&#8217;t think we were different from the MySQL configuration until this email. 

 

That aside, if there are client issues over 32 characters then regions shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to register with the grid if the client used to connect to those regions is the LL client. Perhaps there could be a regex setting in the ini for validating region names? Would leave room for different validation requirements for different clients.

 I am getting some comments about region names beginning with spaces *and*
 region names longer then 32 characters having some side effects in map and
 search from OSGrid users.

 It makes me wonder if the grid server should have some additional
 constraints to trim leading spaces and names longer then 32 characters so
 associated .PHP programs and the client do not get unhappy.

 So, I pose the question and wonder what folks think is the proper solution.
