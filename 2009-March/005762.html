<PRE>It is a bit sad that this effort goes to waste. The opensim.ini is too
big to be efficient and everyone is wasting a lot of time browsing it
back and forth. I think something like splitting it up or moving
defaults to other file is really needed.

What is complex now is finding the properties you need from the
opensim property file. I think justincc:s proposal was elegant and
people should look deeper into it. It would definetly make everyones
life easier.

Honestly I also think that it is counter productive to give + or -
based on someone elses opinion (your favorite architect or the sorts).
One should only vote if one has himself looked into the matter. We are
not building political machine to steer opensim architecture are we?
Rather a board of specialists who look into the subject and give their
opinion if they are interested enough to dig into it. Otherwise we can
end up with a system where someone off handedly gives a - and as chain
reaction we get huge opposition for perfectly good suggestion or the
other way around.
