<PRE>Hello OSWorld. Just a question about current limits in OS. We are running 4
instances of OpenSIm rev 8810, holding 11 sims on ovh rps-2 (2GB RAM)
connected to an external grid. Top clearly indicates that free memory is
still available

Tasks: 109 total, 1 running, 108 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie
Cpu(s): 24.2%us, 3.3%sy, 0.0%ni, 71.9%id, 0.6%wa, 0.0%hi, 0.0%si, 0.0%st
Mem: 1938152k total, 1868956k used, 69196k free, 39460k buffers
Swap: 976888k total, 27260k used, 949628k free, 125492k cached.

There are just 4 sims with a certain amount of Prims (around 2000-3000 prims
at max and each with some 100-200 simple scripts rotating textures and doing
simple jobs like llSetText etc), and the other sims with at max 200-300
prims. Question is do you think that there is a top limit for prim number
and scripts (even if they are just doing bare things) to have optimal
performance? Also two very similar sims have 2200 prim and 1900 prim but
they show in show stats holding 300 Mbytes and 80 Mbytes, so the first seems
unstable... Is there any profiling mechanism to understand if the system is
working correctly or is undersized or excessively abused?

BTW: the region which is using 300 Mbytes has a certain amount of
superprims. Do superprims have negative impact on the server sim
performance?

Thanks for any hint. Or if you know some URL on opensimulator already
discussing this issue..

Salahzar

PS: Also I noticed I have to restart all the regions almost once a day
otherwise the console becomes unresponsive and the regions appear not
working :(
