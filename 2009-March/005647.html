Mike, certainly TarArchiveReader and TarArchiveWriter can be moved to OpenSim.Framework.  It might be nice to pop them 
in a separate directory (e.g. OpenSim.Framework.Archive), especially since they probably should be replaced by a third 
party library at some stage.

It would also be great to reuse the iar code rather than cut and paste it between the AssetInventoryServer and the 
region module.  Perhaps this is one place where the work MW was doing to enable modules to be shared between the region 
and other servers might come in handy.  However, it might be necessary to keep a separate piece as a region module since 
it needs to register commands that can be invoked from the console.

Also, it's worth bearing in mind that the iar format isn't really ready for use yet (I need to tweak it further and put 
in some version information).

Possibly the oar code should also move, though this code is more tightly tied to a region, so perhaps it can just stay 
where it is for now.

Essentially, I'm happy with whatever reorg of the code you want to do to get the functionality you want (I don't know if 
a separate assembly would be overkill or not).

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
