<PRE>Dear all,

i while ago i went over the legal side of many aspects with 2 lawyer.

Since this is a multinational question and in many cases has not exampels
(e.g. no judgments by court) it tends to be a discussion based on personal
flavor, but not legal facts.

And yes, maybe there is enough mud for the whole 3D web.

But to come to the point:

- I don&#180;t know any country, where having the ability to add a
hypergrid-aware note about the creator and a license (hint, url, notecard)
would have negative impact

- I know a few countrys where it would realy help from legal side

- it would be a clear sign, that the opensim crew takes care about content
rights and ownership


And yes, this only is another brick in the wall of copyright protection. We
still have RL laws, we still need secure technical system, rights management
etc etc...

And spoken in sex beds, I am more afraid about the pure mass von animations
etc - a few more notecards don&#180;t worry me to much.   :-)

So - if it is possible somehow, please add it.


Just my 2 cent...


Cheers,
Ralf

Won't this also force grids to do what SL do and forbid users to transfer
their accounts/log in details to someone else (and hence all their
inventory)?

Why do I get the feeling that we are starting to wade in mud?

Can't all the issues of permissions, i.e. the three future (next owner)
permissions, and the extra two current permissions (anyone can copy, anyone
can move), and licensing, all be dealt with in the TOS of the individual
grids, which then apply to all users of that grid, both creators and
end-users?

Can you imagine the mess of an object with multiple textures, filled with
various anims, scripts and notecards (thinking sexgen bed here), and they
all have different permissions/licenses. Doesn't bear thinking about :(

Rock
