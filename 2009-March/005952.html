<PRE>Licence sounds good, actually, if we could find a way to integrate that. I&#8217;m happy for folks to take content I have created elsewhere, other opensim grids, etc. A licence next to each item and my name next to it would be nice to have, however it&#8217;s implemented, to make it clear I&#8217;m happy for you to use it, just know that I made it originally. Likewise, the option of copyright, reserved rights, etc. and terms on redistribution would be great to have alongside other content. I would love to have that in opensim, clear as crystal, dispel any confusion. 

 

I tell people &#8220;Full perms!= full rights, sometimes it is, sometimes it isn&#8217;t. If in doubt, ask the creator&#8221;, but that&#8217;s not really ideal.

That seems like a good idea. Another idea would be add a drop down box and choose a type of license, such as Copyright: All rights reserved, or open source, etc...

</I>Depending on your interpretation of Linden Lab's legal documents
including their ToS, one may come to the conclusion that the only person
who is being granted a copyright license (regardless of what permissions
check boxes you click) is Linden Labs, who is being granted a right to
use a creators content as intended by the creator within their system.

Now of course this is just one interpretation, and I'm sure if you get
two different lawyers in the same room looking at those documents you
may get two completely different answers as well.

This in my humble opinion is a good reason why I believe the asset
system should be extended in such a way that every asset can have a text
blob attached to it that includes actual licensing terms -- perhaps with
the default check box permissions being assigned to various creative
commons licensing attributes.  Or allow the user to decide what those
check boxes mean for themselves and when they encounter an item where
they're different, they're informed via blue message box (for legacy
integration) -- but even better would be to talk to the Hippo and other
alternative viewer creators, to see if something can be integrated to
display the creators licensing terms directly.

Just a few random thoughts,
