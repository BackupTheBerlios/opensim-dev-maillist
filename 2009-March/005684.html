<PRE>I had a similar intention with Primmesher. Currently there is a
primmesher.dll project on forge which is a dll containing the 2 files
Primmesher.cs and Sculptmesh.cs. My intent was to have a single dll file
which could be used by both OpenSim and viewer projects wishing to implement
prims and sculpties. In order to make this a standalone dll I had to create
internal types for quaternions and vectors, and the associated methods and
operators. In this case it is a small duplication of code in other modules
in OpenSim, but it's probably ok as I needed to extend those types while
coding Primmesher anyway. The code on forge and in OpenSim are identical and
one could easily delete those 2 files from OpenSim and just use the dll file
from forge. This was my intent but I ran into some difficulties with
prebuild.xml and the location of the dll file in the physics folder in the
OpenSim tree, as it would not build successfully on some systems. So for now
I am maintaining both source trees and keeping the code in sync.

</I>&gt;<i> fine. But how about the sending part?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The sending part needs to be in a dll that can be used by other programs

</I>&gt;<i> interoperable from the  outside -- its use API, as opposed to the
</I>&gt;<i> wonderful extension API provided by region modules. Should these things
</I>&gt;<i> be in OpenSim.Framework.*? I was tempted to think so, but then I looked
</I>&gt;<i> at what's in there, and it's clearly facing the internals. Should it be
</I>&gt;<i> in OpenSim.Region.Communications.*?
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.Region.CoreModules.Communications.REST with sending and
</I>&gt;<i> receiving parts as separate modules? (but then the importers of this
</I>&gt;<i> will get all the other CoreModules as a dll, which doesn't feel right)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your thoughts appreciated. Just think of what makes sense from a program
</I>&gt;<i> that wants to use OpenSim libraries.
