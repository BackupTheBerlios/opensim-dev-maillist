<PRE>Well, 

beiing pished - you are talking about &quot;getting the users token&quot; ?

pishing to me is getting information the owner would not grant you, if you
did not request them by ways he assusmes to be something/someone else
requesting this.

Just the &quot;token&quot; to log me in.. its not password pishing or so..

... ah..  I think I got you..

- someone want to log into  &quot;travel.com&quot;
- we logs on to &quot;trovel.com&quot;
- books a journey
- opens the claim (in 2.x of opened) on his creditcard data

That is the pishing thing you think about ?

I guess its not worse than what happen now, the people would just use their
creditcard on a wrong website.


It&#180;s a little bit related to your other message &quot;how people interact&quot;, but
opened is not guilty here - it adds just one more warning (people ignore).


Cheers,
Ralf

There is nothing wrong with the mechanism and its roots. In fact, when I 
first read the spec I liked it a lot. But I hadn't used this until 2 
hours ago.

There is, potentially, a huge hole in the resulting system because it 
ignores how people interact with their computers. Did anyone make a 
serious study about how the normal people react to being phished on 
using OpenID? That sounds like a great project for one of my colleagues 
here at UCI...
