<PRE>Cool, I'm glad to see there are more cases.
In my case, this piece of comm needs stuff from OpenSim.Framework 
(RegionInfo, AgentCircuitData) and other data structures from other 
places in opensim (Region.Framework.Scenes.AgentData), which is a bit of 
a mess that needs to be cleaned up too.

[RegionInfo, btw, is E.V.I.L -- I've wasted several hours over the past 
several months fighting with the ExternalEndPoint property. I always get 
it wrong. If we are to expose something like that to other fellow 
humans, I'll probably define another, much simpler, data structure.]

</I>&gt;<i> code on forge and in OpenSim are identical and one could easily delete 
</I>&gt;<i> those 2 files from OpenSim and just use the dll file from forge. This 
</I>&gt;<i> was my intent but I ran into some difficulties with prebuild.xml and 
</I>&gt;<i> the location of the dll file in the physics folder in the OpenSim 
</I>&gt;<i> tree, as it would not build successfully on some systems. So for now I 
</I>&gt;<i> am maintaining both source trees and keeping the code in sync.

</I>&gt;<i>     I need more architectural advice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I'm working on a client that has all the control over the agents. For
</I>&gt;<i>     that, it uses the sending part of the RESTInterregionComms module
</I>&gt;<i>     that I
</I>&gt;<i>     did a couple of months ago -- a module which now is clearly out of
</I>&gt;<i>     place. That module is not about interregion comms; it's about comms
</I>&gt;<i>     involving regions, but not necessarily *between* regions. In my case,
</I>&gt;<i>     it's between the client and the region. I'm &quot;using
</I>&gt;<i>     OpenSim.Region.CoreModules.Communications.REST&quot; in my client --
</I>&gt;<i>     horrible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So, I want to break it down into 2 parts, sending and receiving. The
</I>&gt;<i>     question is: where should I place these two parts? The receiving part
</I>&gt;<i>     can continue to be a region module in CoreModules -- that's perfectly
</I>&gt;<i>     fine. But how about the sending part?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The sending part needs to be in a dll that can be used by other
</I>&gt;<i>     programs
</I>&gt;<i>     out there, just like my client. This is, in fact, what will make
</I>&gt;<i>     OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i>     interoperable from the  outside -- its use API, as opposed to the
</I>&gt;<i>     wonderful extension API provided by region modules. Should these
</I>&gt;<i>     things
</I>&gt;<i>     be in OpenSim.Framework.*? I was tempted to think so, but then I
</I>&gt;<i>     looked
</I>&gt;<i>     at what's in there, and it's clearly facing the internals. Should
</I>&gt;<i>     it be
</I>&gt;<i>     in OpenSim.Region.Communications.*?
</I>&gt;<i>     OpenSim.Region.CoreModules.Communications.REST with sending and
</I>&gt;<i>     receiving parts as separate modules? (but then the importers of this
</I>&gt;<i>     will get all the other CoreModules as a dll, which doesn't feel right)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Your thoughts appreciated. Just think of what makes sense from a
</I>&gt;<i>     program
</I>&gt;<i>     that wants to use OpenSim libraries.
