The oar files all go into a version control system and ideally the
version identifier would get inserted at commit time (as happens
commonly with source code files), but given the oar file would need to
be unpacked and a new UUID generated for the edited asset it makes it a
rather non trivial process.

Ok. I don't really need a machine name and in practice a timestamp to
the second resolution would be unique enough.

&gt;<i> The obvious place to persist this data would be in RegionInfo and the regions table.  But I'm not sure what this field 
</I>&gt;<i> would be called or whether it could be one that wasn't tightly tied to archive information (since the vast majority of 
</I>&gt;<i> regions don't come from archives).
</I>
I think I'd work on the basis that the field would just be blank if an
oar file had never been loaded into this region. Thanks for the advice
- I'll have a go at implementing this.

Regards,

Chris
