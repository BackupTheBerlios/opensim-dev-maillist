<PRE>My professional opinion is that a protocol that serves the user needs does
just that. Asset security is a user need and new, experimental protocols
such as MXP which are trying to establish a user base have an opportunity to
make an advancement it the management of assets and such a technological
advancement may encourage it's eventual adoption. Simply brushing off user
needs such as asset security and respect for content developers and
copyright holders is not an advancement, but rather &quot;sticking one's head in
the sand&quot;.

&gt;<i> My professional opinion is that it is a wild goose chase to try to

</I>&gt;<i> becomes widely adopted there will be open clients and anyone can go
</I>&gt;<i> and use them to get someone elses assets. There is just no way to
</I>&gt;<i> protect yourself against it. World wide web recognizes this and works
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can put our heads in the bush but it does not change the reality.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry to be so blunt about it but someone has to say it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We should not put all things in the same security category either.
</I>&gt;<i> Some security things can be handled both in theory and reality and
</I>&gt;<i> some can not be. This is a situation where you have given the user
</I>&gt;<i> assets inside a container which he has all the keys for. I would not
</I>&gt;<i> say that we should lock the container because the user is too lazy to
</I>&gt;<i> unlock it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Security through obscurity is not a good solution either (using j2k).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any asset protection measures can be countered simple action:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A) Download a hacked client and use it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** This applies to water marked and signed content as well. Once
</I>&gt;<i> client can view it, it can also store it and manipulate it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As it is so easy there will be clients which do this. Why would anyone
</I>&gt;<i> choose restricted client if you can have one which works in open
</I>&gt;<i> fashion and provides you access to every asset? This just is a thing
</I>&gt;<i> we can not control. It is outside our sphere of influence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Asset protection measures will just make our lives harder and not of
</I>&gt;<i> those who want to steal assets. These measures will make development
</I>&gt;<i> harder, adoption slower, cause bugs and above all waste our design
</I>&gt;<i> focus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Only solution I can think of is to have some kind of network of
</I>&gt;<i> content registeries which will keep track of authorized content and
</I>&gt;<i> who has right to use it like Kyle suggested. Then majority of clients
</I>&gt;<i> should respect the registeries. There are two problems though. Can we
</I>&gt;<i> make such system work in global scale? Wont someone just branch and
</I>&gt;<i> make open OpenSim and clients?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Go for simple solution if complex ones do not give you real benefit.
