<PRE>Actually the exact sequence is the following:
1\ start the instance (Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Mono 2.2, REAL machine with 2 GB
RAM) it takes around 3-4 minutes to go up and takes about 400 MB of ram used
from the beginning.
2\ 1 builder enters the sim and build (I'm not sure but it is almost certain
they are using other tools like second inventory)
3\ after some hours of relatively light usage (just 1 avatar working there I
see the huge increment in memory).

Yes, if you can give some hints on how to use some GC or memory profilers to
understand which part is guilty or faulty...

Thanks for the interest. :)
