Yes, I do agree with that.  There's no real reason to only do [de]archiving 
within a running region simulator, though you will lose the runtime checks that 
way.  And I'm sure being able to invoke the functionality without requiring a 
running simulator would be very useful.

So I really don't have a strong objection to putting code into a separate DLL, 
though resolving the interface links may be difficult without effectively 
recreating the module mechanism or doing something messy with ini configuration. 
  The only thing I would want to see (of course) is that the existing 
functionality doesn't become more difficult to use, that any new functionality 
is documented and that the existing oar/iar unit tests continue to be present 
and passing for every panda build.
