<PRE>Hi Andy,

The presenter has worked quite well for me, but there can be quite a  
delay until items are sorted. I put this down to the speed of my  
internet connection though. I also had a problem where the image was  
not supported by SL which seemed to block the whole show. This was a  
while ago though.

Have you looked on the SLOODLE site? <A HREF="http://www.sloodle.org/moodle/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=2468">http://www.sloodle.org/moodle/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=2468</A> 
  Here was one comment regarding the presenter problem here. It may  
not be an OpenSim issue at all? You are more likely to have you post  
read by a SLOODLE developer there.

Regards
Tom
