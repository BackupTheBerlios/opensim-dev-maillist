<PRE>Since we're defaulting to async - we should probably only make a list of what is known to run fast and what isn't.

Just as a quick example - all the terrain packets require some heavyish number crunching and should all be async.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Opensim-dev] Synchronous or Asynchronous.. Packet handler
</I>&gt;<i> synchronicity
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hello Again
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I just wanted to update the people subscribed to opensim-dev about the
</I>&gt;<i> current situation with regards to packet handler synchronicity and
</I>&gt;<i> thread context.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The History:
</I>&gt;<i> Shortly after OpenSimulator started, it was decided that each user
</I>&gt;<i> should have it's own packet processing thread.  This worked well at
</I>&gt;<i> the time, but limited concurrency because of lock and thread
</I>&gt;<i> contention.   5 UDP connections = 5 dedicated threads that spent most
</I>&gt;<i> of their time waiting(this got expensive when child agents were
</I>&gt;<i> considered).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Recently:
</I>&gt;<i> A few months ago, Intel provided some test results and provided a few
</I>&gt;<i> developers to re-write the UDP server and client handling stack.
</I>&gt;<i> One of the things that they did was make each UDP server use two
</I>&gt;<i> threads.  One for the incoming packet processing and one for the
</I>&gt;<i> outgoing packet processing, regardless of how many clients were
</I>&gt;<i> connected to OpenSimulator.    Essentially, this made it 'one thread
</I>&gt;<i> per network connection resource'.   This was great because it reduced
</I>&gt;<i> the amount of threads that opensimulator uses quite significantly.
</I>&gt;<i> There were some problems though.  Some code handling the upper level
</I>&gt;<i> processing (Scene, SceneObjectGroup, SceneObjectPart..  etc.. )  of
</I>&gt;<i> the data in the packet took long enough to process..   to cause the
</I>&gt;<i> simulator to slowly come to a crawl over time and disconnect users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because the infrastructure wasn't in place to selectively delegate
</I>&gt;<i> which packets are handled asynchronously and synchronously, the choice
</I>&gt;<i> was made to process each packet on the threadpool so that a long
</I>&gt;<i> running packet processor wouldn't cause the UDP server to get
</I>&gt;<i> backlogged and cause all users connected to get disconnected.   This
</I>&gt;<i> solution wasn't really optimal..    because a single client, moving
</I>&gt;<i> around, causes ~15 AgentUpdate packets to be sent to the server per
</I>&gt;<i> second.      15 packets means that up to 15 threadpool requests were
</I>&gt;<i> happening a second per connected root agent.       There are various
</I>&gt;<i> reasons why this isn't optimal, I won't go into them here :).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now:
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy to announce, that the infrastructure for selectively
</I>&gt;<i> delegating whether a packet will be processed synchronously or
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronously is in place as of
</I>&gt;<i> 4ef8dc7d96fa2d4efd992ff7d304b8894f004c4f.   You can find the way to
</I>&gt;<i> set a packet handler as synchronous in
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.Region.ClientStack.LindenUDP.LLClientView.RegisterLocalPacketHa
</I>&gt;<i> ndler.
</I>&gt;<i>       Note that packet handlers with 3 parameters with the third one
</I>&gt;<i> set to 'false' means that the packet handler is synchronous.    Packet
</I>&gt;<i> handlers in that method with 2 parameters or 3 parameters and the
</I>&gt;<i> third one set to 'true' means that the packet is processed
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronously on the threadpool using the method defined by
</I>&gt;<i> async_call_method in OpenSim.ini
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've also taken the liberty of setting the AgentUpdate Packet, the
</I>&gt;<i> ViewerEffect Packet, and a few others as synchronous.   The
</I>&gt;<i> AgentUpdate Packet and ViewerEffect Packet are the two packets that
</I>&gt;<i> are sent from the client the most often, so, these alone should reduce
</I>&gt;<i> the threads required per client significantly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Testers:
</I>&gt;<i> What users and testers should look for, however, is the Simulator
</I>&gt;<i> suddenly disconnecting all users.    If this occurs, then, likely, the
</I>&gt;<i> UDP server is not moving fast enough to effectively process packets
</I>&gt;<i> for the current amount of users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Developers:
</I>&gt;<i> It's time to look at the length of time it takes for packet processors
</I>&gt;<i> to finish processing and decide if the packet handler should be
</I>&gt;<i> executed synchronously or asynchronously.
</I>&gt;<i> Any synchronously processed packet is processed in the thread context
</I>&gt;<i> beginning with the UDPServer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, this will allow us to increase the number of concurrently
</I>&gt;<i> connected users further.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i>
