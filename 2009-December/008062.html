<PRE>Hi

A friend of mine is currently working on a Mumble voice module for OpenSim, together with his development team. He will release it as open source, as soon as it is finished.

He already did first tests with Mumble and OpenSim and he already got speaker indication working (what is missing in the existing Freeswitch voice module) as well as lip sync. Voice gestures seem to require some changes in the OpenSim region server, to trigger these body movements. He will also implement spacial sound, what can be done nicely with the existing Mumble interface. On the viewer side SLVoice.exe will be replaced by a Mumble voice plugin with a compatible interface towards the viewer. This way existing Vivox license issues should also be overcome.

This voice module will be the first, beside the Vivox voice module, that supports all features required for professional meetings in OpenSim worlds. Because my friend has big corporations as customers, he additionally needs a voice solution that can be run behind a firewall (what is not possible with Vivox).

He is optimistic that a first version of the Mumble voice module will be ready for tests during the first half of January. I will keep you informed.

Snoopy

Hi

Just wanted to add - we worked on using Mumble with Opensim about a year
back. We didnt integrate Mumble client with SL client but ran it
independently. There is also a small server which runs on the client
machine and listens for avatar positions sent to it from an in-world script
on an avatar attachment. I can share more details and code if anyone is
interested.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but at some point presumably they'll stop supporting old.  And, this

&gt;<i> &gt; wasn't just for the protocol between server and client, but also

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As such, if something was made a couple of years ago, it will take some
