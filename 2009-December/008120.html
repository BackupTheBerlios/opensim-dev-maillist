<PRE>Dear Adam:

This seems like a good idea as all of your ideas are and I support it. Lets move forward.

Perhaps one way to move forward is to help to encourage patches that meet this vision. I am thinking of an example with notes and TODO so that others can take the example subroutine and add patches to follow your vision.

Charles

Bumpity Bump. If I don&#8217;t hear
any comments on this, I&#8217;m going to assume the proposal is sound and have carte
blanche to break OpenSim at my whim. ;)

Subject: [Opensim-dev] Refactoring SceneObjectGroup - Introducing
Components
 
Hi Folks,
 
I&#8217;ve got a fairly complicated proposal to deliver here today
&#8211; the short of it is; I&#8217;d like to go ahead and replace the current Scene Object
representation model &#8211; at a fairly comprehensive &amp; complete level. Some of
you have had the misfortune of working with SceneObjectPart/SceneObjectGroup
and should understand what I am talking about.
 
There are several stages to this proposal &#8211; but I would like
to talk about today the first big one (and a small outline of the larger
project &#8211; the reason for this being some of the later details require a little
more nutting out before I have a complete proposal for them).
 
So &#8211; the larger proposal in a nutshell; I would like to:
&#183;         Merge SceneObjectGroup &amp; SceneObjectPart
&#183;         Enable full inheritance &amp; linking (ie,
hierarchical linking)
&#183;         Make programming with SceneObjects possible
&amp; reasonable from the outside (ie have a clean API).
&#183;         Provide the ability to extend SceneObjects with
&#8220;components&#8221; to introduce new properties and behaviours.
 
The item I&#8217;d like to talk about today would be implementing
Components. Components are small C# classes that may be attached to any
SceneObject arbitrarily. 
 
A component is any class inheriting from IComponent &#8211;
IComponent carries only two properties; a serialisation property (returns the
current &#8216;state&#8217; for serialisation purposes), and a type property (which
recognises the &#8216;type&#8217; of component that it is) &#8211; components allow you to attach
arbitrary data to an object for the purposes of interacting with a region
module. For instance, a &#8220;Mesh&#8221; module (which is my current best example) would
have a MeshComponent that included all the extra data to tag an object with
related to meshes &#8211; which would get serialised and passed around with the main
object. When deserialized &#8211; a &#8220;Factory&#8221; handles making sure the MeshComponent
is deserialized with the main object.
 
I&#8217;ve attached a document which is my current state of the
whole proposal which includes some examples &amp; more detail. Please note that
Phase 2 is not finalised yet &#8211; and some decisions were discussed about changing
two facets in particular.
&#183;         Enabling inheritance of components+sceneobject
to make speedy-classes for common use cases (eg PrimObject inherits
PrimComponent and SceneObject)
&#183;         Allowing more than one factory potentially; for
manufacturing said speedy-classes.
&#183;         Note that these shorthand classes would still
use the standard .Has / .Get methods; they would just return &#8216;this&#8217; where the
particular component type is concerned.
 
To begin with &#8211; I would like to implement components as an
extra non-serialised property of the SceneObjectPart; this will occur very
shortly after 0.7 is tagged; which I would like to do once ROBUST covers all
the main services (I heard something about late-december/early-jan); this first
stage should not break anything in particular &#8211; however once that Is complete,
I would like to migrate properties into components in order to modularised the
codebase better.
 
An example of this would be PrimData &#8211; primdata is unique to
the Second Life use case, and irrelevant to others; in this case, we&#8217;ll move
PrimData into a commonly accessed component (eg
&#8220;SceneObject.Get&lt;PrimData&gt;.Hollow = 0.9f;&#8221;) &#8211; once the move to components
is complete for the common data; then creating the final SceneObject class
which merges SceneObjectGroup+Part should be a fairly painless process.
 
Please take a read of the document attached for more
information &#8211; and I am very keen to hear anyones thoughts as to use cases that
this model will make more difficult; or could not support. The goal with this
project is to make OpenSim support more with less &#8211; allowing third party
modules to really take OpenSim as a framework to the next level; and make a
more modular server for other clients &amp; platforms.
 
Thanks!
 
Adam
