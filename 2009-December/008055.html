<PRE>So far, I know of three Open Source OpenWave servers.

FedOne
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/wave-protocol">http://code.google.com/p/wave-protocol</A>

This is the Google version, available under Apache License 2.0.  There are a
lot of us running these servers.  I have one up and running that any of you
are free to use.  Being the standard reference server, lots of people are
developing around it.  It is still very primative, but has some neat stuff.
Key features:  It federates with other FedOne servers, including the Google
Sandbox.  I've successfully federated with Google Sandbox and other FedOne
servers in the past, but recently have been having problems federating.  The
production Google Server does not yet support Federation.  It also supports
not only the simple console client that comes with it, but QWaveClient, a
nice little client written in QT.  I've used the QWaveClient to connect to
my server.  The other thing that I find most annoying about FedOne is that
currently waves are not persistent between server sessions.

Ruby on Sails
<A HREF="http://github.com/danopia/ruby-on-sails">http://github.com/danopia/ruby-on-sails</A>
This is written by a young man named Dan.  I don't think he's thought much
about the licensing issues.  I've run this on my server, although I don't
usually have it running.  It looks really nice.  I'm told that it now
supports Federation with FedOne servers, but I haven't tested it yet.  There
is not a standard client/server protocol defined yet, but the folks working
on FedOne appear to be evolving one and the Dan at Ruby on Sails is working
on getting his code to with the emerging client server protocol.  I hope and
expect to be able to use a Ruby on Sails Client with a FedOne server soon,
as well as using a QWaveClient or the FedOne Console Client to connect to
Ruby on Sails Server.  I believe waves are persistent on this server.

PyGoWave
<A HREF="http://pygowave.net">http://pygowave.net</A>
This was an early effort to build a Wave Server in Python.  Last I knew
PyGoWave did not Federate or talk with other clients.  I believe the waves
are persistent.

Both FedOne and Ruby on Sails require that you have an XMPP server up and
running.  I've been using the OpenFire XMPP server, although I've heard
others have had success with jabberd and Prosody.

Hope this helps.  I'd love to chat about collaborating.  Adding Wave
capabilities to Naali sounds especially interesting.

Aldon

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Opensim Wave?


Hello,

Is the google wave server component open sourced as well? I read somewhere
that only the wave protocol is open, and that google will be the only
service
provider for now. Concerning functionality, i personally like the idea of a
realtime collaborative text editor for the web. When it comes to this
functionality, the libinfinote library(lgpl) from the gobby project may be
interesting. It's then just a matter of creating a js-client with orbited as
comet server, and later switch to websockets when they are supported by the
main browsers.

With ogre as the renderer in Naali, it may be not so much work to integrate
an
in-world awesomium browser that uses this technology.
