</I>The archiving utility should not be a region module -- region modules 
are addons that need to access scenes, and the archiving utility doesn't 
need that. The only thing it needs are references to an IAssetService 
and IInventoryService.

The command line you wrote, save/load oar, needs access to scene and 
uses the archiving utility. As such, it needs a [very thin] region 
module, the one you already have for all the checks and balances, and 
then should use the general archiving utility.

I think the archiving utility should be part of a dll called 
OpenSim.Archives or, if you want to gather more goodies in a larger dll, 
OpenSim.Utilities.

The point is that lots of other tools that have nothing to do with 
scenes (hence, nothing to do with region modules) will make use the the 
archiving utility -- i.e. getting a listing of a user's inventory and 
packing/unpacking it, along with the corresponding assets, into/from a 
ball. That is 100% generic, has nothing to do with scenes.
