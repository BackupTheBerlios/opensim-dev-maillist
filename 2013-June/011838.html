<PRE>kenvc, can yiu please reopen this Mantis entry..

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=5122">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=5122</A>

Its definitely not fixed.  I observed the same problem just a few 
weeks ago in a fresh 0.7.6 dev master using a new MySQL data base and 
all content loaded from saved OARS and IARs.  So its not legacy data 
base or things like that.  I now know its one save OAR that must have 
allowed this thruogh

It shows a pink hair attachment appearing in the middle of the screen 
when any avatar (including HG visitors) with a HUD of any kind (not 
just an AO) is in use. It looks the same as the snapshot attached to 
the mantis entry with files name...

2012-10-13-OpenSim-0.7.5-OSGrid-Vue-6400-Central-HUD.jpg

I managed this time to track down the item via its UUID in the data 
base and deleted it manually there and the issue went away.  But of 
course that means any OARs out that that has this buggy item in it 
will reappear at any time.

I can add this note as a comment to the Mantis area if you wish.

I always note that a problem with Mantis is that once closed normal 
reporter style users cannot add further comments, or change the 
status to open to allow them to be added.  Is that right?

</PRE>
