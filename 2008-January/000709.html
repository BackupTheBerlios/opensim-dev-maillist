<PRE>Sure thing, that example was just pouring out of my fingers, the vector syntax came from X3D and I don't like it either.
 
I would like some really standard albeit compact way of representing vectors/quaternions; surely, there must be something like MathML that does that? I'm thinking the pragmatics of html while still retaining extensibility of xml.
 
Also, by creating some 'model' group/part/shape classes that's more occupied with transformation of data than transformation of state, these classes could provide PrimitiveBaseShapes for the protocol, as well as more API-and-Xml-friendly property accessors.
 
I can start working on a suggestion sometime next week, if you all don't just race me to it.
 
Best,
/Stefan

None of us are in love with them, but better&gt; approaches haven't popped up yet.&gt; &gt; Probably because nobody has made any attempt at discussing and proposing changes; this mail was an attempt to get that ball rolling.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There was some energy poured into analyzing how attachments were communicated; that would be a good start, if we could get a wiki page up just detailing what we know about scene entities.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * Related, we need to revise the xml serialization scheme and the db&gt; &gt; * schemes. The xml scheme should be user-friendly to the point where&gt; &gt; * you should be confident to create and edit objects in notepad,&gt; &gt; * basically. This is not the case at the moment. Massive duplication,&gt; &gt; * weird bit values and non-intuitive value ranges are king at the&gt; &gt; * moment.&gt; &gt; Given the amount of data in a prim, editing in notepad always is going&gt; to be a bad idea. :) I think we've got something like 40 fields that&gt; have to be sensible for the prim to work.&gt; &gt; &gt;From working extensibly with shapes and serialization, I know that this is not the case.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, consider something like&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;Object position=&quot;128.0 128.0 23.0&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;Rectangle extrusion=&quot;straight&quot; scale=&quot;1.0 2.0 5.0&quot; offset=&quot;root&quot;/&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;Circle extrusion=&quot;sphere&quot; scale=&quot;1 1 1&quot; offset=&quot;0 0 1&quot;/&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;/Object&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that doesn't look like a bad idea at all to me.&gt; &gt; That would be pretty sucky to parse though. We should really be&gt; breaking out the position bits into seperate data so they can be&gt; accessed directly, and so there is no ambiguity of X Y Z or Z Y X for&gt; values.&gt; &gt; I do like the approach of having sane zero values for things so they can&gt; be left out if they are defaults. I think that will make life a bit&gt; easier for making future portability here.&gt; &gt; -Sean&gt; &gt; -- &gt; __________________________________________________________________&gt; &gt; Sean Dague Mid-Hudson Valley&gt; sean at dague dot net Linux Users Group&gt; <A HREF="http://dague.net">http://dague.net</A> <A HREF="http://mhvlug.org">http://mhvlug.org</A>&gt; &gt; There is no silver bullet.
