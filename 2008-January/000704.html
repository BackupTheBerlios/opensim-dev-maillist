It would be good to see a proposal on how to change those objects into
something better.  None of us are in love with them, but better
approaches haven't popped up yet.

&gt;<i> * Related, we need to revise the xml serialization scheme and the db

Given the amount of data in a prim, editing in notepad always is going
to be a bad idea. :)  I think we've got something like 40 fields that
have to be sensible for the prim to work.

</I>
My theory on data migration is to build something akin to the
db:migration model in rails, which will let us version forward in an
incremental way.  I think past experience has proven that we aren't
going to have a fixed db structure for a while, so flag days and full
burn downs aren't the best approach.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
