<PRE>The focus on using XMPP as the chat glue is what is especially attractive to
me.  It seems as if there are several interesting aspects to that.

The simplest being the suggestion from dirk.
  a.. JID: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">firstname.lastname at userserver</A>
  b.. roster == friends
Beyond that, tying it to groups.
  a.. JID: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">groupname at userserver</A>/group
  b.. roster == group members
Another interesting aspect is tying it to location.  e.g.
  a.. JID: sim/x/y/<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">z at userserver</A>/location
  b.. roster == nearby avatars
This could also be done to support channels.  e.g.
  a.. JID: sim/x/y/z/<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">channel at userserver</A>/location
could be used for other channels.  With that sim/x/y/z/<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">0 at userserver</A>/location
would be the same as sim/x/y/<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">z at userserver</A>/location
Other areas that this would help with.  The debug channel would then be
available via XMPP providing the sort of debugging that dirk suggested in a
previous email.

This would also be of great use for people building external systems to
connect via XMPP.

Another piece of functionality that would be very interesting would be to
expose search functionality via XMPP e.g.
  a.. JID: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">searchstring at userserver</A>/searchtype
  b.. roster = search results
The search type could be optional.  If it is omitted, it would imply all.
It could be people or places returning the user JIDs as the roster, as
decribed above for people searches or the location JIDs as described above
for places (or popularplaces) searches.  For all, it could return a mix of
both people and locations.

Objects could also have their own JID
  a.. JID: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">UUID at userserver</A>/object
For people, this could provide an alternative way of contacting the person,
but mostly, it would be direct communications with an object.  I'm not sure
what an object should return as its roster.

Also, following Stefan's suggestion, there could be extentions as necessary
as created by the programmers. e.g
  a.. JID: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">userfield at userserver</A>/userextention
To be defined by the programmer as necessary.

I don't know XMPP well enough to know if there is any sort of self discovery
mechanism, If there isn't, having some sort of
  a.. JID: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">directory at userserver</A>/directory
type functionality to list the different methods available via XMPP would be
a nice feature, particularly when user extentions have been added.

Just random thoughts.

    a.. JID: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">firstname.lastname at userserver</A>
    b.. roster == friends
  also, allowing login from jabber client would be useful --- that way you
could control your avatar from a jabber client (and use commands like
&quot;/teleport to Core Dump/127/45/32&quot; and similar). if you assign lower prio to
the external jabber presence, you could even have both external jabber
client online and the avatar via secondlife client online :-)

      cheers,
      dirk
