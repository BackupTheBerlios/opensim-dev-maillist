We are using Python for scripting, on OpenSim the .NET IronPython. We 
have actually two implementations of that now: a separate scripting 
environment with an own event manager etc. where you can script in py, 
and a simple region module loader that can load python written region 
modules, just using the normal .net interface for region modules that 
OpenSim provides (the c#-written scene object basically). We'll publish 
those soonish, they are nothing too fancy though, but work.

IronPython supports basically everything c# does, but in Python, so it 
is fully OO (even more than C# in the sense that e.g. classes are 
objects too and can be passed as arguments etc), while being dynamic as 
in being interpreted and using dynamic typing. So I don't know why OSSL 
would be interesting for me/us, but am curious to learn if there is 
some reason .. restricted execution and efficiency come to mind. I have 
not looked at how it being 'bastardized c#' actually works. For our 
company (ex-Kyperjokki , now Playsign) being standard py is more 
valuable anyway, is we can reuse the code we have for other envs too.

With py or not, as long as OpenSim is depending on .NET, I think it 
would be worthwhile to see if the new/coming .NET scripting stuff would 
support the scripting needs there well - I am talking about the Dynamic 
Languages Runtime (DLR) that Microsoft is now working on. If i have 
understood correctly, the DLR provides means to define scripting 
functions/objects/methods/datatypes so that any .net script language, 
the prominent ones being IronPython and IronRuby I guess (and VB?-) can 
use them. Then there is the basic infrastructure for dealing with the 
script engines, scopes etc. So I guess one way to implement the Linden 
script on .net would be to make a IronLinden using Microsoft.Scripting 
(the DLR is implemented as the Microsoft.Scripting dll). The IronPython 
2.0 releases come with a minimal implementation of a dummy language, if 
someone wants to check an example (I haven't looked at it).

Just yesterday they updated the DLR spec, below is a quote from the 
IronPython list. I've experimented with OpenSim scripting using the 
IronPython 2.0 alpha series (5 and 6) to get a feel of that new hosting 
(embedding) API to be able to give feedback to the Microsoft folks 
before the api is finished. Now would be a good time for anyone 
interested in scripting on .net to do so.

To: 	  <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">users at lists.ironpython.com</A>

We&#8217;ve updated the hosting API spec for the DLR and uploaded it to: 
<A HREF="http://compilerlab.members.winisp.net/">http://compilerlab.members.winisp.net/</A> (as DOC 
<A HREF="http://compilerlab.members.winisp.net/dlr-spec-hosting.doc">http://compilerlab.members.winisp.net/dlr-spec-hosting.doc</A> or as PDF 
<A HREF="http://compilerlab.members.winisp.net/dlr-spec-hosting.pdf">http://compilerlab.members.winisp.net/dlr-spec-hosting.pdf</A>).

We&#8217;ve been working on updating the code to reflect the spec and you&#8217;ll 
see some of that in IronPython 2.0 Alpha 7.&#160;(...) Our current status is 
that we have ScriptEngine, ScriptScope, ObjectOperations, and 
ScriptSource (...) planning going forward is to work on replacing 
ScriptEnvironment w/ ScriptRuntime, switching to use MBRO objects 
instead of the interfaces we use today (completing the remoting story), 
and other small tweaks.&#160; In February we&#8217;ll be looking at finishing up 
the support for multiple engines in the same app domain, defining and 
implementing the full set of configuration/options, and general 
fit-and-finish work.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Subject: [Opensim-dev] Making LSL Functions moduled.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm beggining to see a lot of interest in people adding custom LSL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functions -- it's a great idea, but I suspect we will be running into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the situation soon where it would be better if we could abstract 
</I>&gt;<i> these,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and then load them from assemblies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Eg, someone suggested adding XMPP functions, and I've been thinking 
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; adding a MySQL.NET wrapper - both prime candidates for being loaded 
</I>&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a module rather than embedded into OpenSim's .NET script engine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyone got an indication on how long that would take to change?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
