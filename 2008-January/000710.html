<PRE>*general enthusiasm regarding implementing more and stable protocol*

&gt;<i> Date: Fri, 18 Jan 2008 18:26:14 -0500&gt; From: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">teravus at gmail.com</A>&gt; To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; Subject: [Opensim-dev] Hey all, Grid Comms, border crossings, Request for comments, red regions and tolerance to network failure.&gt; &gt; Hi everyone&gt; &gt; People are practically begging for more reliable grid comms. So,&gt; naturally, I want to give it to them. I really want to do it with&gt; the least amount of work/turnaround time as possible. We've all got&gt; only so much time to work on something.&gt; &gt; So, at least with border crossings, I've observed a few phenomena&gt; &gt; 1. Fly off into infinity&gt; 2. Get put arbitrarily in a spot in the region you were previously in&gt; and get stuck there&gt; &gt; Item one is almost exclusively from child agent disconnects (where a&gt; region that you're a child agent in says, 'close was called' but you&gt; didn't actually want it to). Eventually the region will turn red on&gt; your minimap.&gt; &gt; Item number two seems to be corruption of some kind. It could be a&gt; race condition or lack of synchronization with the client.&gt; &gt; Fact: When a region disconnects on your minimap in llsimulators, the&gt; region will appear again.&gt; &gt; If you watch the console you'll see that the region that you're a root&gt; agent in sends the 'disable simulator' message and then the 'enable&gt; simulator' message.&gt; &gt; This implies that when you get disconnected as a child agent from the&gt; region you're a child in, 'that region' mentions the fact that 'it&gt; lost you' to the region you're a root agent in. Then the region&gt; you're a root agent in sends the 'disable simulator message' and then&gt; sends the 'enable simulator' message to reconnect you to that region.&gt; &gt; Fact: When a region goes red on your minimap with opensim, the region&gt; will never be available again until you relog and when you try to&gt; cross the border, you will fly off into infinity. Even if the region&gt; hasn't turned red *yet*, you will still fly off into infinity.&gt; &gt; So, MW suggested I post a request for comments on this topic since it&gt; has some potential to affect everyone.&gt; &gt; Here's what I propose&gt; &gt; When sending a child agent notification, the current region is also&gt; included so that, when a child agent disconnects, the region can tell&gt; the neighbor that the child is a root agent in to re-inform the agent&gt; of the neighbor.&gt; &gt; Add a routine that the clientview.close method calls in the scene&gt; which checks for a child agent and sends a 'I lost em' message to the&gt; region the agent came from. From there the simulator with the root&gt; agent in it can make the choice to send the child the reconnect&gt; messages or not.&gt; &gt; This will ensure that a child agent connection is established.&gt; &gt; Ensuring that a child agent connection is established will make border&gt; crossings more successful and less of Item one from above will occur.&gt; &gt; I'm not looking to re-do the protocol entirely. I want to make it&gt; more tolerant to the inevitable network failure. I'm not looking to&gt; change much.&gt; &gt; I also don't really want to change any of the existing protocol stuff.&gt; We need a child agent data update anyway.. and it's half&gt; implemented already in the OSG1 code(for a month now).&gt; &gt; The child agent data update contains things like.. child throttles..&gt; so the neighbor sims don't flood the avatar, where the avatar is in&gt; world and what their draw distance is so that we can enable sending&gt; prim to agents in other regions.&gt; &gt; I'm not looking to make OSG2 here. I'm looking to make OSG1 work better.&gt; &gt; With that.. comments anyone?&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
