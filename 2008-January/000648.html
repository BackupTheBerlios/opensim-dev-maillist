&gt;<i> Date: Mon, 7 Jan 2008 07:33:46 -0500&gt; From: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">GobiG-SL at earthlink.net</A>&gt; To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">stefan at tribalmedia.se</A>&gt; Subject: CentralScripting offers Free Office/Build spaces in CentralGrid to scripters and OpenDev members&gt; &gt; Stefan
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you for your reply regarding My hopes and plans for CentralGrid.&gt; &gt; As you know, I am offering free access and use of my CentralGrid parcel &gt; (located on one of the AVC Sims) to anyone involved with scripting and &gt; the scripting language for OpenSim and SecondLife (details below).&gt; &gt; I am (compared to anyone with the skills to actually create OpenSim &gt; code) a newbie, but I believe in OpenSim. In fact, I believe that most &gt; everyone may soon have their own SIM and I believe they may actually use &gt; a SIM as their own primary 'homepage' -- instead of anything else (like &gt; facebook, etc.).&gt; &gt; So, being a bit of an adventurer, I am determined to participate in the &gt; growth and future direction of OpenSim in whatever positive way I can.&gt; &gt; To that end, I have purchased a small parcel in CentralGrid which I will &gt; devote to Scripters and those in the OpenSim development process. And I &gt; have also arranged to control a 1/4 COMMERCIAL SIM there as well. I &gt; have also created a group on secondlife named CentralScripting (which I &gt; will replicate into CentralGrid when groups are activated there).&gt; &gt; I am offering Free Access and Free Space for storefront displays, office &gt; space, and Building/Sandbox to anyone who is willing to:&gt; [a] Join the SL Group named CentralScripting; &gt; [b] on the OpenSim dev mailing list and most importantly&gt; [c] willing to work and bring about scripted content in CentralGrid as &gt; well as other Metaverses - as they become stable.&gt; [d] share the parcel's resources equitably with other interested &gt; scripters and developers.&gt; &gt; Of course, if this offer is vastly oversubscribed then all those who &gt; subscribe will have to meet and determine ways to share the resources &gt; fairly - I feel certain that can be achieved.&gt; &gt; My ultimate goal is to always be able to establish a presence for the &gt; members of CentralScripting - in any metaverse which has sufficient size &gt; and stability to need scripted content for it's residents and businesses.&gt; &gt; Obviously there are scripting language issues and content portability &gt; issues to be resolved as the new Open metaverses grow. There also are &gt; Scripting language capabilities which need to be &gt; created/improved/expanded. Additionally, most builders, scriptors, and &gt; other 'content' artists I have spoken with indicate issues with portable &gt; inventory and copyright/licensing. &gt; &gt; These are ALL Real issues which need real solutions. And, I am looking &gt; for people who are willing to work through these issues towards the goal &gt; of resolving them all.&gt; &gt; So, here's a recap of my offer:&gt; Join the centralScripting group in SecondLife, then create an avatar &gt; name on CentralGrid. Then participate in the goals I have outlined &gt; above -- If you or your associates will agree and do these things then I &gt; will grant free access to my parcel in CentralGrid for CentralScripting &gt; members until March 31st, 2008. Additionally, I am interested in &gt; extending this offer into the future, but will have to determine the &gt; best way to fund its tier costs after March 31st. Larger parcels are &gt; available for this endeavor in the future if it is successful.&gt; &gt; Interested? Obviously this offer is made to foster good works so anyone &gt; found to be causing grief in central grid or to the SL group named &gt; CentralScripting, will be subject to careful review.&gt; &gt; Please forward this offer of mine to anyone whom you feel can be part of &gt; the Metaverse solution as well as the OpenSim Developers mailing lists.&gt; &gt; Any questions? &gt; &gt; Regards,&gt; &gt; Gobi Greenwood, SL Avatar&gt; Gobi Greenwood, CG Avatar&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">GobiG-SL at Earthlink.Net</A>
