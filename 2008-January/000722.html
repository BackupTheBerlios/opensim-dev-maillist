Sounds great :)

&gt;<i> XMPP support.

It is an interesting take.

Just yesterday actually we somehow ended up in wondering how something 
is in Jabber, and kind of recalling what exactly is going on with jabber 
related stuff. We didn't go on to XMPP then, but yah it was an 
interesting RFC to begin with .. I haven't followed most recent 
devepments too much, so don't know if it relates to those other things 
like SIP etc. But I figure many things in Jabber made/make sense to 
begin with.

Some ppl here reportedly like C# so I guess this Java example is close 
enough so is nice to read for you :p

I wonder, how do you see xmmp used - are there some design/spec/ideas 
written already?

Obviously sending chat messages is something to consider, and I suppose 
really straightforward too .. just a protocol implementataion,

but the architecture needed for that is kind of interesting more 
generally too, or i don't know, but and interesting read anyway .. 
things like:

)


    Is Anybody out There? Detecting Presence

[..]

This will give you the status of a user at a given point in time, but 
you may need to have this information in real time; for example, to 
update a list of contacts in a client application. You can get this 
information in real time by implementing the |RosterListener| interface, 
as shown here:

|<i>    roster.addRosterListener(new RosterListener() {
</I>
        public void entriesAdded(Collection arg0) {
            // New contacts have been added
            ...
        }||

	public void presenceChanged(String arg0) {
            // The presence status of this user has changed
            ...
        }|

&quot;&quot;&quot;

Well, sounds certainly sensible for 'telephony' at least, messages and 
talk I guess?

Ah but of course also avatar information can easily be central in 
messaging too, no? Or I don't know.

Interesting to think what all kinds of stuff ppl actually want to go as 
the presenceChanged data, hm, like mood mappings to emoticons or what? I 
guess I should see/read how it is used in gtalk and whatnot and quit 
laming o:p

so just read this rambling is a +1 on 'sounds like could be interesting' 
or as 'easily worthwhile',
/me withdraws to left-behind (or however you are supposed to say 
'takavasen')

&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Kel
</I>&gt;<i>

but humbly enough i hope,
