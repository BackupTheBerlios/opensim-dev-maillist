<PRE>hi all,

first of all - happy 2008! as I've had a bit of time today, I decided to dig
into the intrinsics of attaching stuff. The AttachObject method which is
somewhere in the code is incorrect -  the packet it tries to send to client
is originated by the client in the first place, the command to &quot;attach
stuff&quot; to the viewer is the ObjectUpdate packet with not one but two
elements of ObjectData - the first one being the one for Avatar, and the
second one being for the Thing being attached (suspected: root prim :).
(there's also &quot;attach multiple prims&quot; which i did not dig yet).

The result of these experiments is a super ugly proof of concept which is
not worth committing, but which I think shows up a problem... :
<A HREF="http://opensim.be/dalien/attachment-proof-of-concept.patch">http://opensim.be/dalien/attachment-proof-of-concept.patch</A>

Actually, two problems:

1) attachments != sceneobjects (I think) - well, at least they should not be
saved into backups, etc... (and not sure how they should interact with the
ODE &amp; all - I think they should not)

For the &quot;wear from the ground&quot; it is less of a problem - but for wearing
from inventory (which i did not write anywhere beyond pointless junk) -
reusing the existing rezz code might be a plus - otherwise there is a loooot
of copypaste.


2) the ObjectUpdate needs to combine low-level update for both Avatar and
Prim - which with layered approach (packet sending stuff being in lower
layer relative to InnerScene) will result in a function with a bazillion
parameters.

A lesser evil that I was thinking about is to expose the &quot;partial builder&quot;
functions on the IClientAPI level, which would return parts of the packets,
which could subsequently passed to other IClientAPI packet building
functions.

Thoughts ?
