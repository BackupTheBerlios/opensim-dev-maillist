<PRE>Is this the only communication we have had from CentralGrid via e-mail?

I can tell you that Maltos was on IRC on or about 12-14. At that point he told us a few things:

1. They started operations on 12-1
2. They had 74 users as of 12-14.
3. BCX bank was funding them with L$500000 (or about US$2000).

I can look at our wiki, &quot;opensimulator.org&quot; and find entries by Maltos in the picture gallery giving the impression that these screen shots were all of CentralGrid. This is been de-emphasized.

I can look at our wiki, &quot;opensimulator.org&quot; and find entries by Maltos and Granger as contributors on our development team page with mention of CentralGrid.

In looking at their web site, I can see something called &quot;Atlas Virtual Capital&quot;, which is, I believe, the AVC referred to in this e-mail.

I can also note that a search on the maingrid for the string 'OpenSim' returns a &quot;CentralGrid HQ&quot;

Additionally, in reading the press releases on centralgrid.com, I can see mention by Atlas Virtual Capital that they have created a VentureFund with 100 shares priced at L$5000 each (about US$20) and that this comes with a 1536m parcel on a CentralGrid sim running OpenSim.

My assumption is that the payers of the L$5000 are the majority of the CentralGrid users.

The notecard given out when entering CentralGrid HQ on the maingrid makes reference to the fact that other OpenSim groups have decided that implementing monetary exchange is not important, but CentralGrid has done so.  Also, this notecard indicates that CentralGrid intends to offer its computer facility to other, &quot;smaller&quot; grids to provide a cohesive metaverse under their umbrella and resources.

I have read a number of posts written in the  last month giving the impression that CentralGrid is the only &quot;significant&quot; public grid running OpenSim.

I also have listened to &quot;Eric Reuters&quot; indicate CentralGrid is getting a lot of press lately.

I think it would be very helpful if they would participate in our community on IRC.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: CentralScripting offers Free Office/Build spaces in CentralGrid to scripters and OpenDev members
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Stefan
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your reply regarding My hopes and plans for CentralGrid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you know, I am offering free access and use of my CentralGrid parcel 
</I>&gt;<i> (located on one of the AVC Sims) to anyone involved with scripting and 
</I>&gt;<i> the scripting language for OpenSim and SecondLife (details below).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am (compared to anyone with the skills to actually create OpenSim 
</I>&gt;<i> code) a newbie, but I believe in OpenSim. In fact, I believe that most 
</I>&gt;<i> everyone may soon have their own SIM and I believe they may actually use 
</I>&gt;<i> a SIM as their own primary 'homepage' -- instead of anything else (like 
</I>&gt;<i> facebook, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, being a bit of an adventurer, I am determined to participate in the 
</I>&gt;<i> growth and future direction of OpenSim in whatever positive way I can.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To that end, I have purchased a small parcel in CentralGrid which I will 
</I>&gt;<i> devote to Scripters and those in the OpenSim development process. And I 
</I>&gt;<i> have also arranged to control a 1/4 COMMERCIAL SIM there as well. I 
</I>&gt;<i> have also created a group on secondlife named CentralScripting (which I 
</I>&gt;<i> will replicate into CentralGrid when groups are activated there).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am offering Free Access and Free Space for storefront displays, office 
</I>&gt;<i> space, and Building/Sandbox to anyone who is willing to:
</I>&gt;<i> [a] Join the SL Group named CentralScripting; 
</I>&gt;<i> [b] on the OpenSim dev mailing list and most importantly
</I>&gt;<i> [c] willing to work and bring about scripted content in CentralGrid as 
</I>&gt;<i> well as other Metaverses - as they become stable.
</I>&gt;<i> [d] share the parcel's resources equitably with other interested 
</I>&gt;<i> scripters and developers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, if this offer is vastly oversubscribed then all those who 
</I>&gt;<i> subscribe will have to meet and determine ways to share the resources 
</I>&gt;<i> fairly - I feel certain that can be achieved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My ultimate goal is to always be able to establish a presence for the 
</I>&gt;<i> members of CentralScripting - in any metaverse which has sufficient size 
</I>&gt;<i> and stability to need scripted content for it's residents and businesses.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously there are scripting language issues and content portability 
</I>&gt;<i> issues to be resolved as the new Open metaverses grow. There also are 
</I>&gt;<i> Scripting language capabilities which need to be 
</I>&gt;<i> created/improved/expanded. Additionally, most builders, scriptors, and 
</I>&gt;<i> other 'content' artists I have spoken with indicate issues with portable 
</I>&gt;<i> inventory and copyright/licensing. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These are ALL Real issues which need real solutions. And, I am looking 
</I>&gt;<i> for people who are willing to work through these issues towards the goal 
</I>&gt;<i> of resolving them all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, here's a recap of my offer:
</I>&gt;<i> Join the centralScripting group in SecondLife, then create an avatar 
</I>&gt;<i> name on CentralGrid. Then participate in the goals I have outlined 
</I>&gt;<i> above -- If you or your associates will agree and do these things then I 
</I>&gt;<i> will grant free access to my parcel in CentralGrid for CentralScripting 
</I>&gt;<i> members until March 31st, 2008. Additionally, I am interested in 
</I>&gt;<i> extending this offer into the future, but will have to determine the 
</I>&gt;<i> best way to fund its tier costs after March 31st. Larger parcels are 
</I>&gt;<i> available for this endeavor in the future if it is successful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Interested? Obviously this offer is made to foster good works so anyone 
</I>&gt;<i> found to be causing grief in central grid or to the SL group named 
</I>&gt;<i> CentralScripting, will be subject to careful review.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please forward this offer of mine to anyone whom you feel can be part of 
</I>&gt;<i> the Metaverse solution as well as the OpenSim Developers mailing lists.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any questions? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
