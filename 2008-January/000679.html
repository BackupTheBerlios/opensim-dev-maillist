<PRE>Yes, as I said at the start, how things play together might take a while to get used to. The lib is supposed to create parameterized dynamic sql, so that bit should be injection-aversive.
 
And, by all means, feel free to find other ways to slice the cake; I put it there for us to extend and modify, in the hope that it could function as a help also for people who want to extend our db definitons with their own need for light-weight persistence.
 
I know my code sample was stenographic at best, but I hope to deliver some working code (ideally, shape, part and group) at the end of this week - I have it on my hard disk, just have to 'clean' it from context-specifics.
 
Best,
/Stefan

Could that be done by implementing the very simple asset server as an example ? I propose we would make it work, make tests, comment and try to improve it, then it may serve as a baseline for the other db stuff ?&gt; &gt; --- &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *doh*&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll just post the code; but beware, it doesn't work, it's just to show you how stuff would interact&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Also, the code could probably be cleaner...)&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What to look for:&gt; &gt; * how the Schema is created and populated&gt; &gt; * how the m_keyFieldMapper (that is used to extract primary key from queries) is initialized&gt; &gt; * how the FromReader passes on to FillObject() - the function that will use the Schema to populate the RowMapper (and the PrimitiveBaseShape)&gt; &gt; * How the CRUD and CreateRowMapper functions are really just there to&gt; &gt; get a cleaner interface for the caller.&gt; &gt; I'm a bit concerned about the ability to get SQL injection through the&gt; process (unless I missed something). We need to either put in filter&gt; for that, or use the parametrized SQL for the base drivers to let them&gt; filter that.&gt; &gt; I'm still wrapping my head around all of it, but I like much of what I'm&gt; seeing so far.
