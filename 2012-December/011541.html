@ robert.adams: I wouldn't want to see such a thing happening (a viewer split into multiple applications). Using multiple programs for each task would probably ruin the entire purpose of virtual worlds and the best feature of SL... which is being able to build, explore, chat, and do everything from the world. There's already enough need of external editors to make content in SL... like Photoshop / GIMP for textures, Audition / Audacity for sounds, Blender / 3DsMax for meshes, etc (unless you find them on the internet). I hope that doesn't change personally... a segmented viewer would be nice to see for curiosity, but I hope it wouldn't become an OpenSim default.

@ <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">toni at playsign.net</A>: It's nice to hear that RealXtend is still alive! I haven't checked it out for a while, but last time I did things were pretty awesome. Main issue for me is that the RealXtend viewer was based on a very old viewer 1 fork (compared to this day), and I couldn't imagine using anything SL without the v3 features. I might try it out again if the viewer could be re-based on viewer 3 and have its GUI, the post-processing and visual effects, HTML on prim surfaces, etc. I assume RealXtend has its own mesh support system still so it might not port the one Linden added. Even if not though, it's a good project and I wish you luck as always :)

The SL viewer model is an all in one application &#8211; viewer, editor, chat client, connection manager, &#8230;
 
Maybe a way of attacking the problem is to separate the parts and not think about building one behemoth application that does everything.
 
Some projects (like Radegast or Lumiya) have made interesting progress on a viewer. Maybe content creation can be handled with Blender plugins? Maybe the chat/voice
 client could be one of the gaming services? Maybe the social connection/interaction framework could be Facebook (OK. No one would ever choose Facebook but any service is possible).
 
Then, of course, there is the problem of the client/server protocol. LLLP (my term for &#8220;Linden Lab Legacy Protocol&#8221;) grew organically and had different problems
 to solve (remember the days when SL worked over dialup modems?). An organized, partition-able protocol would go a long way toward making new clients (mobile or continuously connected or &#8230;) and servers (distributed or dynamically reconfigurable or &#8230;) possible.
 It&#8217;s just a new OpenSimulator region module to talk a new language.
 
Anyway, just throwing that out there.

</I>&gt;<i> Just for info that much of what you describe is what we have done and  
</I>&gt;<i> are doing withing realXtend. Yes, the rumors of the death of reX are  
</I>&gt;<i> very much exaggerated :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are more alive than ever before I think actually, quite many  
</I>&gt;<i> substantial projects coming next year etc (at least &gt;1Me in public  
</I>&gt;<i> projects even), it just doesn't show to the Opensim community nor  
</I>&gt;<i> worlds.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also an Android build of Tundra has been made now and is in testing,  
</I>&gt;<i> and there's good progress with websocket+webgl client side now again  
</I>&gt;<i> as well.
