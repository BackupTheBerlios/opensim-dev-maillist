I noticed most users prefer Firestorm and it's considered the best third-party viewer at this day. Although it's a thing of personal preference, I am a bit worried that Firestorm gets all the attention, since I'm not seeing any of the other viewers getting mentioned much since Firestorm is there. Like I said I don't like it because it's very bloated and slow... the ideal viewer for me is one just like the official SL client but with a grid manager, build / upload limits removed, and new features added.

As far as I know the Second Life viewer is GPL licensed, so distributing it should be possible like any other GPL software. Excluding the Havoc library which supposedly caused OpenSim support to go away. Changes unrelated to the Havoc lib should always be GPL too, so if LL adds something that OpenSim viewer can integrate it should be ok. OpenSim is MIT licensed if I remember right, but there's nothing wrong with distributing a MIT code and a GPL one under the same name and website.

Building a viewer from scratch is something I don't believe will happen or needs to happen. It would be an enormous amount of work, only to achieve something very similar to what's already there. The SL viewer just needs work in places where Linden didn't give it much attention, but is well optimized in many areas.

    I much prefer using Firestorm
            for OpenSim
            since developers
              have clearly separated Opensim version
            from the
              SL one. Firestorm
        431 31155 version
        is very powerful and
          there are of course some lacks.
        But Firestorm
        developers are very
          responsive and they opened a section OpenSim
        in their Jira (successfully tested).

      

      
        On the other hand,
              we can always think that people
            who have made a
              server would be best placed
            to make a viewer.
            Except that this
              would lead to a paradoxical
              situation where OpenSim  developers
            ask Linden Lab
            permission to use sources V2/3/4,
            keeping in mind
              that the issue of licenses would
              remain the same that with the SL viewer and the viewer FireStorm.

              

              As for building a viewer from scratch,
                as did our
                realXtend friends
                  .... it's difficult
            to gather enough
              people and get results in
            a significant delay.

              

              GCI
