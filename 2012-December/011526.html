@ jamesh: I'm using the Teapot viewer as well, since it appears to be the only good alternative for me. I don't like Firestorm because it's extremely bloated with all sorts of things and also very laggy and slow. The official SL viewer was usually my choice for OpenSim too... since it's clean, simple, and well optimized. I fully support the idea of Teapot being the base for an official OpenSim viewer, IMO that would be a great choice.

@ wade.schuette: I remember reading that article some time ago, and I agree with it. It also offers a good example of what I'm talking about regarding client + server features; Let's say OpenSim will finally support regions larger than 256 x 256 meters (I believe mega regions aren't exactly that). In order for the SL viewer to recognize whole regions of bigger sizes, changes need to be done to it. With the current way, the OpenSim devs have to go knocking at the doors of the Firestorm team, the Teapot team, the Imprudence team, etc. and tell them &quot;Hey, we just implemented support for regions larger than 256 x 256, when you have free time take a look at our code and if you can figure it out add support to your viewer for this feature&quot;. It just wouldn't work out IMO.

@ rigun: OpenSim always seemed like a very complex code to me. I think the developers who created it are very experienced, so someone to at least maintain an OpenSim viewer should be easy to find. The main worries would be to include new features and bug fixes from the SL viewer which would still be compatible, and code new OpenSim specific features in the viewer (eg: OSSL function highlighting in the script editor window). But again I'm not someone who can know best, so this is just what I assume.

</I>&gt;<i> I have built the Teapot viewer and dabble with it on occasion. While it 
</I>&gt;<i> is not an &quot;official&quot; viewer, it is very solid and a good place to 
</I>&gt;<i> implement things that might find their way into other viewers over time. 
</I>&gt;<i> I think Armin has been busy with viewer development for the MOSES 
</I>&gt;<i> project, but when this split happened, he was slated to develop the 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim FS viewer and said that if things were developed in Teapot, he 
</I>&gt;<i> could possibly work them through the FS QA process.

</I>&gt;<i> Not sure, but maby good to have this
</I>      topic on osgrid forum to ?
&gt;<i> The biggest problem with makeing own viewer. There are not enough
</I>      devs with the right skills.
&gt;<i> Thats the biggest problem. the amount of people that want and can
</I>      spend time for a special opensim viewer.
