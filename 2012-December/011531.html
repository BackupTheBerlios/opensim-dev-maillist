<PRE>Firestorm bloated ? there some bugs that make it not useable for me. As 
example i cannot use teapot because there's no vector copy in edit.
A viewer need to have at least the following extra things.

-Radar
-AO
-Advanced edit tools, like vector copy and texture align, also the wider 
setting with numbers, like hollow = 99
-Mesh view and upload !

Further is the V3 notification system much nicer to have, also the way 
you can arrange buttons.
Sofar i cannot think about more things then what we have inside 
singularity V1

</I>&gt;<i> I much prefer using Firestorm for OpenSim since developers have 
</I>&gt;<i> clearly separated Opensim version from the SL one. Firestorm 431 31155 
</I>&gt;<i> version is very powerful and there are of course some lacks.
</I>&gt;<i> But Firestorm developers are very responsive and they opened a section 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim in their Jira (successfully tested).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, we can always think that people who have made a 
</I>&gt;<i> server would be best placed to make a viewer. Except that this would 
</I>&gt;<i> lead to a paradoxical situation where OpenSim developers ask Linden 
</I>&gt;<i> Lab permission to use sources V2/3/4, keeping in mind that the issue 
</I>&gt;<i> of licenses would remain the same that withthe SL viewer and the 
</I>&gt;<i> viewer FireStorm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for building a viewer from scratch, as did our realXtend friends 
</I>&gt;<i> .... it's difficult to gather enough people and get results in a 
</I>&gt;<i> significant delay.
