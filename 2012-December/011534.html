<PRE>Well, I started to wonder if this is a concern to me because I used to have Greenlife Viewer/Emerald Viewer until I had to uninstall it and go with Emergence Viewer instead. I have tried Phoenix Viewer when it was out, but it was really laggy for me on SL even in sandboxes, and it seemd worser when trying Firestorm Viewer. The only other viable viewer for me to use on SL that I have found is Singularity Viewer. So right now, the only viewers I have on this system is an old v1 SL Viewer, Emergence Viewer, Singularity Viewer, InWorldz Viewer (that I use when connecting to InWorldz as I'm also on there), and Meerkat Viewer (which I used a few times on OpenSims I have connect to OSGrid). The only two viewers I basically use when connecting to SL are Emergence and Singularity.

  I noticed most users prefer Firestorm and it's considered the best third-party viewer at this day. Although it's a thing of personal preference, I am a bit worried that Firestorm gets all the attention, since I'm not seeing any of the other viewers getting mentioned much since Firestorm is there. Like I said I don't like it because it's very bloated and slow... the ideal viewer for me is one just like the official SL client but with a grid manager, build / upload limits removed, and new features added.

  As far as I know the Second Life viewer is GPL licensed, so distributing it should be possible like any other GPL software. Excluding the Havoc library which supposedly caused OpenSim support to go away. Changes unrelated to the Havoc lib should always be GPL too, so if LL adds something that OpenSim viewer can integrate it should be ok. OpenSim is MIT licensed if I remember right, but there's nothing wrong with distributing a MIT code and a GPL one under the same name and website.

  Building a viewer from scratch is something I don't believe will happen or needs to happen. It would be an enormous amount of work, only to achieve something very similar to what's already there. The SL viewer just needs work in places where Linden didn't give it much attention, but is well optimized in many areas.

  I much prefer using Firestorm for OpenSim since developers have clearly separated Opensim version from the SL one. Firestorm 431 31155 version is very powerful and there are of course some lacks.
  But Firestorm developers are very responsive and they opened a section OpenSim in their Jira (successfully tested).


  On the other hand, we can always think that people who have made a server would be best placed to make a viewer. Except that this would lead to a paradoxical situation where OpenSim developers ask Linden Lab permission to use sources V2/3/4, keeping in mind that the issue of licenses would remain the same that with the SL viewer and the viewer FireStorm.

  As for building a viewer from scratch, as did our realXtend friends .... it's difficult to gather enough people and get results in a significant delay.
