<PRE>Hmm, it's been Over Two Years since I wrote this on my old blog:
<A HREF="http://www.daniel.org/blog/2010/09/19/in-unity-a-way-forward/">http://www.daniel.org/blog/2010/09/19/in-unity-a-way-forward/</A>

I wonder what the state of the art is for any viewers based on Unity,
WebGL, or something else?

The LL code base is an evolutionary dead end.  Firestorm does a great job
of making the best of it, and it deserves to be the #1 viewer.  Ongoing
Kudos to the FS team!  Having said that, no TPV (or LL) viewer is going to
catch up to what is possible on a better foundation.

It would be great to see two things happen:
1)  TPV effort consolidate *even more* around Firestorm.. make it be the
one thing that can tide everyone over until there is a non LL-codebase
viewer.
2) see a good pioneering effort based on Unity, WebGL, or something else

As far as I know, we're not close to the capabilities I was writing about
two years ago.  It's a pretty good bet that the gulf between the LL
codebase and what could be done in Unity is even wider now.

</I>&gt;<i> I much prefer using Firestorm for OpenSim since developers have clearly
</I>&gt;<i> separated Opensim version from the SL one. Firestorm 431 31155 version is
</I>&gt;<i> very powerful and there are of course some lacks.
</I>&gt;<i> But Firestorm developers are very responsive and they opened a section
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim in their Jira (successfully tested).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  On the other hand, we can always think that people who have made a server would
</I>&gt;<i> be best placed to make a viewer. Except that this would lead to a
</I>&gt;<i> paradoxical situation where OpenSim developers ask Linden Lab permission
</I>&gt;<i> to use sources V2/3/4, keeping in mind that the issue of licenses would
</I>&gt;<i> remain the same that with the SL viewer and the viewer FireStorm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for building a viewer from scratch, as did our realXtend friends ....
</I>&gt;<i> it's difficult to gather enough people and get results in a significant
</I>&gt;<i> delay.
