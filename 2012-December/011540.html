Indeed -- even in the extreme extent that with Tundra SDK there is no
'the' frontend. By default if you launch the app you just get a black
screen, showing an empty scene (just like Ogre normally when you just
create a window with no content).

The UI's for chat and AVs etc. are written in javascript and are
typically loaded from the net when the client logs in to some service.

So for example if the Opensim community or some TPV team agrees on some
default Avatar &amp; chat bubbles behaviour, with that tech it is easy to do
in a modular fashion.

Again I'm not saying that current realXtend stuff would work for
everyone's (or anyone's :) Opensimulator needs out of the box, but at
least such modularity and customization is implemented there.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] OpenSim's direction after Linden cutting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support, and the possibility of an official OpenSim viewer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ironically, Firestorm is one of the viewers I like least. It's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actually starting to worry me how it's monopolizing all third-party
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; viewers and being the only v3 fork getting any attention at this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; day. Earlier I read that the admin of the Teapot viewer isn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; updating Teapot any more because he's now working for Firestorm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; too... ugh &gt;_&lt; I do appreciate their team's effort of course, but I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't like that it's becoming the only alternative, and I'm not sure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what else to find and use that I'm comfortable with.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But like I explained in the first email, I believe the SL code base
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is the only path we've got rather than a dead end. SL's system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (which OpenSim primarily went with during those years) is a very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complex thing. Implementing all of its features from scratch in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; good and consistent way would be an effort so big there will likely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; never be anyone doing it when SL is already there. There was an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; original viewer once which could render avatars, terrain and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; objects, but that was about it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The list of features and details is too big. The building tools with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grid snapping, arrows to drag / rotate objects, texture position
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; editing, etc. The avatar customization menu, where you customize
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worn shapes / skins / alpha masks / clothing. Avatar physics, such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as clothing fluttering in the wind. The terrain editor with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; raise / lower / flatten / smooth tools. The IM / chat / groups
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; systems with all their sub-features. Voice chat support. Sculpt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; primitives and mesh rendering. Ability to play media on a prim and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use HTML pages on object surfaces. The windlight sky and environment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (which can also be set as a parcel property). Particles, sounds,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spinning objects (llTargetOmega) and the many things you do with LSL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scripts. Post-processing with bloom, depth of field, bump-mapping,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All this and more would take beyond a decade to re-create from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scratch, and I couldn't imagine a new viewer ever doing them all as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well as Second Life. If anyone would ever get that done from zero as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part of a FOSS viewer, I will consider them a scientist that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deserves a job at NASA :) I'm actually surprised even LL did so much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in just 8 years, but what was achieved is really impressive. Overall
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I just don't think it's a possible goal, and at the same time I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't believe OpenSim can expect other dev teams to maintain them a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SL viewer (just what I think). With Firestorm taking up everything,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm already having a hard time finding a viewer good for me to use,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I'd like to know what can be expected in the recent future.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm, it's been Over Two Years since I wrote this on my old blog:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.daniel.org/blog/2010/09/19/in-unity-a-way-forward/">http://www.daniel.org/blog/2010/09/19/in-unity-a-way-forward/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I wonder what the state of the art is for any viewers based on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unity, WebGL, or something else?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The LL code base is an evolutionary dead end.  Firestorm does a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; great job of making the best of it, and it deserves to be the #1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; viewer.  Ongoing Kudos to the FS team!  Having said that, no TPV (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; LL) viewer is going to catch up to what is possible on a better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; foundation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It would be great to see two things happen:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1)  TPV effort consolidate *even more* around Firestorm.. make it be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the one thing that can tide everyone over until there is a non
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; LL-codebase viewer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) see a good pioneering effort based on Unity, WebGL, or something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; else
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As far as I know, we're not close to the capabilities I was writing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about two years ago.  It's a pretty good bet that the gulf between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the LL codebase and what could be done in Unity is even wider now.
