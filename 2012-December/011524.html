is a pretty good answer.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hey everyone. I've been away from OpenSim for a while but got back. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since last time I've been around, I read about Linden's decision to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cut OpenSim support from their viewer due to some crazy licenses with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their physics engine. The rights and wrongs have been discussed and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are not the point of this email. But this decision means that in some 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> senses, OpenSim will become completely separate from Linden's SL, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some fundamental things might change. I wanted both to ask what 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exactly is going to happen, but also post my own suggestion. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Obviously I'm not someone who can say what's good and bad, but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> personally this is what I strongly believe OpenSim should do and go for.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The way I see things, OpenSim has primarily been a server-side for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Second Life during its existence. Even if its purpose is a general 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> virtual worlds platform, SL was the only usable viewer in practice. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now that LL cut its support, it's in the situation of having no exact 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client to be used with. There are many third-party viewers that will 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continue supporting OpenSim, but IMHO they can't be considered a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reliable source in the long term. I assume most of them have their 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> own developers which take decisions independently from the OpenSim 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> team. If one of those viewers dies for instance, it's up to the user 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to go looking for another one that's still under development. Apart 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the fact that people have to hunt for a viewer, this situation 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also kept OpenSim from being able to make changes that would require 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viewer modifications as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My opinion is that OpenSim won't get far if it relies on random 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viewer forks to be used with at this point. We are not a clear 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standard technology, unlike web browsers for instance where you can 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use Apache to host and FireFox to browse, both unrelated and a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> variety of choices available for each. This is not to say OpenSim 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be unusable with viewers unrelated to SL, since that would go 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against its purpose. But the SL viewer is a very large and complex 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing, and there will surely never be anyone making a client from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scratch which will implement all of its features, look as good, be as 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fast, as bug free, etc. The building and prim editing tools, the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> terrain editor, the avatar and mesh system, the rendering features, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the GUI... it's unlikely anyone will properly re-write all that from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> zero when the SL viewer exists and works fine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is why I believe we need our own official viewer, developed by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and with the OpenSim server, and based on one of the Second Life 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viewers. Apart from the fact that people will know they don't depend 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on someone else to make them a viewer, it would allow client + server 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes to be done for the first time, rather than having to stay 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> within the SL viewer's limits. If that doesn't happen, I don't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believe we'll ever become a better virtual worlds platform outside of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SL's shadow. I remember the days of RealXtend (I heard it's dead now) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which took the SL viewer in one hand, OpenSim in another, and created 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its very own project which was completely amazing for those days (SL 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now has mesh support and better graphics so it makes RealXtend less 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> special at this day). My personal opinion is that it's time OpenSim 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does something similar.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it was me, I'd say grab the latest SL viewer without the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restrictive Havoc library and make OpenSim viewer from that. If 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Linden adds a nice feature to theirs which we can copy over, sure 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing, but otherwise it can go its own separate way. On the other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hand, it would be a good aim to allow previous SL viewers to still 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connect to OpenSim, though they wouldn't recognize some of its 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific features then. I know OS and SL and under two different 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> licenses, but that doesn't make it wrong to distribute both on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same website and as part of the same project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What does the core team of OpenSim think about this? Are there any 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plans or will to go in this direction? Or does anyone believe that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead we should continue providing support for SL's features and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have OpenSim users find their own clients like until now? I believe 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is an important question, and would like to know what to expect 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the future. Personally I really hope something in this direction 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be decided, but I'm not one to know best.
