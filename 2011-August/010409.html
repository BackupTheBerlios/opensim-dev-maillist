<PRE>Hi Justin!

Yes, the portal is already divided, not yet each contents though... Fritigern suggests me dividing all of them too.

To say about priority, I personally think until 0.7.2 is officially launched, the most appreciated task would be testing, reporting and submitting patch as many as possible, if they can do that. I am also going to use my most energy into re-checking old existing bugs and fixing them (if I have time to do that before releasing ... perhaps really tight to me) at least, for a few months. And I am not a superhuman to do both hard job of wiki restructuring and mantis cleaning at the same time. So anyway for me I have no plan to implement my idea for a several months or a year. I'd like to hear people thought of wiki or documentation until I check most of existing issues and can change my priority back to  documentation activities. Again, just as for me. I don't know if Fritigern will do that immediately or not. He seems to find his place in OpenSimulator wiki and struggling to find a way to contribute in it.

Regarding &quot;linking&quot;, as you might concern, the risk of having spam links will way increase. Yes, I as wiki sysop here worry about this kind of nightmare... I think initial contents will take on important role in keeping it relating OpenSimulator. Thus if we introduce it, we'd better gather some links first, using opensim-user mailing list or such, before creating dictionary page.

I still think we'd better put our focus in creating documentations for &quot;Framework Users&quot;, as I have written in my wiki page (<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/User:Makopoppo#My_thought_about_OpenSimulator">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/User:Makopoppo#My_thought_about_OpenSimulator</A>). However, as I read mails posted yesterday and today, I feel that the guide for &quot;Grid Users&quot; (or the way to accessing to them)  is still missing now. Or we'd better recommend our kin software (Aurora-Sim, Diva Distro or such) to the people for personal use instead of lecturing the &quot;guts&quot; of installation of OpenSim core?

&gt;<i> Hi Makopoppo.  Nice to see you on the list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have to say, I'm not in favour of reorganising the wiki structure at this time.  We already have a users and developers division.  As you say, client users are out of focus and I think this is likely to remain so.  Running OpenSim is always going to be a very technical task by most people's standards.  It's an order of complexity more difficult than running a webserver, for instance, and those aren't touched by everyday users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that by far the better use of time is improving documentation.  Although I've gradually [re]written quite a lot over the past year, I'm sure there's still a lot which is incompletely, completely missing or actively misleading (as you hint).  Unfortunately, the combination of doc writing and technical chops is a rare one so I think this will only slowly improve over time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Linking to other documents on the web is definitely encouraged.  But this is an OpenSimulator wiki, so only topics that relate to OpenSimulator are appropriate.  If someone wants to start a general wiki then I think that would be better at a separate site.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would be nice to implement it. And more, I'd like to hear your thought about wiki future as well, especially if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> haven't use OpenSimulator wiki ever or recently. (This is rather my personal activity than as a wiki admin job)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is my idea about what OpenSimulator wiki will be:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * The definition of &quot;User&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator software, as itself, is a framework for 3D virtual environment. It can be included into enterprise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems; i.e. some might want to bundle it into their web servers, groupwares, or such. Some wants to create their own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kins for their use. Some wants to simply use this distribution out-of-the-box. Some doesn't want to own their sims, just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wants to connect to them from their viewers. All of them are &quot;Users&quot;. They will be categorized into three types:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Client Users: Who connects to (or logins to) OpenSimulator-based grids with their viewer, websites, or some other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible methods. They don't need any computer-specific knowledges, they can be teenagers, or even infants.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Documentation for them might be out of focus of OpenSimulator project, it is rather client vendor's area, but having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minimal instruction and links to their document for further information is not so bad idea.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Grid Users: Who connects their OpenSimulator-based regions to OpenSimulator-based grids, or just using it standalone.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They needs minimal knowledge of operation systems, databases, or some other related softwares such as web servers to run
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their own simulators. Since there are already many resources for them, and especially for personal use, kins projects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing great job to make clear documents, maintain them and providing support for years. We can encourage or help them to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improve their documents, such as, providing link list to their pages, or bollowing their article with huge credits.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Framework Users: Who enhances OpenSimulator software for their use. The purpose varies amongst each other, from personal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use to enterprise use. For example, the person who implements *Module, script functions, connectors or such. To say in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another word, who using OpenSimulator as a framework. I personally think that one of the role of our OpenSimulator core
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project is provider of the best documentation for them. And I know currently we don't have enough documents for them, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if exists, it hasn't been maintenanced for years.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, who will be the &quot;Developers&quot;? It will be the contributors who contributes OpenSimulator framework itself. They
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should know OpenSim internal architectures, implementing guidelines, or licensing matters. Some experts can understand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them only by reading codes (yikes!), but it would be nice to have such documents, if we can keep updating them forever.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Possible Wiki Structure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Considering these points above, we can divide the wiki into three domains:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/">http://opensimulator.org/</A> &lt;-- for &quot;Client Users&quot; and &quot;Grid Users&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://framework.opensimulator.org/">http://framework.opensimulator.org/</A> &lt;-- for &quot;Framework Users&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://dev.opensimulator.org/">http://dev.opensimulator.org/</A> &lt;-- for the contributors of OpenSimulator core project (coders, document writers, issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> managers, wiki admins)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Although MediaWiki can create namespaces and we can use it for this purpose, I feel sub-domaining provides more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> straight-forward way to access to them (this is probably because I am an address bar lover). Again, this is just my idea.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Should we create anything on our own?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I personally think we don't need to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; to create all OpenSimulator documentation from the scratch,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there are already nice documents all around the web. Why not make great use of them? I don't mean we can copyright
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> violations and bring them all. Instead, it would be nice to have links to their project websites with simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> descriptions about their project goal or feature on our wiki pages. Or, using their documents with big credit would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nice too(Cons is duplicated documentation will be more difficult to maintenance).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder why kin projects (i.e. OSGrids, Inworlds, AuroraSim, &#8230;) are not feathered as kin developers. They are the good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator framework users and the good OpenSimulator &quot;User&quot; documents provider. And communities. I know there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many other OpenSimulator-forums and many experts grandly help so-called &quot;noobs&quot;. We can encourage and help them to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support others in their community, such as, again, adding link to their forums. Blogs too. I came here looking at a post
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in ilibsl blog. I had a parcel in Ener Sounds(<A HREF="http://iliveisl.com/makos-home/">http://iliveisl.com/makos-home/</A> is me), and after leaving there, I found
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator in another post and tried to use it (to reproduce the terrain of Ener Sounds in vain lol). That was the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start. OpenSimulator developers including me tends to detailed describe about the architectures, but for users, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documents created by the users will be helpful. It might be not the best way, since the users have to access each blogs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and forums to find the answer for their question, but if OpenSimulator core wiki has nice directory to find them easily,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it can be ideal. (I feel someone might have suggested the same before, but I can't remember who)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It shouldn't keep contributors from writing such documents in OpenSimulator Wiki. Our purpose are varies, so it should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be always open for those who wants to contribute the articles. But if we can create the scheme of &quot;Mash-up&quot; the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator-related documentations, OpenSimulator community (includes kin projects, blogs, forums or such) will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accurate toward mature community as a whole.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you for reading. *Steps down from soapbox*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, comments will be appreciated.
