<PRE>Sorry if I have posted again and again - I can't still see my post in my
mail client... I remember I have clicked &quot;sent&quot; at least ten times before I
received the mail from dahila.

&gt;<i>Which page(s) are you considering replacing? Or are you suggesting adding
</I>pages which define a user, in addition to the existing wiki pages which
describe OpenSimulator?

We are considering &quot;refactoring&quot; of wiki as a whole. Each contents won't be
changed for now, just  the moving of existing page would be the start point.
Old page will maybe redirected, if actually move on.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi, nice to meet you all. I'm Makopoppo.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In OpenSimulator Wiki, Fritigern told me his idea about dividing wiki into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user parts and developer parts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/User_talk:Makopoppo#An_Idea_Which_Has_Been_On_My_Mind_For_Some_Time">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/User_talk:Makopoppo#An_Idea_Which_Has_Been_On_My_Mind_For_Some_Time</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would be nice to implement it. And more, I'd like to hear your thought
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about wiki future as well, especially if you haven't use OpenSimulator wiki
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ever or recently. (This is rather my personal activity than as a wiki admin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> job)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is my idea about what OpenSimulator wiki will be:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * The definition of &quot;User&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator software, as itself, is a framework for 3D virtual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> environment. It can be included into enterprise systems; i.e. some might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to bundle it into their web servers, groupwares, or such. Some wants to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> create their own kins for their use. Some wants to simply use this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distribution out-of-the-box. Some doesn't want to own their sims, just wants
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to connect to them from their viewers. All of them are &quot;Users&quot;. They will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> categorized into three types:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Client Users: Who connects to (or logins to) OpenSimulator-based grids
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with their viewer, websites, or some other possible methods. They don't need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any computer-specific knowledges, they can be teenagers, or even infants.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Documentation for them might be out of focus of OpenSimulator project, it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather client vendor's area, but having minimal instruction and links to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their document for further information is not so bad idea.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Grid Users: Who connects their OpenSimulator-based regions to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator-based grids, or just using it standalone. They needs minimal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> knowledge of operation systems, databases, or some other related softwares
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such as web servers to run their own simulators. Since there are already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many resources for them, and especially for personal use, kins projects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing great job to make clear documents, maintain them and providing support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for years. We can encourage or help them to improve their documents, such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as, providing link list to their pages, or bollowing their article with huge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> credits.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Framework Users: Who enhances OpenSimulator software for their use. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> purpose varies amongst each other, from personal use to enterprise use. For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example, the person who implements *Module, script functions, connectors or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such. To say in another word, who using OpenSimulator as a framework. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> personally think that one of the role of our OpenSimulator core project is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provider of the best documentation for them. And I know currently we don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have enough documents for them, or if exists, it hasn't been maintenanced
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for years.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, who will be the &quot;Developers&quot;? It will be the contributors who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contributes OpenSimulator framework itself. They should know OpenSim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> internal architectures, implementing guidelines, or licensing matters. Some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experts can understand them only by reading codes (yikes!), but it would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nice to have such documents, if we can keep updating them forever.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Possible Wiki Structure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Considering these points above, we can divide the wiki into three domains:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/">http://opensimulator.org/</A> &lt;-- for &quot;Client Users&quot; and &quot;Grid Users&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://framework.opensimulator.org/">http://framework.opensimulator.org/</A> &lt;-- for &quot;Framework Users&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://dev.opensimulator.org/">http://dev.opensimulator.org/</A> &lt;-- for the contributors of OpenSimulator
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> core project (coders, document writers, issue managers, wiki admins)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Although MediaWiki can create namespaces and we can use it for this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> purpose, I feel sub-domaining provides more straight-forward way to access
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to them (this is probably because I am an address bar lover). Again, this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just my idea.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Should we create anything on our own?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I personally think we don't need to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; to create all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator documentation from the scratch, there are already nice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documents all around the web. Why not make great use of them? I don't mean
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we can copyright violations and bring them all. Instead, it would be nice to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have links to their project websites with simple descriptions about their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project goal or feature on our wiki pages. Or, using their documents with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> big credit would be nice too(Cons is duplicated documentation will be more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difficult to maintenance).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder why kin projects (i.e. OSGrids, Inworlds, AuroraSim, &#8230;) are not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feathered as kin developers. They are the good OpenSimulator framework users
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the good OpenSimulator &quot;User&quot; documents provider. And communities. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know there are many other OpenSimulator-forums and many experts grandly help
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so-called &quot;noobs&quot;. We can encourage and help them to support others in their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community, such as, again, adding link to their forums. Blogs too. I came
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> here looking at a post in ilibsl blog. I had a parcel in Ener Sounds(
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://iliveisl.com/makos-home/">http://iliveisl.com/makos-home/</A> is me), and after leaving there, I found
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator in another post and tried to use it (to reproduce the terrain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of Ener Sounds in vain lol). That was the start. OpenSimulator developers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> including me tends to detailed describe about the architectures, but for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> users, the documents created by the users will be helpful. It might be not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the best way, since the users have to access each blogs and forums to find
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the answer for their question, but if OpenSimulator core wiki has nice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directory to find them easily, it can be ideal. (I feel someone might have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggested the same before, but I can't remember who)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It shouldn't keep contributors from writing such documents in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator Wiki. Our purpose are varies, so it should be always open for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those who wants to contribute the articles. But if we can create the scheme
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of &quot;Mash-up&quot; the OpenSimulator-related documentations, OpenSimulator
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community (includes kin projects, blogs, forums or such) will accurate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> toward mature community as a whole.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you for reading. *Steps down from soapbox*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, comments will be appreciated.
