<PRE>As I see it thre are really TWO groups of &quot;users&quot; at present.

1) The &quot;client&quot; who &quot;only&quot; runs a viewer (e.g. Imprudence) and access
and established grid.

These &quot;users&quot;are not terribly sophisticated by most standards, but
everyone must start somewhere! This group has a uniques set of problems
at least in part to leaving the &quot;SL security blanket&quot;. Many very
productive members of our community are in this class (e.g Cyberlandia).

Setting up a new grid for a viewer does not seem terribly difficult to
those of us who get our hands dirty in the actual code, but it IS a
significant challenge to many!

2) The &quot;standalone grid operator&quot;. Thanks to Diva's incredible work with
wifi and D2 there is an ever increasing circle of these &quot;users&quot;.

They have their own PRIVATE playground and their own problems, in
addition it is a great way to learn about the &quot;guts&quot; of OpenSimulator!


Like Justin, I do not see a need for some massive realignment or rewrite
of the wiki (YET!!!), but these folks are getting to be a significant
&quot;minority&quot; of the group and once again have their own unique problems.

The MOST that I see as needed for the present is some sort of
specialized mail server (&quot;opensim-standalone&quot; or maybe &quot;opensim-DIVA&quot; -
in recognition of the work that she has done to make this happen!)

</I>&gt;<i> so.  Running OpenSim is always going to be a very technical task by most
</I>&gt;<i> people's standards.  It's an order of complexity more difficult than
</I>&gt;<i> running a webserver, for instance, and those aren't touched by everyday
</I>&gt;<i> users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that by far the better use of time is improving documentation. 
</I>&gt;<i> Although I've gradually [re]written quite a lot over the past year, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> sure there's still a lot which is incompletely, completely missing or
</I>&gt;<i> actively misleading (as you hint).  Unfortunately, the combination of
</I>&gt;<i> doc writing and technical chops is a rare one so I think this will only
</I>&gt;<i> slowly improve over time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Linking to other documents on the web is definitely encouraged.  But
</I>&gt;<i> this is an OpenSimulator wiki, so only topics that relate to
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSimulator are appropriate.  If someone wants to start a general wiki
</I>&gt;<i> then I think that would be better at a separate site.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/User_talk:Makopoppo#An_Idea_Which_Has_Been_On_My_Mind_For_Some_Time">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/User_talk:Makopoppo#An_Idea_Which_Has_Been_On_My_Mind_For_Some_Time</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would be nice to implement it. And more, I'd like to hear your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thought about wiki future as well, especially if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> haven't use OpenSimulator wiki ever or recently. (This is rather my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> personal activity than as a wiki admin job)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is my idea about what OpenSimulator wiki will be:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * The definition of &quot;User&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator software, as itself, is a framework for 3D virtual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> environment. It can be included into enterprise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems; i.e. some might want to bundle it into their web servers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> groupwares, or such. Some wants to create their own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kins for their use. Some wants to simply use this distribution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out-of-the-box. Some doesn't want to own their sims, just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wants to connect to them from their viewers. All of them are &quot;Users&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They will be categorized into three types:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Client Users: Who connects to (or logins to) OpenSimulator-based grids
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with their viewer, websites, or some other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible methods. They don't need any computer-specific knowledges,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they can be teenagers, or even infants.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Documentation for them might be out of focus of OpenSimulator project,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is rather client vendor's area, but having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minimal instruction and links to their document for further
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information is not so bad idea.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Grid Users: Who connects their OpenSimulator-based regions to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator-based grids, or just using it standalone.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They needs minimal knowledge of operation systems, databases, or some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other related softwares such as web servers to run
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their own simulators. Since there are already many resources for them,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and especially for personal use, kins projects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing great job to make clear documents, maintain them and providing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support for years. We can encourage or help them to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improve their documents, such as, providing link list to their pages,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or bollowing their article with huge credits.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Framework Users: Who enhances OpenSimulator software for their use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The purpose varies amongst each other, from personal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use to enterprise use. For example, the person who implements *Module,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script functions, connectors or such. To say in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another word, who using OpenSimulator as a framework. I personally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think that one of the role of our OpenSimulator core
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project is provider of the best documentation for them. And I know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currently we don't have enough documents for them, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if exists, it hasn't been maintenanced for years.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, who will be the &quot;Developers&quot;? It will be the contributors who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contributes OpenSimulator framework itself. They
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should know OpenSim internal architectures, implementing guidelines,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or licensing matters. Some experts can understand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them only by reading codes (yikes!), but it would be nice to have such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documents, if we can keep updating them forever.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Possible Wiki Structure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Considering these points above, we can divide the wiki into three
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> domains:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/">http://opensimulator.org/</A> &lt;-- for &quot;Client Users&quot; and &quot;Grid Users&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://framework.opensimulator.org/">http://framework.opensimulator.org/</A> &lt;-- for &quot;Framework Users&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://dev.opensimulator.org/">http://dev.opensimulator.org/</A> &lt;-- for the contributors of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator core project (coders, document writers, issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> managers, wiki admins)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Although MediaWiki can create namespaces and we can use it for this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> purpose, I feel sub-domaining provides more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> straight-forward way to access to them (this is probably because I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an address bar lover). Again, this is just my idea.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Should we create anything on our own?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I personally think we don't need to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; to create all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator documentation from the scratch,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there are already nice documents all around the web. Why not make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> great use of them? I don't mean we can copyright
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> violations and bring them all. Instead, it would be nice to have links
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to their project websites with simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> descriptions about their project goal or feature on our wiki pages.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or, using their documents with big credit would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nice too(Cons is duplicated documentation will be more difficult to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maintenance).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder why kin projects (i.e. OSGrids, Inworlds, AuroraSim, &#8230;) are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not feathered as kin developers. They are the good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator framework users and the good OpenSimulator &quot;User&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documents provider. And communities. I know there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many other OpenSimulator-forums and many experts grandly help
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so-called &quot;noobs&quot;. We can encourage and help them to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support others in their community, such as, again, adding link to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their forums. Blogs too. I came here looking at a post
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in ilibsl blog. I had a parcel in Ener
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sounds(<A HREF="http://iliveisl.com/makos-home/">http://iliveisl.com/makos-home/</A> is me), and after leaving
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there, I found
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator in another post and tried to use it (to reproduce the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> terrain of Ener Sounds in vain lol). That was the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start. OpenSimulator developers including me tends to detailed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> describe about the architectures, but for users, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documents created by the users will be helpful. It might be not the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> best way, since the users have to access each blogs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and forums to find the answer for their question, but if OpenSimulator
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> core wiki has nice directory to find them easily,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it can be ideal. (I feel someone might have suggested the same before,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I can't remember who)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It shouldn't keep contributors from writing such documents in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator Wiki. Our purpose are varies, so it should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be always open for those who wants to contribute the articles. But if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we can create the scheme of &quot;Mash-up&quot; the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator-related documentations, OpenSimulator community
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (includes kin projects, blogs, forums or such) will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accurate toward mature community as a whole.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you for reading. *Steps down from soapbox*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, comments will be appreciated.
