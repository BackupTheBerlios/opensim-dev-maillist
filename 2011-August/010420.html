A couple of issues are:
&quot;What if the company folds?&quot;, if you invest a lot of time and effort
into a project and the infrastructure you depend on disappears of the
face of the earth, how do you deal with that? How do you regroup the
community and re-establish a central point for information and distribution?

&quot;What if another company buys the infrastructure, or the company just
decides to make changes in policy?&quot;, Example: Recently, many gmail users
added a Google+ profile to the accounts they have been using for years,
only to get banned by Google for using a pseudonym for a name. So, being
a user of an external service leaves one vulnerable to the future
policies of the service and anyone using the service risks .

Keeping 100% control of the infrastructure allows continuity for the
community for the life of the project.

The Allura project recently caught my eye. It is the system used by
Sourceforge (<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/p/allura/wiki/Allura%20Wiki/">http://sourceforge.net/p/allura/wiki/Allura%20Wiki/</A>) and
they have shared their code under the Apache License 2.0. If we were to
make some drastic departure from what we do now into some integrated
system, something like that make sense. We could retain our control of
the infrastructure without having to develop all of it ourselves. We
could also house all the 3rd party components under the same system. Not
advocating any changes at this point. But, just window shopping.
