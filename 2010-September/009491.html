<PRE>Changed subject to reflect new topic, sorry for thread hijacking.  I should 
have started a new thread.

Spoofing can be prevented with signing.  People have been using public/private 
keys to digitally sign e-mail messages to authentication that the message was 
written by them and not changed/written by someone else.  If the original 
grid vanishes then all prims that where created on that grid will have the 
creator name marked with &quot;(unverified)&quot;.  Prims only need to be verified when 
they are being imported (either from an inventory/region archive or when 
rezed from a foreign user).  If the creator's public key is still available 
and the prim's signature is invalid, then the grid can either deny the import 
or clear the creator id.

</I>
Wasn't Hypergrid trying to make it easy for users from any grid to TP to any 
other grid (as long as both are Hypergrid enabled)?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; your request schema would not work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; First off, it overcomplicates (IMO) things if you even attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; show the current name of an identity. My plan has been to show the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; name AT CREATION TIME on a prim, e.g. the displyed creator name of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; prim will not change, even if the underlying identity changes their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; name. This removes much complaxity.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Second, your system breaks when a prim is taken to a new grid after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the grid it was created on has vanished from the internet. In that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; case, even the initial lookup will fail and you have no data to display.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If grids don't verify the Creator URL when receiving a prim from another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grid (not the original grid where it was created), then anyone can spoof
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the prim's creator to be any creator from any other grid.  A spoofer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would only have to create there own Hypergrid enabled region that they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control and make spoofed prims (with griefer content) then hypergrid to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another grid and rez a copy of the spoofed prim there.  Now they can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grief people on other grids and tarnish someone else's name.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hmm, there might still be a way to spoof the creator of a prim, even if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the &quot;Creator URL&quot; is validated with the grid that creator is from.  How
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would Hypergrid validate the original creator for a prim that comes from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some other grid?  Lets say a prim is created on grid ABC, then copied to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grid XYZ, then copied to grid Acme.  How would the last grid &quot;Acme&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; validate the prim's original creator?  It received the prim from a third
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; party grid, which might be run by a spoofer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One way to stop spoofing is to add a public/private key to the creators
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; profile (only the public key would be available to other grids) and have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all exported prims be signed with the creators private key.  Then any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grid receiving that prim could verify that the prim hasn't be modified
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using the creators public key (which would have to be requested from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Creator URL&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Therefore, I'd prefer to go with my initial recommendation and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; indeed store the URL, including the name, &quot;all over the place&quot;. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; client view can always decide to ignore that part and to a table
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; lookup, or even contact the grid of origin.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It seems that a lot of people here are all for omitting information
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that would be helpful for the 90% case in order to make their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; particular corner case the norm. 90% of avatars never change names.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can still get most of the speed-up you are looking for with a table
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that caches the URL -&gt; display name.  I am not trying to argue against
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; putting the display name in the URL, just against using it without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; verifying it.
