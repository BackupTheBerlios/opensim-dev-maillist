<PRE>VNC, in particular, has an alternative mode of operation that avoids the 
loopback issues altogether; maybe you were using that when you tested. 
More importantly, most client-server applications -- like VNC for 
example -- use only TCP connections. OpenSim uses both TCP and UDP.

Additionally, the Linden viewer receives capability URLs from the 
servers. These are opaque URLs generated from the configuration 
variables in the regions' ini file that must literally match certain 
comparisons that the viewer performs, and if those comparisons fail, the 
viewer refuses to connect.

UDP and capability URLs are the two things that make OpenSim networking 
more complicated than most C/S apps.

I'm yet to encounter a network that I can't configure to run OpenSim, 
but that is not to say that there aren't some out there, especially if 
the routers don't do good on UDP.

</I>&gt;<i> It seems opensim must be doing something more complicated than is

</I>&gt;<i> doesn't work for opensim.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have an explanation that would help me understand what the
