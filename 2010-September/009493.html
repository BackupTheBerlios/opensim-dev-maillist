<PRE>You are quite correct as far as your analysis goes, however what happens
when there are TWO very similar objects/textures/images/whatever?

You can certainly determine that &quot;A&quot; originated from &quot;X&quot; and &quot;B&quot; originated
from &quot;Y&quot;, bur there is simply NO way to determine which of the two is the
&quot;genuine original&quot; work.

As a retired IP lawyer I can cite endless case law which is directed at this
question and no one has yet found any &quot;bright line&quot; to determine this -
certainly not with the kind of certainty and clarity that would be required
to actually write code to make this determination!

&quot;A&quot; appears in 100M web site, and &quot;B&quot; only on 5 - does that make &quot;A&quot; the
&quot;genuine original&quot; somehow?

How about the 5 sites being from a history written 100 years ago? The
possibilities are endless.

Then lets talk about the concepts of &quot;fair use&quot; and &quot;scholars exemptions&quot;.

I use US law here because I am most familiar with US law, but please believe
that the situation in other countries is very similar because their concepts
of &quot;justice&quot; really boil down to being very similar. The methods and
expression are very different, but the underlying concepts are almost
universal.

</I>&gt;<i> when
</I>&gt;<i> they are being imported (either from an inventory/region archive or when
</I>&gt;<i> rezed from a foreign user).  If the creator's public key is still available

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; While you have a case with using a central table, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; storing the URL string, and therefore the name, all over the place,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; your request schema would not work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; First off, it overcomplicates (IMO) things if you even attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; show the current name of an identity. My plan has been to show the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; name AT CREATION TIME on a prim, e.g. the displyed creator name of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; prim will not change, even if the underlying identity changes their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; name. This removes much complaxity.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; Second, your system breaks when a prim is taken to a new grid after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; the grid it was created on has vanished from the internet. In that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; case, even the initial lookup will fail and you have no data to
</I>&gt;<i> display.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If grids don't verify the Creator URL when receiving a prim from
</I>&gt;<i> another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; grid (not the original grid where it was created), then anyone can
</I>&gt;<i> spoof
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the prim's creator to be any creator from any other grid.  A spoofer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would only have to create there own Hypergrid enabled region that they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; control and make spoofed prims (with griefer content) then hypergrid to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; another grid and rez a copy of the spoofed prim there.  Now they can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; grief people on other grids and tarnish someone else's name.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; hmm, there might still be a way to spoof the creator of a prim, even if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the &quot;Creator URL&quot; is validated with the grid that creator is from.  How
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would Hypergrid validate the original creator for a prim that comes
</I>&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; some other grid?  Lets say a prim is created on grid ABC, then copied
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; grid XYZ, then copied to grid Acme.  How would the last grid &quot;Acme&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; validate the prim's original creator?  It received the prim from a
</I>&gt;<i> third
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; party grid, which might be run by a spoofer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; One way to stop spoofing is to add a public/private key to the creators
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; profile (only the public key would be available to other grids) and
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; all exported prims be signed with the creators private key.  Then any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; grid receiving that prim could verify that the prim hasn't be modified
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; using the creators public key (which would have to be requested from
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;Creator URL&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; Therefore, I'd prefer to go with my initial recommendation and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; indeed store the URL, including the name, &quot;all over the place&quot;. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; client view can always decide to ignore that part and to a table
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; lookup, or even contact the grid of origin.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; It seems that a lot of people here are all for omitting information
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; that would be helpful for the 90% case in order to make their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; particular corner case the norm. 90% of avatars never change names.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You can still get most of the speed-up you are looking for with a table
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that caches the URL -&gt; display name.  I am not trying to argue against
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; putting the display name in the URL, just against using it without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; verifying it.
