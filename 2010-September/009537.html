&gt;<i> Hi Robert, 
</I>&gt;<i> Naali have mesh support now, not sure about OS
</I>
Naali viewer works using OS as server, with the ModRex module. Also the
old slviewer based realXtend viewer is there for those who need the
Linden features that Naali doesn't implement yet.

Naali (the new version of an Ogre based Opensim viewer) targets working
on all systems .. Runs even on the n900 Linux phone, on virtualpc with
mesa software gl (our buildslave runs tests after each commit in a
virtual machine) and on laptops with Intel drivers etc.

Perhaps Robert referred to the old rexviewer? It needs a good OpenGl
impl cause runs Slviewer gl for ui and ogre for the scene in the same gl
context. Doesn't work with Intel drivers, does with NVidia and ATI.
Naali draws everything with Ogre and works everywhere.

Sure it's great though that Linden is coming out with mesh support as
well. Reportedly OpenSim will support it pretty much as soon as the
viewer comes public. It's been prepared already and is quite a simple
addition on the server side. 

In RealXtend we've made other improvements in the meantime, like
importing full scenes from Blender/Max/Maya. The biggest thing that with
the new modular, customizable, extensible &amp; scriptable viewer Naali
+OpenSim is really becoming an application platform .. 'cause you can
make your own UI to your app and use the Entity-Component system to add
arbitrary data to the scene that you need for your functionality. Is
easy to make e.g. custom mouse hovering code that you handle in your own
client side script (Python or Javascript currently) etc. Improving this
is a main focus in our dev now and we'll be demoing and documenting it
more soon. The modularity and extensibility idea is similar to OpenSim
on the server side, so we hope this proves to be a good match for people
devving apps using OpenSim. For example we have client side GUI now for
managing scene imports that live on the server -- using that with OARs
might be nice too. Also with Naali there is no behind-closed-doors dev
with private alphas etc., but it's all out in the open for you to fork
on github and you can get commit rights similarily like to OpenSim etc.

But if you just want an application that is exactly like Second Life
(tm), does everything that it does, and doesn't need to do anything
more, at least currently using slviewer based things are for you.
Perhaps with the mesh support we can finally get compatibility so that
OpenSim scenes with meshes show both with slviewer and Naali. Possibly
helps that slviewer is LGPL now and people are ripping parts of it out
to small reusable modules .. perhaps we (or anyone) can add their mesh
code in a module to Naali at some point, so can show LLMeshes with Ogre
there.
