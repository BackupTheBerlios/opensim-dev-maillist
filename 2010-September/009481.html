I certainly agree that standards are hard work, which is why creating them without reference to any working examples 
seems an almost impossible task to me.  But that's just my own opinion which is not burdened by decades of experience :)

I also have to echo what Dahlia said earlier.  OGP was extremely limited, afaik being nothing beyond transporting an 
avatar name to a 'default' avatar on another grid.  There was no other identity or appearance preservation, let alone 
access to inventory - all extremely tough problems to address in any scalable or secure manner.

Dahlia's phrase &quot;OpenSim community&quot; rather than &quot;OpenSim team&quot; illuminates very well the structures in play here.  In 
terms of the core group, I wouldn't say that we were a team as such but more a community of people with a reasonably 
common set of interests who agree to abide by certain norms and a few rules.  There was never really an &quot;OpenSim team&quot; 
to respond to OGP proposals.  Rather, some people were interested in it and implemented the required bits and pieces and 
other people were ambivalent or more interested in alternative architectures.
