</I>I think that would be a great step forward for OpenSim.  Ideally you 
could segment HyperGrid to the side and implement any cross grid stuff 
externally.  IMO distributed grids will largely decompose to a set of 
distributed services and a web of trust across them that defines the 
model (completely open to walled garden).

More on OGP below.
&gt;<i> Like Diva, I also think that good standards very often only come out of working implementations.  Hence, though I've
</I>&gt;<i> been following the VWRAP lists (and OGP before that) I haven't been participating since there's been a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> hard-to-follow discussion without much real-world consequence.  And as a working developer I don't have the luxury of
</I>&gt;<i> sitting on my tush and contemplating the Platonic world of future standards all day ;) (joking).
</I>This is really the issue that has always bothered me.  There's been an 
assertion that working code was more important than &quot;standards&quot;.  Truth 
is, standards are hard work, its more fun to hack code.  And there *was* 
an existing implementation. LL and IBM demonstrated some limited cross 
grid functionality (hence the OGP work).  And asserting politics was an 
issue is just lame.  Linden Labs put forward a *working* system as a 
starting point along with some jointly developed code demonstrating 
limited interoperability. The code was even available to the OpenSim 
team.  So if there was a &quot;political agenda&quot; it was on both sides.  LL 
wanting to preserve some compatibility with their existing system (but 
willing to consider changes) and on the HyperGrid side a desire to 
explore and research ideas.

What still remains is the hard work of creating a standard that defines 
interoperability.  It would be great to see that progress, along with 
the code.
