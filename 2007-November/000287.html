Though, we won't figure out what is wrong if everyone hangs back at safe
versions.

</I>
I really think history has shown that merging + svn = more pain and
agony than anyone really can put up with.

&gt;<i> The situation we have now with the core devs (newbs and oldes)
</I>&gt;<i> tip-toeing around, being afraid to introduce bugs, because anybody
</I>&gt;<i> could be expected to pull trunk and run it is just absurd. Also, it

</I>&gt;<i> error' by committing - bughunting should be a community effort and
</I>&gt;<i> thus a community learning experience.
</I>
Keeping the quality of trunk high is more important on the development
front than the user front.  We've got 13 committers now, all working on
different schedules.  If someone breaks trunk in a bad way, the other 12
can't get things done.  Mistakes happen, but testing prior to commit
really needs to become part of our mantra if we're going to continue to
work as productively with so many developers. :)

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
