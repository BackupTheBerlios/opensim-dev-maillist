<PRE>Hi,

I have just started to look at OpenSim, and I'm especially interested in
scalability issues. In my preliminary tests the server is able to handle
up to 20-25 clients in a simple world using ODE physics, and I would
like to find ways of increasing this number to 100 clients or more. The
main limitation at the moment seems to be the CPU load of physics
calculations, but even with the basic physics there are limitations that
don't appear to be CPU related.

Before I start modifying the code I would like to know what has been
done and tried before, and I'm hoping that we can start a discussion on
what the present scalability bottle-necks are and ways to improve the
code.I have worked with parallel and distributed computing in other
applications, and I'm familiar with C#. My nickname on IRC is joha1.

/Johan
