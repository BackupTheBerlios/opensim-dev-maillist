<PRE>Hi Camilo,

The more hands the merrier, as long as there's someone who can speak 
english fairly fluently and if they can translate things like these 
mailing list messages the help would be very much appreciated.

If you guys need a hand with your proposal, give me a yell sometime 
before the 28th.

Regards,

Adam
