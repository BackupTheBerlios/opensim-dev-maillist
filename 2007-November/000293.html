<PRE>I think a lot of the newer SCMs handle three-way merging a lot cleaner 
than diff - although the newer versions of tortoisesvn seem to be 
getting much better at it - I've had few problems in the last few weeks 
other than the un-revert issue.

</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; changes and it was hard to make commits before it was all finished
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; and still leave trunk in a fully working (as much as it every does)
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; state. If we said trunk can be broke then he could have made those
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; commits.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Right, though in that interim the physics guys wouldn't have anything
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; they could test on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *sigh*
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Big is bad. Keep your changes small.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Commit often.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; I really strongly urge us to come up with a way of us being able to
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; not feel scared of making changes. Else I worry for the future. I am
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; very much in favour of Trunk being the place for active development,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; we just need to get people off the idea of updating to every new
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; version of it. And just release &quot;stable versions&quot; in some way
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; (tag/branch/ full binary release/whatever) every week or two (or
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; three).
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; One of the things that might help here would be to look into a
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; distributed source control system like mercurial. That would make it
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; very easy to have lots of parallel trees on OpenSim where people could
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; have all kinds of experimental things going on. It also allows for real
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; merging.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Distributed source control seems promising; anybody here has real 
</I>&gt;<i> experience in working on a 15-dev project with it?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> My immediate black hat reaction is that I don't buy the 'merging is 
</I>&gt;<i> easier' bit at all. Diff is still Diff. Also, I'd say that it even makes 
</I>&gt;<i> some merging scenarios even worse, with everybody having to create 
</I>&gt;<i> merges between their own set of patches, that then has to be 
</I>&gt;<i> re-re-merged into the official branch, but maybe it's just me not having 
</I>&gt;<i> any experience with it.
