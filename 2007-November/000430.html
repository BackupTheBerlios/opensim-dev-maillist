<PRE>My personal opinion on currency discussion at this point is that there is so
much more that needs to be addressed currency should even be a topic of
discussion, right OpenSim is barely 40% complete and there is a monumental
amount of work that needs to be done before implementing any kind of
currency, we could possibly be talking about a year or more before things
like this will be addressed, while its good to plan ahead i think this
discussion is quite a bit premature and so many things are going to change
by the time we can think about currency that at this point it really just
detracts from the core programming that needs to be completed.

&gt;<i>  I think the concern that Michael brings up is a little bit of a red

</I>&gt;<i> the validity of the currency in their implementation, then we should not
</I>&gt;<i> create software that will make it possible in any implementation.  That
</I>&gt;<i> sounds like a mistake to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me, the handling of ingrid currency is one of the more compelling
</I>&gt;<i> aspects of the Second Life and related experience.  It is worth noting that
</I>&gt;<i> many MMORPGs have different ways of supporting currencies, and from an
</I>&gt;<i> MMORPG perspective, it seems essential.  Likewise, from a business
</I>&gt;<i> perspective in seems essential.  I could easily foresee myself running a
</I>&gt;<i> very open grid where anyone could connect their regions and the currency in
</I>&gt;<i> that grid would be meaningless, while at the same time, running a much more
</I>&gt;<i> tightly controlled grid where I could verify the region operators and feel
</I>&gt;<i> confident that the money in that grid has real meaning.  It seems to me as
</I>&gt;<i> if currency should be grid dependent and not region dependent.  My
</I>&gt;<i> understand is that this is how the current SL viewers and SL servers behave,
</I>&gt;<i> and my hope is that OpenSim will end up being essentially an alternative
</I>&gt;<i> choice to the SL servers that behave essentially the same way and can
</I>&gt;<i> interact with the existing SL viewers without the need for special mods to
</I>&gt;<i> the viewers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I do hope that people rethink their view about currency and its role
</I>&gt;<i> in the OpenSim project.  I believe that not addressing it and making it an
</I>&gt;<i> important part of the project will make the project much less compelling.

</I>&gt;<i> One of the main problems with money in opensim, is the whole thing of
</I>&gt;<i> having the Region servers involved, in any way, in transactions. Which is
</I>&gt;<i> how the current system is set up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is okay, if you always know that you can trust a region server; ie
</I>&gt;<i> you have a closed grid where every region server on that grid is trusted.
</I>&gt;<i> This is how LL can use the current system. As they control the servers, they
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;know&quot;  how each region server will behave. But with a open grid where other
</I>&gt;<i> people can connect their region servers, then we can no longer trust a
</I>&gt;<i> region, like the current system expects. Anyone, could have changed some
</I>&gt;<i> code on their server to do fake transactions or various other things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the general opinion is that money should be something like a direct
</I>&gt;<i> client to transaction server approach, with messages saying the transaction
</I>&gt;<i> has been completed sent to the region server if required. And that will need
</I>&gt;<i> changes to the client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So at least at this point, currency is not part of the opensim project. I
</I>&gt;<i> generally, don't think it will ever really be part of the core, as different
</I>&gt;<i> uses could have their own requirements. And some uses, just won't require
</I>&gt;<i> any in-world currency. So its likely that such systems will be
</I>&gt;<i> add-ons/modules. But even for those its really to early.

</I>&gt;<i>    I do hope I'm not being dismissed as a 'marketing guy'.  I've been
</I>&gt;<i> trying to keep the discussion of how finances are handled in OpenSim on a
</I>&gt;<i> technical level.  I initially brought it up in terms of how we handle
</I>&gt;<i> authentication as a response to a suggestion of dealing with anonymous
</I>&gt;<i> users.  As we looked more closely at it, I tried to focus particularly on
</I>&gt;<i> how money is handle in scripts since that seems to be the real key do
</I>&gt;<i> commerce in Second Life and hence is likely to be key in OpenSim as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    When I connect to my OpenSim grid, I see that I have 1000 dollars.
</I>&gt;<i> I've looked at the database schema, and I don't see where that is stored.
</I>&gt;<i> It would seem as if it ought to be in the users table.  However, I don't
</I>&gt;<i> know enough about the entity relationships to know if it would be better off
</I>&gt;<i> in one of the other folders.  In addition, I'm not well enough acquainted
</I>&gt;<i> with the code, or the data abstraction layer at this point, to have a good
</I>&gt;<i> view of how to approach modifying the schema.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I also scanned through the code, but I couldn't find the section of
</I>&gt;<i> code where the number of dollars that a user has is communicated back and
</I>&gt;<i> forth between the server to the client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    All of that said, I think Ezekiel is right.  I've worked on too many
</I>&gt;<i> projects in the past were an important part of functionality is not
</I>&gt;<i> considered early on and it becomes a mess trying to shoehorn that
</I>&gt;<i> functionality in later.  In my mind, the currency component is one of those
</I>&gt;<i> pieces of functionality I would hate to see shoehorned in at the last
</I>&gt;<i> minute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    So, I do hope that we maintain a good threat about the currency and not
</I>&gt;<i> simply dismiss it because of potential non-technical issues.

</I>&gt;<i> Sean,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you are absolutely right. The technical discussion should not be drowned
</I>&gt;<i> by enhancement requests from the 'marketing guys'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, while you dev guys are working hard to get the core up to speed,
</I>&gt;<i> someone must plan ahead to add the features that make this whole venture a
</I>&gt;<i> success.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we discuss the money and usability stuff in a separate thread, how do
</I>&gt;<i> we make sure that we get heard and you don't end up with an excellent
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of an SL clone - minus the hipe ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ezekiel
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I think that in world Money is one of those places where the OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;grid runners are going to need to provide code appropriate to their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;situation.  Running a sim with no money is easy.  Money opens up all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;sorts of other non technical issues: privacy laws, taxes, refunds, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;It would be nice to avoid drowning out the technical conversation on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;list with lots of money pontificating.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;That being said, patches are always welcomed. :)
