Agreed, risk taking is very good.  I feel opposite on the grid front.
Pulling from SVN head means you are alpha or worse.  All the opensim
grids at this point should realize they are bug hunters attempting to
accelerate the project, and there are going to be bumps and bruises
along the way.

I do think the project has changed phases a bit, in the fact that there
are now enough developers that talking about a new major approach before
doing it leads to a lot of value, especially as most developers don't
have the whole project in their heads.  Something as tricky as new
interregion coms will benefit a lot from some discussion upfront,
especially in how it interacts with physics, scripting, etc.

&gt;<i>  By that I mean us programmers feel free do fix big things or make big
</I>&gt;<i>  restructoring changes when needed without thinking that they can't
</I>&gt;<i>  because it will take more than one commit and that means that its

</I>&gt;<i>  and still leave trunk in a fully working (as much as it every does)
</I>&gt;<i>  state. If we said trunk can be broke then he could have made those
</I>&gt;<i>  commits.
</I>
Right, though in that interim the physics guys wouldn't have anything
they could test on.

&gt;<i> I really strongly urge us to come up with a way of us being able to

</I>&gt;<i> very much in favour of Trunk being the place for active development,
</I>&gt;<i> we just need to get people off the idea of updating to every new
</I>&gt;<i> version of it. And just release &quot;stable versions&quot; in some way
</I>&gt;<i> (tag/branch/ full binary release/whatever) every week or two (or
</I>&gt;<i> three). 
</I>
One of the things that might help here would be to look into a
distributed source control system like mercurial.  That would make it
very easy to have lots of parallel trees on OpenSim where people could
have all kinds of experimental things going on.  It also allows for real
merging.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
