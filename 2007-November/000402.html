I'm not sure that this is going to help all that much, those packets
still need to get out.

If we only have 1 packet to send, why wouldn't we send it?  I think this
is going to make the situation worse.  Based on what I saw yesterday, I
think this would have made the situation fall down much worse.

&gt;<i> In theory this should help out a little during high transfer periods.

I think this is the wrong place to optimize right now.  What we really
need to do is to figure out how to send less packets.

Yesterday we had a nice test of the system.  Dual 3.6 Ghz box, 4 GB of
RAM.  With ODE enabled we were able to get about 20 AVs before it was
running &gt; 100% CPU.  (I'll have to figure out how many physical prims we
actually had there.)

Once we were at 130% utilization there was at least a 2 second lag in
movement updates, new users couldn't connect, and chat was laggy like it
does on the main grid.

If we are going after perf issues, let's not do subtle hackes on the
packet queue, but actually figure out where we don't really need packets
being generated in the first place.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
