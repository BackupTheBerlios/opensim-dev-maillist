That depens on if you are ok with it didn't conflict and something got
out that compiles, or you seen the need to understand the changes, what
they do, why thet do it that way and that the limitations of that
solution. In the end after a merge you have a diff, a change to
understand, if this are a big one it's much harder, this is the big
problem with all merging.

The braching and strategeies thet hg sais it offer is the same as we
always used on our projects. It might solve some of the techincal
problems with subversion, or clearcase, I'm however sure it doesn't
change the need to understand and to right whan mering the code.

With that I'll don't say that i'm not willing to try it, it sound like a
great tool, but it's not a like magic bullet.
