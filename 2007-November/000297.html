Yes, but the problem is made better in distributed SCM by understanding
the parent of change.

A ---*---&gt; B ------&gt; C ------&gt; D
     |
     +---&gt; E ------&gt; F

If I know that E is really a change from A instead of a change from D, I
can do a much better job on recognizing what I was fundamentally
changing, and have a better job resolving F &amp; D.  

Again, nothing complete solves 3 way merge, but you've got a 10x chance
of doing it right (with at least 10x less brain power expended) on an
SCM tool that actually understands how you got there, than one one that
assumes source code is a linear thing.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
