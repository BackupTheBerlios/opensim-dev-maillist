OpenSim is a pretty reasonably sized user of libsl.  I would just post
to the libsl list with a set of issues you've found with 0.3, and ask if
those things could be changed to get a 0.3.1 that will work with
OpenSim.  Especially if it is just visibility of attributes.  As long as
you act nice and polite, people are usually ammenable to being nice
back. :)

It would be nice to have a rev in tree that is a real libsl version, and
one that supports 64bit, and one that we can tell people which version
it is.  The current random pull from August has caused a lot of grief
for a lot of people.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
