<PRE>It seems like slurl is positioned to handle some of this.  Their format is
currently
<A HREF="http://slurl.com/secondlife/&lt;region">http://slurl.com/secondlife/&lt;region</A>&gt;/&lt;x-coordinate&gt;/&lt;y-coordinate&gt;/&lt;z-coordi
nate&gt;/

It seems as if they could easily replace 'secondlife' with the name of some
other grid.  It is also worth noting that current version of slurl and the
secondlife: protocol do not do anything to check which grid you are
connected to, so you can use within to teleport to places within any grid.

As to the ID/PWD, it seems as if the approach for other protocols would seem
appropriate for the osap (or whatever it gets called protocol)

<A HREF="osap://userid:password@host:port/sim/x/y/z">osap://userid:password@host:port/sim/x/y/z</A>

would seem to be the standard.  Omitting the userid and password would mean
either anonymous access, use the current access, or prompt for a userid and
password, which is how other protocols do it.  The optional port, would
behave similar to ports in other protocol definitions.  It would default to
the standard port for the protocol (80 for http, 8002 for osap), unless
overridden.

One of the issues, of course, would be to get various viewers, like the ones
produced by Linden Labs and Electric Sheep to accept and properly handle
these options.

The other issue that I'm particularly concerned about is the relationship
between authentication and 'money' in world.  The built in microcurrency, I
believe, is an important part of where an open second life needs to go.  Yet
this raises interesting questions about exchanging currency between worlds.
That is why the authentication, IMHO, is important, and reasons why looking
at currency and exchange rates between grids may be especially interesting.

  Some additional thoughts from a newbie on the &quot;Friendly Teleports&quot;
discussion you had back in September:

  For the OpenSims to be really open, the matter of adressing sims and
locations in sims will need to be given
  some additional thought. Since, as you state, OpenSim is intended to be an
open network (a web) of Sims rather
  than a closed world like SL, there definitely is the need for a common way
of addressing locations from outside
  - from the web or any other world that supports URL-type links.

  LL have a proprietary solution in addressing <A HREF="secondlife://sim/x/y/z.">secondlife://sim/x/y/z.</A> A
comparable open solution would be something like:
  <A HREF="osap://subdomain.domain.tld/sim/x/y/z">osap://subdomain.domain.tld/sim/x/y/z</A>   (osap is for Open Simulator Access
Protocol :)
  IMHO the current notion of users logging into grids with ID/PWD falls
short of the requirements of an open network.

  P.S: I would love to discuss design decisions that affect the usability
and hence success of OpenSim. What you build today
  could well be the 'next big thing' that mayaffect the online experience of
millions of people in the future.
