<PRE>Some things needed to be done with packet handling;
 
* The outbound UDP queue should be discarded immediately unless somebody can think of a really good and valid point why you'd want to send UDP packets in order (they will reach the client in a jumbled order anyway)
* We need to think hard about (discuss) whether update packes are supposed to be 'reliable' (acked) or not, and how that affect system design. ie, how acked packs could (or should) influence what is sent in the next packets.
* The severe rubberbanding issues implies that either the client is dumb (don't keep track of update sequence numbers per objects) or we're doing something wrong (ie updates are supposed to be reliable but aren't or vice versa) - I don't know which is the case.Regarding the update sweeps;
The current model is that we have a few timers causing objects to be scheduled for terse or verbose updates.
We then have a regular update sweep that runs over then, filters out the most pressing update needs (today based on how stale the change is) for each client (presence) then create packets for these updates and sends them.
 
I'd say the key here is to find a good (algorithmic) balance between load for updating (ie frames/sec) and number of update packets sent per client per second - how precise change should be simulated vs how precise it should be communicated. It seems prudent to separate these two, and the timer thresholds should be based on how fast change is simulated for the client(s) that has full interest in it.

Previously the&gt; environment had a 15% CPU usage baseline just handling the physical&gt; prims that were stopped. That is now removed, and I've actually got&gt; OpenSim running 0% in most cases, a couple percent if I walk around&gt; playing soccer with things, which all drops nicely back to 0% within 10s&gt; of not doing anything.&gt; &gt; -Sean&gt; &gt; -- &gt; __________________________________________________________________&gt; &gt; Sean Dague Mid-Hudson Valley&gt; sean at dague dot net Linux Users Group&gt; <A HREF="http://dague.net">http://dague.net</A> <A HREF="http://mhvlug.org">http://mhvlug.org</A>&gt; &gt; There is no silver bullet.
