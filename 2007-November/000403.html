<PRE>First off, to anyone randomly reading this, realize that OpenSim is in
very active development, so the below observations are point in time,
and probably won't be the case any more once you read this email.  If
you are reading this email more than 7 days after I posted it, it's
wrong, and doesn't hold any more.  (I can't make that clear enough, as I
don't want to see people arguing with me in 6 months saying that OpenSim
can only do X AVs &amp; Y Prims because of this email.)

That being said, I've got some interesting point in time information on
OpenSim based on an in Sim meeting that I hosted yesterday.

The environment:

 * svn head as of yesterday morning
 * standalone (but with 4x2 region grid, though most of the action
   happened in a single region)
 * mono 1.2.4
 * ubuntu 7.10 on a 2x3.6 Ghz P4 with 4 GB ram

In the environment we have:
 * ODE enabled for physics
 * ~ 200 prims
 
The prims in the environment are flags as follows:
count(*)|objectflags
159     |268632492
28      |268632493   &lt;-- Physical
9       |268633516   &lt;-- Phantom

After we got about ~20 Avatars on the region the environment was
completely pegged.  Those avatars were creating some content, though not
huge amounts.  

CPU for the process (via top) showed it to be at 140% (100% == all of
one CPU).  There were massive amounts of Sending Terse Update messages
on the console logs in a pretty continuous stream.  The environment grew
to about 1.5 GB of memory (though about 1/2 of that was swapped out,
presumably waiting for garbage collection, as I had plenty of ram free.)

Once we pegged, new users could no longer connect to the environment.
The event queues definitely were taking a pounding as well, as chat
messages took a solid 5 seconds or more to get get through.  People
could still walk and move, but it was quite laggy.  Even after the storm
died down new users couldn't get in.  I had to recycle the sim for new
connections to work.

That being said, the machine still had more to give.  Even at the worst
of it we were only at 60% user space utilization, 35% idle (neglible sys
/ wait, which is actually very good in some respects.  If we were using
sys and wait time, we'd have more issues to deal with).

Out of this I think we need to start to be mindful of a few things:

 * How brutal are we being on the network side of things?  I have a
   feeling we are being far to brutal.  I'm going to dig in soon
   (hopefully today) and figure out a way to get some stats out of there

 * We need to change the way Terse Updates out of the physics engine
   works.  (Teravus already committed code here, see the email is out of
   date already!)
 
 * Rethink leaning on C# events for physics, which was the prefered
   approach after this week's office hours.  The event infrastructure
   ends up degrading in funny ways once you peg a CPU, which is
   acceptable for things like Chat, but would be a disaster for physics.

Anyway, hopefully this is some good data to start pondering.  I'm hoping
by the next time I do one of these to have some more statistics
gathering built in so we can get more detail out of the environment to
see where we do naive things.

While this may seem a bit constrained right now, realize, that physics
only started working a week ago in any reliable sense.  I had folks in
world hanging out for 5 hours (1 hour of real peak usage), and the Sim
never went down.  It did stop accepting new users at one point, but no
crash, no exceptions of note on the command line.  We've come a long way
in the last 4 months. :)  I can't wait to see how much better we are in
4 months from now.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
