<PRE>When I first mentioned XMPP it was just a throw out idea. But thinking and looking into it some more I actually think its got some plus points. But I don't think we should think about it for Assets (which I think REST is the correct thing for) and maybe not even inventory. I was thinking more User server and grid server. 

I really don't think using REST because thats what LL use makes any difference as when they release specs we are going to have to have new implementation anyway. Please remember not everyone is interested in connecting to LL grid, so I think no matter what happens it most likely will be, that we end up with at least two implementations; our own and one compatible with their grid. 

I think XMPP most likely will end up as easiest and fastest to implement and it includes a number of things that we wouldn't need to spend time on. But when it comes down to it, I'm not fixed on the idea enough to fight strongly for it. So if the general opinion is for REST for all. Then I'd go with that without a problem. As long as we are going with it for the right reasons and not the compatible reason.

++++++++ (I think I've run out of pluses.)  Can't agree enough on this point.

&gt;<i> MW has suggested we look at using XMPP for this - from my cursory

</I>
After spending some time tracing on Tleiades AssetServer, based on REST,
REST has my vote.  The flexibility to get data in and our of the
environment is really nice.

The other nice things with REST is that HTTP load balancing techniques
are fairly well understood in the industry.  For instance, there are
even techniques and products for session aware HTTP spreaders.  It also
has the advantage of being similar to the aproach Zero has stated the
Linden grid is moving in, so future interop with the Linden grid will be
easier if our base services are REST.

That being said, I'd really like to see XMPP integration for IM if
possible, as it will make for easy bridging of in world presence to out
of world IM systems.

&gt;<i> The core grid functionality (what needs defining - this list will need 
</I>&gt;<i> to grow, currently just including things we use)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -- What needs defining --
</I>
I assume all the User &amp; Agent services are Region &lt;-&gt; Grid Server(s)?
Please correct me if I'm being dumb here.

&gt;<i> * User Services [grouped together]
</I>&gt;<i> ** Profile Retrieval
</I>&gt;<i> ** Instant Messaging   --&gt; Move to client?
</I>&gt;<i> ** Inventory Handling   --&gt; Move to client?
</I>&gt;<i>  * List Inventory  --&gt; Move to client?
</I>&gt;<i>  * Rez Inventory Item  --&gt; Move to client?
</I>
Can you define move to client? in this context?

&gt;<i> ** User Login to Grid
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Agent Services [grouped together]
</I>&gt;<i> ** Session Retrieval
</I>&gt;<i> ** Session Authentication
</I>
Both of those are Region &lt;-&gt; Agent Server for user info?

&gt;<i> ** Region Login from Grid
</I>
This is the circuit setup?

&gt;<i> * Region Services [grouped together]
</I>&gt;<i> ** Region Information Retrieval
</I>&gt;<i> ** World Map Services
</I>&gt;<i> ** ID/Position to URI translation
</I>
I'm not sure I fully understand what all the functions in each of these
are, can you explain a bit more?

This is a really great post, btw, in clarifying what it is that we need
to start defining.  Thanks for getting this out here Adam.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
