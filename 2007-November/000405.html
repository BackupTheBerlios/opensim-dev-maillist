<PRE>
in order to test some aggregate networking issues, we have a standalone
server (current trunk version from svn, no physics, xp, core duo, 4G,
...) where we are moving a bunch of objects around inside a fixed
region. each object is running a script with a timer event that fires
every 1-3 seconds and the object moves to a random position using
llsetpos (so there are no collisions). this set up gives us the ability
to generate scalable and almost reproducible loads (at least for object
updates).

with 30 objects in motion, the server runs &lt; 30% load, cyclical (athough
the peak loads occur at about 15 second intervals so i'm not sure how
that correlates to timer events). with 100 objects in motion the server
load peaks at around 75% (memory image is around 800M consistently).
however, with 100 objects in motion, the bandwidth to the one user
currently connected goes to (almost) 0, with periodic (every 10 seconds
or so) big bursts of updates.

Well, at least part of this note is out of date even as I wrote it, as
after this change there is a dramatic CPU improvement.  Previously the
environment had a 15% CPU usage baseline just handling the physical
prims that were stopped.  That is now removed, and I've actually got
OpenSim running 0% in most cases, a couple percent if I walk around
playing soccer with things, which all drops nicely back to 0% within 10s
of not doing anything.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
