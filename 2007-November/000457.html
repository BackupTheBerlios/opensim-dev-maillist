If you look back on the list a week or so you'll see some early results
that both Mic and I listed on our scalability findings so far.  We
seemed to hit different hot spots at the moment.

Real physics is always going to be high on the list of hot spots.  &quot;It's
hard and stuff.&quot;  One of the things that was previously talked about was
creating an OpenSim stress harness that would create lots of libsl bots
that would run around randomly.  That + profiler would help force out
more hot spots.

That being said, OpenSim code is still a long ways from feature
complete.  There are loads of packets not implemented yet, as well as
minimal scripting.  Be careful of premature optimizations at this point.

&gt;<i> Before I start modifying the code I would like to know what has been

</I>
I'm personally starting to look of the UDP in / out path in ClientView
and clean it up a bit, hopefully shaking out some perf gains in the
process by being smarter about what packets are sent / resent.  No idea
if that will have noticable overall effect (it should a little bit at
least), but the motivation is more from general cleanup.

Sticking profilers on the current stack (much easier to do in mono than
in .net) would be very helpful to start getting real data on where
hotspots are.  Please share those results on list, as I'm sure we'd all
find it useful.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
