<PRE>PS. 

I think most of us are kind of disregarding the current system/protocol as we know for most uses that its not really much use. But as you said it does have some uses, but if someone wanted to use such a system on their grid/game then it shouldn't take long at all to write a module that implements it. I think certainly within a few days a module could be wrote that handled most of the messages/transactions and kept track of users balance. Of course not everyone running a grid will be a programmer and every grid certainly shouldn't have to write their own version. But what I mean is that it should be very simple for someone to write a module and either submit it as a patch to the opensim project or to create their own project out of it. 

So I don't think, this is really part of what most of us mean, when we talk/think about a currency/payment system.

I hear what you're saying, but it still sounds an awful lot to me like your
saying that because we cannot force all servers to be trusted servers we
should not include in the design any feature that depends on trusted
servers.  That does not sound like a wise decision to me.

That said, I recognize there are many issues to be addressed in moving
forward from release 0.40, many of which, some people may find much more
important or compelling.  However, that doesn't mean we should design an
architecture that does not allow for the use of currency or discourage
people who are interested in that part of the project from working on it.

Nor does it suggest that we should attempt to be all things to all possible
users.  Of course we can't implement something that will meet all possible
needs of all the possible users.  However, to use that as an excuse to not
seek an architecture that will meet the needs of many people seems
particularly short sighted in my mind.  Yes, LL may be changing the way they
handle currency going forward.  Perhaps we need to be involved in that
discussion instead of just throwing up our hands and walking away.

Aldon,

Let me illustrate the core of the issue. You are logging in to your
bank. What happens, is that the access point where you are connected
currently, forces the decryption of the data, is able to see all the
contents cleartext, then reencrypts the data and sends it to the bank.
Same on the way back.

Assuming that the access point is something set up by &quot;someone on the
street&quot; - what would be the maximum amount of money you would make the
transactions for, in this scheme ? (ow, nevermind, your banking
details are already known to the access point, so they'll take care of
the remaining funds :)

And we're not even at this stage with opensim. :)

</I>&gt;<i> So, I do hope that people rethink their view about currency and its role

</I>&gt;<i> One of the main problems with money in opensim, is the whole thing of
</I>having
&gt;<i> the Region servers involved, in any way, in transactions. Which is how the
</I>&gt;<i> current system is set up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is okay, if you always know that you can trust a region server; ie
</I>you
&gt;<i> have a closed grid where every region server on that grid is trusted. This
</I>&gt;<i> is how LL can use the current system. As they control the servers, they
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;know&quot;  how each region server will behave. But with a open grid where
</I>other
&gt;<i> people can connect their region servers, then we can no longer trust a
</I>&gt;<i> region, like the current system expects. Anyone, could have changed some
</I>&gt;<i> code on their server to do fake transactions or various other things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the general opinion is that money should be something like a direct
</I>&gt;<i> client to transaction server approach, with messages saying the
</I>transaction
&gt;<i> has been completed sent to the region server if required. And that will
</I>need
&gt;<i> changes to the client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So at least at this point, currency is not part of the opensim project. I
</I>&gt;<i> generally, don't think it will ever really be part of the core, as
</I>different
&gt;<i> uses could have their own requirements. And some uses, just won't require
</I>&gt;<i> any in-world currency. So its likely that such systems will be
</I>&gt;<i> add-ons/modules. But even for those its really to early.

&gt;<i> to keep the discussion of how finances are handled in OpenSim on a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    When I connect to my OpenSim grid, I see that I have 1000 dollars.
</I>I've
&gt;<i> looked at the database schema, and I don't see where that is stored.  It
</I>&gt;<i> would seem as if it ought to be in the users table.  However, I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> enough about the entity relationships to know if it would be better off in

</I>with
&gt;<i> the code, or the data abstraction layer at this point, to have a good view
</I>&gt;<i> of how to approach modifying the schema.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I also scanned through the code, but I couldn't find the section of
</I>code
&gt;<i> where the number of dollars that a user has is communicated back and forth
</I>&gt;<i> between the server to the client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    All of that said, I think Ezekiel is right.  I've worked on too many

</I>those
&gt;<i> pieces of functionality I would hate to see shoehorned in at the last
</I>&gt;<i> minute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    So, I do hope that we maintain a good threat about the currency and not
</I>&gt;<i> simply dismiss it because of potential non-technical issues.
