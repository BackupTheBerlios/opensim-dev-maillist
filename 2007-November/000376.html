<PRE>A few months ago we did a lot of talking (both on the mailing list and irc) about what we would need for a new physics plugin interface system. And the general agreement (if I remember correctly) was for a event based system, so like your option 1. I'd have to dig back through the old emails to remember what else we spoke about and/or decided. 

Teravus Ovares &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">teravus at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote: With the addition of physical prim, we're starting to notice the limitations of the existing physics plugin framework.
  
 This is a call to discussion on how to expand the framework to fit our current needs and our upcoming needs.  Here's an incomplete list of the needs that our framework isn't filling currently(add as necessary): 
  
 1. Differentiation in reporting ground collision vs collision with another PhysicsActor (needed for scripting &amp; some updates on the region/region module code)
 2. A way to increase the amount of terse updates when a prim is in motion (needed for making physical prim move smoothly).
 3. A way to get/calculate the velocity of the prim that someone has grabbed (dragged mouse on, not selected in Edit tools [the two methods of moving prim are different and have two different routines already, but the information never gets down to the physics engine.]) and ungrabbed. (needed to be able to 'throw' a physical prim by grabbing it) 
  
 Two of the possible ways that it can be done..     
  
 1. (Physics Oriented - Where the Scene actively gets updates from the physics engine) Set up physics events that get raised (With this method, we also need a physics event subscripion manager..  so the number of events raised is only what is required to make the system work..   and the massive amount of events that are raised by the physics engines don't bring the whole system down.) 
  
 2. (Scene Oriented - Where the scene can peek into the physics scene when it wants) Do basic retrofactoring to:
  2a. Include 1..   (IsCollding would be changed to - CollidingObject and CollidingGround, and they would be changed to int number of collisions)
  2b. Figure out a way to provide an interface for a PhysicsActor to request an immediate terse update
  2c. Figure out a way to get the velocity of the grab instead of just calling the 'Position' method in the physics engine.   Might need a 'grab parameters' or make use of the 'Velocity' property. 
  
 Lets work together on figuring out how to expand the system so that all current and (foreseeable) future needs are met :D
  
 Best Regard
