I disagree on just punting on the upgrade.  The amount of pain is causes
folks on IRC in 64bit land, and the number of folks we are loosing as
being interested in the project because of it is quite high.

Per previous email, if we've got issues with the library, especially
just attribute visibility, those should be communicated to the sldev
team and see if they would be nice and address them.  Tleiades, a
complete list of your findings would be great.

&gt;<i> This does raise a interesting topic though - I think Sean volunteered to

You'll have to be a bit more specific.  :)  I did tell MW it's been a
while since I did UDP packet handling.  What specifically do you want
digging into?

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
