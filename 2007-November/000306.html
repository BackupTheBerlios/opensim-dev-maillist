<PRE>Yeah finding c# jabber/xmpp servers is a problem. There is one (that doesn't look that complete) but its in c#' 3.0 so not really usable by us at the moment. There are some c# xmpp client libraries (not completely sure the licenses) so I guess its most likely a case of writing our own servers from them. Or taking a java server and porting, which maybe the easiest thing.

But, I think after reading mic's reply that we should drop the idea of using XMPP for grid/user, as I think we need to listen to someone who has had experience of using it. So we should just use it for IM's , as has been the plan since very early in this project.

My brain is starting to wrap on this a bit more, and treating Regions
and Users as just things with presence via XMPP actually seems pretty
interesting.

Could you sketch out a bit more the way you think that would work?

Agreed, and understood.

&gt;<i> I think XMPP most likely will end up as easiest and fastest to

</I>&gt;<i> going with it for the right reasons and not the compatible reason.
</I>
Presumably, regardless of how much XMPP will be in OpenSim (i.e. just
messaging or messaging + much more) we'll need XMPP client / server
classes in OpenSim anyway.  So work in getting that into tree and
functional would be good regardless.

Fwiw, XMPP did come up at last office hours re: IM, and steffan said
something about there not being nicely licensed library/server for C#.
It would be good to make sure we had that before getting on the XMPP
bandwagon.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
