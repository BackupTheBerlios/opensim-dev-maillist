&quot;home sim&quot; shows the message to the user before teleporting to the
remote grid. I have such a capability in the architecture that I was
hacking on this weekend (the mail did not seem to get through to the
list, but it's on my blog anyway :)

</I>
there's a way to do that with the add-on small application, and not
change the client. how - simple:

when you make a payment above, say, 100L, or above a certain rate, the
payment server sends a random string to the client via IM. They have a
small &quot;pad&quot; program where they enter this challenge, and the amount of
the transaction. it outputs the response. user IMs this response.
Payment server generates the challenges randomly, so the malicious sim
is not able to predict this - so even if they spoof this to the
client, they do not really gain anything. Very very draft, but might
be something around that.

Basically it is the same problem as fighting phishing, except with a
slightly different twist.

+ need the trust models for the &quot;foreign agent&quot; and the &quot;some sim on
this or another grid&quot;.
