My personal experience has been with ~ 5 active trees on a source base
(changes coming in daily off those).  It take a little getting used to
such a model, but I think it may help.

is the best explaination I've seen out there on the whole model.  They
do use mercurial for their example.

The Linux kernel works on git (it and mercurial are roughly the same
functionally, but mercurial has an easier interface), there are at least
30 active trees being merged on a regular basis.  You can hear it from
the horses mouth here: <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8</A>

I used to think this as well.  Then I started using hg a lot, and
realized that I actually had a chance of merging correctly with hg
(mercurial).  More importantly, you get to try the merge in your tree

3 way merge has come a long way, it is really better in a distributed
svn environment.

None of those are distributed environments. :)  Distributed SCM is a
relatively new idea that came out of building a tool that actually works
for Linux Kernel development (lots of distributed developers).  Bit
Keeper is the only proprietary offering in this space.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
