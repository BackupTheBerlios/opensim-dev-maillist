<PRE>Hi

I am trying to do the changes required in opensim in order to be
compatible with libsl 0.3.

One of the nastier changes they have done is that &quot;TickCount&quot; in the
Packet class is marked &quot;internal&quot;, which means that opensim cannot
reference that property. TickCount is used in
ClientView.PacketQueue.cs to help manage packet acks.

&lt;philosophy&gt;
I think the basic problem stems from the fact that the primary
thinking in the libsl team is &quot;replacement viewer&quot; which means that
packets and comms are focused on the client side, and opensim is
thinking &quot;replacement grid/region&quot;, which means that packets and comms
are focused on the server side.
&lt;/philosophy&gt;

The short story is, what should/could have been a simple exercise,
suddenly has turned nasty, I see to ways forward:
1) change libsl, and talk with the libsl team to *not&quot; mark TickCount
as internal,
2) change opensim, this will require a change in the packet shipping
code of OS, which will take some time - at least for me - since I am
not familiar with that part of os.

suggestions on how to progress, are welcome.
