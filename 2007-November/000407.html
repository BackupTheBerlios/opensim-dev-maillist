<PRE>i played with this some this afternoon (ode physics). i have about
50-100 pyramids that i loft up to a height of about 10m above a mountain
and let them drop (and repeat 1000 times). the load was never a problem
(at 50 the average CPU utilization is less than 50%). however... before
the iterations complete, the physics fails on each of the individual
objects (they get lofted but never fall) and the server throws an
exception in ODE (OdePlugin.cs line 533)... 

on a different note... i played around with different ways of writing
the script. without digging into the code too far, the issue with the
performance earlier certainly seemed to be related to handling of timer
events. 100 timers firing once a second or once every other second with
no physics causes *far* more load (and other bad behavior like dropping
updates) than handling the physics on 100+ objects rolling down a
mountain.

I would suggest enabling ODE.  I think that the days of basic physics
being interesting are coming to an end now that we've got a physics
engine that works reasonably well.

It would also be interesting to see what the difference in load was
between it an basic physics.  I'm assuming 10x, but a real number there
would be good to have.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
