My brain is starting to wrap on this a bit more, and treating Regions
and Users as just things with presence via XMPP actually seems pretty
interesting.

Could you sketch out a bit more the way you think that would work?

Agreed, and understood.

&gt;<i> I think XMPP most likely will end up as easiest and fastest to

</I>
Presumably, regardless of how much XMPP will be in OpenSim (i.e. just
messaging or messaging + much more) we'll need XMPP client / server
classes in OpenSim anyway.  So work in getting that into tree and
functional would be good regardless.

Fwiw, XMPP did come up at last office hours re: IM, and steffan said
something about there not being nicely licensed library/server for C#.
It would be good to make sure we had that before getting on the XMPP
bandwagon.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
