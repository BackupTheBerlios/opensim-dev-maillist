<PRE>Hello gentlemen are as
I apologize because it dominates the English, my name is Latin American
camilo I recently met the project OpenSim and my university project talk
about comrades they are willing to collaborate, you talk about the project
rector of the university and is very interested but I have to show analysis
of the draft so that they can adopt it decided to start reading the source
code means because I have knowledge of c #. net but I lost a lot not find a
guide clearly saw that in the wiki there is a segment devoted to
documentation, but unfortunately for this in my English, I am writing in a
first step to sending you my situation and secondly to ask if you have the
class diagrams of the project in original format and other documentation
that I can serve to start the analysis of the project.

Should they approve the project seramos 5 people dedicated full-time to
assist the development of the project but not master the English so we
thought was to create wiki project in Spanish I would like to know your
opinion.

We want to hear from you a little know how it began the project who is the
leader and how they have managed to work as a team.

I like to describe my profile

My full name is Camilo Galeano, study and analysis systems development, I
like project management software (analysis and design) are basic modeling in
Blender 3D use GNU / Linux and I have a great inclination by free software
projects.

Well that's all for now

Sincerely ...
I hope his comments

My user name in the Wiki is demetrius
