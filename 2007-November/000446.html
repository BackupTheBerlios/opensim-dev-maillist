&gt;<i> &gt; I am advocating we should change the design of the feature such that

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, these are the sort of considerations that I think we should be

</I>
perfect, we're in full sync then! :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the user identity and the interdomain (or intersim
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; within single grid) trust model are the foundations which we do not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have at the moment - and I believe they are critical to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand on how to tackle micropayments in any meaningful way :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this gets to some of the crux of the issue.  Identity and
</I>&gt;<i> interdomain
</I>&gt;<i> or intersim trust models seems like it should be a core issue that
</I>&gt;<i> people focus on, independent of the peculiarities of micropayments,
</I>&gt;<i> and it was this context that started the whole discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yup. We're in violent agreement :). I started musing around with the
IDTP precisely because it allows to toy around with the trust models
and distributed identity, and associated protocols.

take a look at <A HREF="http://daltonic.blogspot.com/2007/11/interdomain-teleports-revised.html">http://daltonic.blogspot.com/2007/11/interdomain-teleports-revised.html</A>
(cos I am not sure whether my hyperlong mail to the list with the
similar contents got through) - that post basically is my mail to the
list minus the few-thousand-lines-diff of hackishly done code to make
it work.

&gt;<i> &gt; Claiming the existence of the micropayments system is a huge liability
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the PR standpoint for the project - even if we consider the &quot;toy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tokens&quot; to be nonexchangeable into any real money. Once there's any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; touch with the real money, additionally there're legal legislation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rules that kick into place - I guess this is one of the reasons why
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there's no rush in this direction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I've repeatedly noted, I'm more interested in the architectural
</I>&gt;<i> issues than I am in the PR or legal issues.  I thought that was
</I>&gt;<i> what the list was trying to focus on.
</I>
yes, technical issues of course are the primary concern.

But when we start talking even about toy money, it starts smelling all
other kinds of protocols, so even though IANAL, I prefer to try to
keep those in mind according to my modest capacities :)

There's actually a lot of area for experiment there.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In any case - I totally agree that just merely implementing a plugin
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doing a simple database backend doing the L$ arithmetics + packet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handling code as a sort of module is a useful thing, and is very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; welcomed - it would be a very good start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I get some free time, I will explore this.  Looking at the wiki
</I>&gt;<i> for comments about modules, all I see is about adding Region modules.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure that this fits as a region module, so thoughts about
</I>&gt;<i> how to add this as a user or communication module would be appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise, I'm curious about how the client receives information about
</I>&gt;<i> how many dollars an avatar has.  Any ideas in tackling that, as well
</I>&gt;<i> as writing a module that is consistent with any data abstraction layer
</I>&gt;<i> would be appreciated.
</I>
I *think* you might want to search for SendMoneyBalance / AddMoney
functions (but this is purely on the quick glance into the code, I
never looked at this, so take it with a grain of salt! :-)
