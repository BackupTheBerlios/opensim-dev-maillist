I think that in world Money is one of those places where the OpenSim
grid runners are going to need to provide code appropriate to their
situation.  Running a sim with no money is easy.  Money opens up all
sorts of other non technical issues: privacy laws, taxes, refunds, etc.

It would be nice to avoid drowning out the technical conversation on
list with lots of money pontificating.

That being said, patches are always welcomed. :)

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
