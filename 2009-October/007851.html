i think honesty can be a facilitated by a discussion remaining confidential.

i can see that point, but i can also see the points made by adam respectively
the points made in the F/OSS guidebook --- in balance (my personal one) i'd
rather have core committers discuss whether i should have voting rights in private.

no, you are right on that one. it's a discussion about our understanding of
licensing issues and whether there is indeed an issue here or not.


re compartmentalized: they are, at least we try very hard to.
