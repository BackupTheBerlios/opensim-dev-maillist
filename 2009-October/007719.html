<PRE>Right, but any decent framework/platform that has any expectation of being used designs in the open and publishes a roadmap for the changes planned so that people that do wish to productize around it can plan and do so without huge hassles.  They don't just throw shit up on a wall and see what sticks nor do they hack away on the head of the development tree without a pre-existing design and/or documentation, destabilizing what's there for everyone else. 

The user community for OpenSim has been pretty patient and having a dedicated community of grid operators (all of whom are consuming the &quot;platform&quot; in the form of a product albeit rough around the edges). 

I heard Mike making an appeal for effort around capturing the innovation that's done around the edges of the framework.  IMO that's in part hoping that OpenSim will &quot;grow up&quot; and cease being mostly a hackers playground but rather really become the platform you say it is.  But to do so IMO requires a tad more rigor than shown in the project to date.

Mike

Holdit!

OpenSim is NOT A PRODUCT. OpenSim is a BASE other people can make a 
product out of. So, OpenSim aims to include as little as possible, 
distros are the ones who will put it together and relicense it as 
they see fit.

OpenSim Core is not a maker of distros. We are not a product 
company. We are a loose association of people who share an interest. 
We don't _want_ to make a &quot;product&quot;, because we can't support a 
product. We make &quot;bits and pieces&quot; and let those with support staff 
handle productizing it.
