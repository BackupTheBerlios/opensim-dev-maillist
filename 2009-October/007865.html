<PRE>Strongly agree with your analysis Morgaine. Right on target.

&gt;<i> Greetings.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Three points of fact:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      1. Opensim is now in Git, a distributed SCM that promotes
</I>&gt;<i>         distributed development. 
</I>&gt;<i>      2. Opensim devs have declared many times that Opensim is not a
</I>&gt;<i>         product, but a platform or toolkit from which products can be
</I>&gt;<i>         made. 
</I>&gt;<i>      3. Opensim distros have started to appear (Diva++), consistent
</I>&gt;<i>         with point #2. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These 3 points taken together suggest the following rather likely
</I>&gt;<i> course of future history:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       * Git will be used in the manner in which it was intended.  In
</I>&gt;<i>         other words, there will be an explosion of Git community repos
</I>&gt;<i>         featuring personal branches created by Opensim user/developers
</I>&gt;<i>         outside of the core group, in much the way that happened with
</I>&gt;<i>         the LL viewer.  It's likely to happen even more strongly in
</I>&gt;<i>         the case of Opensim, because Git promotes this and because
</I>&gt;<i>         Opensim code is already nicely modular, which cannot be said
</I>&gt;<i>         of the LL viewer. 
</I>&gt;<i>       * As happened with community viewers, many Git community repos
</I>&gt;<i>         will gain high reputations for new features, better
</I>&gt;<i>         performance, more robustness, expanded data types, higher
</I>&gt;<i>         scalability, fewer barriers to open teamwork, alternative
</I>&gt;<i>         interop models, better APIs, and a hundred other things that
</I>&gt;<i>         an extended community can tackle but which the small core team
</I>&gt;<i>         has never thought of, or not had the manpower to pursue. 
</I>&gt;<i>       * Opensim distro builders will build their distros from all the
</I>&gt;<i>         best features available in all the best known and most
</I>&gt;<i>         respected Git repos, cherry picking to make their distros
</I>&gt;<i>         special in whatever way suits them.  Distro builders will of
</I>&gt;<i>         course also provide their own Git repositories, swelling the
</I>&gt;<i>         repo numbers even further and giving them the prestige of a
</I>&gt;<i>         good distro name.  The Opensim equivalents of RedHat and
</I>&gt;<i>         Ubuntu will emerge, both as distros and as companies, and will
</I>&gt;<i>         become formidable. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The above doesn't require much vision because it's almost certain to
</I>&gt;<i> happen, simply because the tools are right, the incentives exist,
</I>&gt;<i> people like doing their own thing, and the precedent offered by the
</I>&gt;<i> community viewers is very strong.  The only big uncertainty is to what
</I>&gt;<i> extent it will happen, and how much control the core group will retain
</I>&gt;<i> amid the plethora of distributed repositories.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The latter is very hard to predict.  However, two extreme cases might
</I>&gt;<i> give some idea of how things might pan out:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       * If the core group remains closed, secretive and exclusionary,
</I>&gt;<i>         this promotes the emergence of more respected upstream
</I>&gt;<i>         alternative repos as replacement Opensim Git masters.  If
</I>&gt;<i>         disputes like the current one get really bad, there will be
</I>&gt;<i>         wholesale forks of core, destructive competition, politically
</I>&gt;<i>         driven non-sharing, and very damaging press and public
</I>&gt;<i>         perception. 
</I>&gt;<i>       * If the core group becomes open and transparent, and embraces
</I>&gt;<i>         distributed community development for core features, this
</I>&gt;<i>         promotes the role of the core repo as the single (or at least
</I>&gt;<i>         the leading) upstream master, a respected concentrator of the
</I>&gt;<i>         best features from broad Opensim community development. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a strong predisposition for openness so please take this advice
</I>&gt;<i> with a pinch of salt, but I believe it's correct nevertheless.  If the
</I>&gt;<i> current core group wishes all the accolades and respect that come from
</I>&gt;<i> a highly popular and well run community open source project, I believe
</I>&gt;<i> that the right course of action is to become organizationally open and
</I>&gt;<i> transparent as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps reaching version 1.0 and creating an open foundation might be
</I>&gt;<i> a good time for that to happen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards, and much admiration for the great achievements so far. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Morgaine.
