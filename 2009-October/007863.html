<PRE>Very well played Morgaine :)
Cheers!

&gt;<i> Greetings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Three points of fact:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Opensim is now in Git, a *distributed* SCM that promotes *
</I>&gt;<i>    distributed* development.
</I>&gt;<i>    2. Opensim devs have declared many times that Opensim is not a product,
</I>&gt;<i>    but a platform or toolkit from which products can be made.
</I>&gt;<i>    3. Opensim distros have started to appear (Diva++), consistent with
</I>&gt;<i>    point #2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These 3 points taken together suggest the following rather likely course of
</I>&gt;<i> future history:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Git will be used in the manner in which it was intended.  In other
</I>&gt;<i>    words, there will be an explosion of Git community repos featuring personal
</I>&gt;<i>    branches created by Opensim user/developers outside of the core group, in
</I>&gt;<i>    much the way that happened with the LL viewer.  It's likely to happen even
</I>&gt;<i>    more strongly in the case of Opensim, because Git promotes this and because
</I>&gt;<i>    Opensim code is already nicely modular, which cannot be said of the LL
</I>&gt;<i>    viewer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - As happened with community viewers, many Git community repos will
</I>&gt;<i>    gain high reputations for new features, better performance, more robustness,
</I>&gt;<i>    expanded data types, higher scalability, fewer barriers to open teamwork,
</I>&gt;<i>    alternative interop models, better APIs, and a hundred other things that an
</I>&gt;<i>    extended community can tackle but which the small core team has never
</I>&gt;<i>    thought of, or not had the manpower to pursue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Opensim distro builders will build their distros from all the best
</I>&gt;<i>    features available in all the best known and most respected Git repos,
</I>&gt;<i>    cherry picking to make their distros special in whatever way suits them.
</I>&gt;<i>    Distro builders will of course also provide their own Git repositories,
</I>&gt;<i>    swelling the repo numbers even further and giving them the prestige of a
</I>&gt;<i>    good distro name.  The Opensim equivalents of RedHat and Ubuntu will emerge,
</I>&gt;<i>    both as distros and as companies, and will become formidable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above doesn't require much vision because it's almost certain to
</I>&gt;<i> happen, simply because the tools are right, the incentives exist, people
</I>&gt;<i> like doing their own thing, and the precedent offered by the community
</I>&gt;<i> viewers is very strong.  The only big uncertainty is to what extent it will
</I>&gt;<i> happen, and how much control the core group will retain amid the plethora of
</I>&gt;<i> distributed repositories.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The latter is very hard to predict.  However, two extreme cases might give
</I>&gt;<i> some idea of how things might pan out:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - If the core group remains closed, secretive and exclusionary, this
</I>&gt;<i>    promotes the emergence of more respected upstream alternative repos as
</I>&gt;<i>    replacement Opensim Git masters.  If disputes like the current one get
</I>&gt;<i>    really bad, there will be wholesale forks of core, destructive competition,
</I>&gt;<i>    politically driven non-sharing, and very damaging press and public
</I>&gt;<i>    perception.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - If the core group becomes open and transparent, and embraces
</I>&gt;<i>    distributed community development for core features, this promotes the role
</I>&gt;<i>    of the core repo as the single (or at least the leading) upstream master, a
</I>&gt;<i>    respected concentrator of the best features from broad Opensim community
</I>&gt;<i>    development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a strong predisposition for openness so please take this advice with
</I>&gt;<i> a pinch of salt, but I believe it's correct nevertheless.  If the current
</I>&gt;<i> core group wishes all the accolades and respect that come from a highly
</I>&gt;<i> popular and well run community open source project, I believe that the right
</I>&gt;<i> course of action is to become *organizationally* open and transparent as
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps reaching version 1.0 and creating an open foundation might be a
</I>&gt;<i> good time for that to happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards, and much admiration for the great achievements so far. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Morgaine.
