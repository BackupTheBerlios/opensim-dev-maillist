<PRE>Dahlia's suggestion about making the prims phantom during rezzing was 
helpful, but didn't fix my problems completely.

It looks like there are several problems that are converging to create a 
perfect storm.

1) Something about script execution or creation is slower in 0.6.6.  I 
can't put my finger on it, but I definitely see a significant difference.

2) I'm not sure if this is a new problem or if it is simply being made 
visible by Problem 1, but I'm seeing scripts spontaneously stop 
executing in 0.6.6.  For example, I have one script that makes a call to 
llSleep.  Before it sleeps, it prints the number of seconds that it will 
sleep and then when it comes back from sleep, it prints &quot;I'm back&quot;.  I 
have clearly seen that, in some cases, it never comes back.  I don't 
know if the script terminates or is dropped from the queue or what.  It 
just never executes after that.  The problem isn't unique to llSleep.  I 
suspect that several unexplained occurrences are due to something like this.

3) There is a problem in which scripts that kill themselves are not 
removed from Active Scripts 
(<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=2929">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=2929</A>).  I know that this 
happens in 0.6.5 and 0.6.6.  I think it happens in 0.6.7, but I've been 
doing so much testing that I can't remember if I specifically confirmed 
that or not.

4) 0.6.7 imposed a very restrictive limit on the distance that an LSL 
script can move a child prim. 
(<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=4228">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=4228</A>).  OpenSim is 
basically unusable for my LSL rezzer until this is relaxed.

Anyway, those are the issues that I am currently aware of.  As I develop 
repros for these and other issues, I will post them to Mantis.

I'm on vacation next week, so I won't be working on this until the 
following week.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     One part of Prim Composer is an LSL-based rezzing system that

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://liferain.com/downloads/primcomposer/">http://liferain.com/downloads/primcomposer/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     In OpenSim 0.6.5, this system worked almost as good as in Second Life.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Unfortunately, it does not work well in 0.6.6 and is unusable in 0.6.7
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     *Test Platform*: Standalone, Windows XP, MySQL, ODE Physics,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Meshmerizer.  Other than this I use the defaults.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     So, the question is &quot;What is causing the problem?&quot;  What has changed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     since 0.6.5 that causes the LSL rezzer to perform so badly?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I have verified that the script engine defaults have not changed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     *How the rezzer works*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The rezzer contains linksets with various numbers of prims, e.g.,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Linkset-10 is a linkset with 10 prims in it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     1. The rezzer reads data out of a notecard. It sees how many prims
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     should be in the next linkset and rezzes a linkset from its inventory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     with that number of prims.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     2. When the linkset rezzes, the root prim tells the rezzer that it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     alive and the rezzer sends it the UUID and line number of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     notecard to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     read via chat.  At this point, the rezzer goes back to Step 1.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     3. The root prim then sends a link message to its children telling
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the UUID and a line number to read.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     4.  Each prim in the linkset then reads their data independently from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the notecard and then performs llSetPrimitiveParams to transform
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     themselves into the shape determined by the notecard data.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     It's actually a lot more complicated than that, but you get the idea.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     So, lots of prims are being rezzed very quickly via LSL and each prim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     has a script in it that reads notecard data and sets params.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     In 0.6.5, this process runs very smoothly--prims and scripts are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     created
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and execute quickly.  In 0.6.6 and above, something is happening that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     drastically slows this process down.  Either the prims are rezzing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     slower, or the scripts are starting slower or the scripts are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     executing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     slower.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     In any event, the difference is extreme.  It is bad in 0.6.6 and seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to be even worse in 0.6.7.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?  Is this a bug?  Is it an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     inevitable fact of life?  Can it be improved?  What can I do to help
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     with the process?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I'm more than happy to create a video showing the difference.  The LSL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     scripts are open source.  I can also set you up with some test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     data and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     a copy of my maxport utility if anyone wants to try to reproduce
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     it.  It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     is very easy to do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Thanks in advance!  --Shack
