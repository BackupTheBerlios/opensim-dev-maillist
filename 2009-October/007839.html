</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's pretty standard practice across open source projects with more

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these purposes, since realtime chats aren't practical across  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> timezones.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Adam
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure I'd agree just how standard a process it is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The one's I've been involved with or otherwise have some detailed
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge of, have never had them; including such big names as GNOME,
</I>&gt;<i> Fedora, and Linux. For example the GNOME foundation list is not only
</I>&gt;<i> world-readable, but anyone can join:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/foundation-list">http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/foundation-list</A> . Actual
</I>&gt;<i> foundation members are voted by the community at large.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically the way they are able to operate is, they don't distribute
</I>&gt;<i> commit access according to monolithic vote of knighted members; they
</I>&gt;<i> have a system of maintainership, and each maintainer gives access
</I>&gt;<i> rights to his module/repo as she sees fit, in a web of trust.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the complaints one sometimes hears is how monolithic the
</I>&gt;<i> project is (even if the code-base is modular). Maybe the move to git,
</I>&gt;<i> and the maturation of the code allows more distribution and
</I>&gt;<i> specialization of responsibility?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My concerns with core mailing list are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. It's &quot;secret&quot;, ie. not world readable. I can understand limiting
</I>&gt;<i> membership to voting partners to avoid bikeshedding, but I can't
</I>&gt;<i> understand secrecy of any kind in an open source project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Decisions made there (aside from commit rights) affect other
</I>&gt;<i> people, and they not only have no voice to represent themselves, they
</I>&gt;<i> don't even get to know what is being said about them. That doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> seem fair somehow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The knowledge that someone can read what you write makes you think
</I>&gt;<i> harder about what you say. Maybe a private list makes the problem of
</I>&gt;<i> disagreement within core worse rather than better? I haven't the
</I>&gt;<i> faintest idea who this snowcrash guy is, but when I was a topic of
</I>&gt;<i> discussion on -core, I remember not liking it at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the issue of timezones, I understand that completely! Which is
</I>&gt;<i> why I wish you guys used ML more frequently! :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My intention is not to bike-shed, but to be productive. Either opensim
</I>&gt;<i> core is open to this point of view or it's not, and we move on from
</I>&gt;<i> there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers, and much love!
