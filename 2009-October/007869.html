<PRE>OK, since I have a nagging feeling no-one read Teravus's original post in this long thread (and with a hope of putting this to rest).

There are guidelines for the -core list, which are the following: 
If the topic can be discussed on dev, it should be. Core's scope is limited to issues related to commit access, licensing, money, server administrator and other 'meta' issues relating to running the project. No-one on dev is missing out on any development or code related discussion. Membership is limited to active committers (min. one commit in last 6 mo to maintain commit access &amp; ML access). 'Votes' are done on consensus with any committer having full veto power.

That said, DSVC is not a panacea to programming. Git is better than SVN at merging files; but it's still not excellent - Melanie puts in a ton of work each week in managing our various branches and bringing them together, conflicts and all. 

Until someone realises that DSVC needs to include language specific patterns (such as refactorings), there is still going to need to be a core project at the middle making sure the base works, and still a bunch more people who can update branches &amp; forks accordingly. Otherwise maintaining distributions becomes an effort in trying to hit moving targets.

Since it'll probably satisfy some of the people who are curious about what is discussed on core, here's the last 10 threads. (this represents probably 3-5 months of traffic, as I said before, it's low volume.) - as you can see, they all do fall into the guidelines listed above.

Last 10 threads on opensim-core:
1. Snowcrash's contributions - whether his eclectic license on SCEngine affects contributions to opensim master and specifically whether to accept patches relating to it. (Licensing.)
2. Mantis stopped sending emails, can someone look?
3. Where is the CS2JK license?
4. Forwarded a request for a spokesperson to speak to someone studying OSS communities.
5. Stefan announcing his resignation (cc:'d to dev)
6. JHurliman commit access [redux]?
7. Sean changing projects at IBM, resignation.
8. JHurliman commit access?
9. Request for moderator access on the wiki.
10. Vote on go/no-go on git after trial.

Regards,

Adam
