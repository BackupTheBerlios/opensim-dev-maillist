<PRE>My 2 cents here:

If you want a distribution that works, MAKE IT

I'm investing time of my own into OpenSim and making sure that the
modules that I created ALWAYS work with the latest versions of Core.

Some people even ask me sometimes why I take the time to make sure
that the modules I created or that I contributed on work with both a
release version but also the trunk.

Simple answer: I want to make sure that even a simple soul can
download, drop in a module and have it working.

&gt;<i> Well, to be honest OpenSim is designed so you don&#8217;t need to compile
</I>&gt;<i> something to install a module.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It should be just dumped into the OpenSim dir as a .dll, and it should be
</I>&gt;<i> picked up and loaded automatically &#8211; so people doing modules; you can ship
</I>&gt;<i> binaries, and they will be reasonably compatible with a range of OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> versions (but occasionally yes they will need to be recompiled to work
</I>&gt;<i> against trunk &#8211; especially during big internal shakeups). But that&#8217;s up to
</I>&gt;<i> you.

</I>&gt;<i> Mark's comment wasn't very well organized or thought out.&#160; It was basically
</I>&gt;<i> just an explosion of his frustration with OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But that doesn't mean that he doesn't have a few good points hidden in
</I>&gt;<i> there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that looking at most other software projects in the world, you
</I>&gt;<i> would find that &quot;core&quot; or &quot;base&quot; products did not come into existence in a
</I>&gt;<i> vacuum.&#160; They were developed with a specific end product in mind that solved
</I>&gt;<i> an immediate need and/or desire.&#160; The developers of the end product most
</I>&gt;<i> likely worked heavily on the core products. The effect of that end product
</I>&gt;<i> was the world getting to see how great the technology is.&#160; Once people see
</I>&gt;<i> the possibilities your core provides, they will build other great products
</I>&gt;<i> from it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't intend to say that the first end product has to share a repository
</I>&gt;<i> with the core code.&#160; Just that there needs to be an end product being work
</I>&gt;<i> on by core developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you need to include _every_ module in your releases?&#160; No.&#160; But you have
</I>&gt;<i> to do whatever it takes to make using the most common modules as easy as
</I>&gt;<i> possible.&#160; If half or even a 5th of your potential users want module X, then
</I>&gt;<i> it's fairly important that it's easy to install without knowing c#.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can do all of this the other way around -- but you're only hurting your
</I>&gt;<i> own popularity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Be excellent to each other and party on dudes!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;Having something that actually &quot;works&quot; is terrible? &#160;In my opinion, just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the opposite is true.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You can spend your whole life developing things (that no one actually

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You seem to prefer the latter.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *&gt; I think you, and maybe others here, may need to understand better this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>concept of extensible systems. That's at the very core of OpenSim from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>the beginning, even before I started contributing -- OpenSim is not an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>application, it's a platform with which to build applications.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think you need to sit down and understand the concept of &quot;working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> product&quot;. &#160;You also need to stop confusing &quot;extensible system&quot; with &quot;not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working&quot; product.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PHP, and Apache are what I would consider &quot;extensible systems&quot;. &#160;PHP is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easily downloaded, and it works (out of the box). &#160;Yet it comes with many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different modules (as part of the default distro) and those modules have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been thoroughly tested, and can easily be enabled by simply uncommenting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the module name in the default.ini file.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to include hooks and mechanisms for expanding/enhancing the system with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capabilities WITHOUT having to make major changes to the system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> infrastructure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim doesn't seem to be &quot;extensible&quot;. &#160;OpenSim seems to be &quot;broken&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;There is a big difference. &#160;Maybe your definition of &quot;extensible&quot; means
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it requires a rocket scientist just to get the trunk to even compile
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (or even work), and takes hours and hours of debugging code, just to get a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> module to even work. &#160;That isn't my idea of &quot;extensible&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I understand over the past few months, the server infrastructure (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> architecture) has been changing quite a bit. &#160;It's hard to even tell if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ModRex (or any other modules) even work with the current OpenSim trunk (or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> latest build) at this point.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The average layperson doesn't want to spend hours and hours trying to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compile from source, or debugging code, or searching for plugins/modules
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that may (or may not) exist, and even worse many of them may not be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> updated,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or may not even work with the current OpenSim as &quot;core&quot; evolves. &#160;Often
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> times many of these modules are not updated, and most have no clue how to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even build from source, and for this reason it might be good to just have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> VERY simple &quot;turn-key&quot; distributions available for download. (Stable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> releases)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Similar to how RealXtend has done in the past.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I supposed I could sit down and begin working on creating a fully
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configured
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> VMWare image &#160;of OpenSim with various modules installed and configured,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people could easily download, and be up and running in a few minutes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (without having to hunt for various modules, or applications), or sifting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through outdated wiki pages trying to figure out how to even get started
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even get up and running, but to be honest most people just want something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> VERY easy to use, VERY easy to setup, and would love a nice GUI interface
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (like WixTD, etc.) that they can use to administer the server, add users,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Most laypeople don't want to hire a software engineer, or a programmer,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to get OpenSim to compile, or even get a module working, or just to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim running on a machine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I want to use a plugin with Firefox, I've NEVER had to compile or debug
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code. &#160;If I want to enable a PHP module, I've NEVER had to debug any code.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;Most modules are included in the default distro, and modules can easily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> turned on and off, by simply &quot;enabling&quot; them in the default ini
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (configuration) file.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my opinion, you may be confusing &quot;extensible system&quot; as an excuse as to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> why nothing should work properly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my opinion, EVERY single working module that exists for OpenSim should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> included in the default distro (in the modules directory), and these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modules
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should ALL be disabled by default, but can be easily enabled by simply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uncommenting out ONE single line in the default.ini configuration file.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Include EVERY single working module with the default OpenSim distro, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> users have a list of default working modules that are regularly updated so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that they actually work (and are not broken), so that when a stable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> release
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comes out, a user can just enable or disable whatever modules they wish to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use (by uncommenting out a line or two in the default .ini configuration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file) and those modules are in the modules directory, and can easily be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enabled by just uncommenting out a single line in the default ini
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configuration file.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is, it seems like a herd of cats are headed in all opposite
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directions, and people really just want something that actually works.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;Diva, is that honestly too much to ask?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are Applications and there are Operating Systems. &#160;What do you call
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim? &#160;Is it an Application or an Operating System? &#160;(or is it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> neither?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When I say &quot;works&quot;, I'm talking about someone can download OpenSim, and be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up and running (designing things from within the OpenSim Application
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platform such as creating 3D content, in-world). &#160;Not sitting down and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> downloading source code, or attempting to figure out how to learn C# or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> C++
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or how to write a module, just to get simple things running.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The thing that made RealXtend so popular was that it was easy to use, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they had distros that were already setup and ready to use (even with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;beneath the sea&quot; demo world as part of the distro).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Keep in mind that most of the people interested in OpenSim as a 3D
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development platform are laypeople, and are graphics designers (and Second
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Life users) that are NOT Computer Science majors, and are not engineers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really don't know ANY programming languages (some may know a bit of Java,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTML, or LSL), but most don't even know C++ or C# nor would they have any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea how to even compile or build from source. &#160;They just want to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim to design 3D content, and create their own virtual world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you expect a web developer to know C? or C++? or C#?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Try thinking of OpenSim as a &quot;3D Web Server&quot; for users (similar to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apache).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;Yes, Apache is extensible, and many modules can be written for Apache,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most of the common modules are already tested and included with the Apache
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distro. &#160;Modules are tested, and included with all the latest releases,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> users can easily comment (or uncomment) out a single line in the default
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configuration file, and have the included modules working.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I believe the key to making OpenSim widely adopted as a &quot;usable&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platform
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for 3D developers, would be to make OpenSim easy to use (so that ANYONE
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get up and running in less than 10 minutes). &#160;I believe every single
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tested
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> module should be included with the default distro's. &#160;So that users can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easily enable/disable whatever modules they want, and users know that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modules included with each distro have been tested, and are working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modules.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At this point in time, does ANYONE actually know what works, and what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't work? &#160;Do we actually have a working distro, with working modules
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (that have been tested to work) with an actual OpenSim release?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since 0.7 release is supposed to be coming out soon (in a week?) is there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any way that we can stop development, and begin testing all the OpenSim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modules, and add all the OpenSim modules (that have been tested and are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working) to an OpenSim 0.7 release candidate?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RealXtend does a very good job of doing this (with their old distros), but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now that ModRex is integrated with OpenSim core, we're back to the drawing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> board again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If someone wants to enable ModRex, they should just be able to uncomment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a line in the default .ini file, and all the features of ModRex should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;If someone wants to enable currency, they should just be able to just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uncomment out a line in the default .ini file, and now the currency module
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be enabled.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why not make things SIMPLE and EASY to use?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If someone wants to write a module (and wants it included with the OpenSim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distro) then it needs to be tested, and once it has been tested (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> confirmed to work) then it can be included with the OpenSim distro. &#160;This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way at least we know what modules work (and are tested).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim has evolved so quickly, that I'm not quite sure what modules even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exist (or even work) at this point, and I have a few old distro's running,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I was too scared to even upgrade because everyone said that &quot;OpenSim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currently broken&quot; (due to all the latest changes) and people really just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really want a WORKING distro (with working modules).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm still running OpenSim 0.62 and ReX Server 0.4 on my local machines
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply because it has been months where things have been completely broken
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (as OpenSim trunk would not even compile) and OpenSim has been making some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> backend changes and I'm still not even sure that ModRex/RealXtend even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> works
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since it has migrated over to OpenSim?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think your definition of &quot;extensibility&quot; and &quot;extensible systems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> architecture&quot; is different from mine. &#160;I believe in having something that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ACTUALLY WORKS (out of the box), and extensibility means that new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capabilities could EASILY be added without having to make changes to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system infrastructure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Your definition of &quot;extensibility&quot; seems to mean, nothing works,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is broken, and you need to hire a software engineer just to get a few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> basic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modules up and running.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my opinion, &quot;extensibility&quot; means that all the various modules would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by default with the default OpenSim distro, and they could easily be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> turned
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on (enabled) or turned off (disabled) by simply uncommenting a line in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> default.ini file. &#160;Similar to PHP distro, or Apache server, or various
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platforms.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Either OpenSim is an Application or it's an Operating System. &#160;Since it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't run on bare metal, I certainly would NOT call it an Operating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> System, therefore I would consider it a software Application. &#160;I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consider OpenSim a 3D development platform.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my opinion, I would consider OpenSim a Server platform (software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application) and you need both the OpenSim Server (platform) and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compatible Viewer to make OpenSim work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is that OpenSim has evolved so much (and so quickly) that much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the Wiki documentation is outdated, no one is quite sure what even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> works
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at this point, and what doesn't work at this point. There is no list of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recently &quot;tested&quot; modules (that are known to work with the current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> build/latest distro).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Most &quot;noobs&quot; just really want a distro that they can easily download
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a VMWare format) so they can just fire up a pre-configured image, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up and running in minutes (instead of days or weeks).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm willing to help test, and I'm willing to help with documentation, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm willing to even create &quot;distros&quot; that are easy to use (and that are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tested and working) but it seems like nobody is working together.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What if we just STOPPED developing, for just ONE week, and worked together
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on creating an actual distro? &#160;Just a working (and well tested) distro,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is thoroughly tested, that is STABLE, and that has all the OpenSim modules
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working with it?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then release it as a OpenSim 0.7 release.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's all I ask. &#160;Then after OpenSim 0.7 release candidate comes out (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it well tested, and all the modules from the OpenSim GForge are tested to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work and be compatible with the 0.7 release, and then we wrap everything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and release it as a working distro!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just halt development for 1 week, and just focus on bug fixes, and getting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the modules to all work so we can just have a nice OpenSim 0.7 release
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> candidate, with lots of working modules (that are all tested) and are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> included in the default distro.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> People can still choose what modules they wish to enable, but at least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> include all the known working modules with the default distro (or create a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;vanilla&quot; distro, and a &quot;full distro&quot; with the OpenSim 0.7 Release). &#160;That
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way one has the working modules, and the other doesn't have the working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modules.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But this way at least we can have an actual TESTED release candidate, that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has all the working OpenSim modules (with updated documentation).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm willing to help with documentation, and testing, but I just want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an actual release candidate (with working modules) come out.
