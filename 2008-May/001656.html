</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You make some interesting points.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From where to where would the authentication traffic run?  What would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interpret it?  What would make the policy decision to show it?  What
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would decide whether to follow the policy decision handed down from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on-high?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What about assets with legitimate copyright confusion?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What about attempted denial-of-service by hacking the authentication system?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What if someone gets a leaked bitwise copy of an asset, uploads it to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and registers it with the authentication service, and prevents the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> legitimate owner of the asset from registering it?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What if some grid chooses, for these or other (perhaps more nefarious,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perhaps more practical -- such as overloading and very poor response)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasons, not to run the authentication traffic?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I must simply reiterate what I've said before... DRM simply does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work.  DRM relies on all parties except the end-user (you know, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entity that everyone is most concerned about) cooperating to restrict
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> access.  Independent VWs don't want to damage their users'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experiences, so they're unlikely to want to cooperate, and without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their cooperation there's no chance of implementing any kind of DRM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DRM relies on &quot;keeping secrets&quot;.  The core secret is &quot;the asset
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content to be displayed&quot;.  And, Benjamin Franklin put it best: &quot;Three
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may keep a secret, if two are dead.&quot;  An authentication system would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply offload the task of who makes the decision to keep the secret,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not do anything more to keep the secret in place.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And if you want to rely on the viewer to run it?  Someone's going to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hack the viewer to avoid authentication, and distribute their hacked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viewer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've been trying to find a way to design a system that doesn't rely on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making bits harder to copy.  I've been trying to find a way to design
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a system that doesn't rely on some arbitrary third party making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions.  I've been trying to find a way for evidence to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collected that would be sufficient to satisfy the only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currently-authorized-by-law third party (the court system), and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only in situations where it's been specifically asked to intervene.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The entire VW community, and the entire Internet community, has been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designing things at odds with the current legal regime since its dawn.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  We've seen the courts reach in and mandate things, and our tools have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been extremely unsuited to the task of compliance.  I'd much prefer to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have a design on the table that satisfies all the compliance issues in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a way that is easily understood.  I'd much prefer to have a design on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the table that stops viewing the end-user as an entity to be feared
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solely because they can take what they're shown and change themselves
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from 'end-user' to 'content presenter' without authorization of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> owner of the content they're presenting.  I'd like to move away from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any attempt to mandate content handling, and instead cooperate with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the end-user to identify locations where unauthorized copies of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content are distributed from, and leverage those to reduce the content
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> misappropriation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is why I want the viewer to be cooperative in a way that doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> damage the end-user's experience.  I realize I'm in the minority...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I'm sick of being treated like something less than a dignified
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> human being.  I'm sick of being treated like a criminal.  I'm sick of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my money going toward systems that prevent me from using what I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> licensed.
