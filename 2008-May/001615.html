<PRE>Hi

We at the realXtend project have been experimenting with asset portability for a while and it's certainly a very interesting subject for us. So far our plans are to use a service completely outside any specific grid, we call it &quot;Avatar storage&quot; and it's also used for storing the avatar appearance data. We're going to be running public tests some time soon and we'd love to discuss technical details with you guys, it would be great if we could come up with a scheme that would suit us all and could become a standard for open source virtual worlds.

Contact me or Jani if you are interested in more detailed discussions (I don't know the inner workings of the system very well, but I can get you in touch with people who do). We can of course also continue here if it's the best option for you guys?

Aihe: [Opensim-dev] More on asset portability

Hi,

Recently lulurun mailed about asset portability. Today I had a long
conversation with him, and I would like to restart the discussion from a
slightly different point of view.

What lulurun wants to do is to disconnect the asset and inventory
servers from a particular grid, so that it is possible to login on
another grid and still have access to your avatar, belongings etc. There
are already two fields (asseturl and inventoryurl) in the user server
that can be used for this purpose. The problem is that not all avatar
information is contained in the Inventory server. The user server
contains &quot;wearables&quot; data (list of UUID's). Now, the question is why
this information supplied by the user server. Wouldn't it be more
natural to have it in the Inventory Server?

If we clarified the roles of the user and inventory servers, and kept
all asset information in the inventory server, then it would be much
easier to use external inventory/asset servers. This means that we want
to move the AvatarAppearance API from the User server to the
InventoryServer. The logic would be changed so that the default
inventory and asset servers are used unless the asseturl and
inventoryurl are defined. That is, the grid would continue to use its
own asset and inventory servers unless you supply more information.

We plan to do work in this area soon, and welcome any feedback and
comment you have.

Cheers,
joha1
