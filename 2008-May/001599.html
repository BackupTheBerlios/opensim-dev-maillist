<PRE>My current throughts on your usecase:

&gt;<i>Grid A has all UGAI services.
</I>&gt;<i>Grid B also has all UGAI services.
</I>
UseCase I.
&gt;<i>User B (normally lives on Grid B) creates an account on Grid A.  How do
</I>&gt;<i>they specify their AI servers?  They also need to now duplicate all the
</I>&gt;<i>rest of their user info there (name, profile, etc.)?
</I>
AssetServer(Url) and InventoryServer(Url) of Grid B are publicly available.
When User B login to Grid A for the first time, User B can choose the 2
following methods to complete its registration:
 1. User B just do a ordinary registration at Grid A.
Grid A should provide the interface for User B to input its user info
(including name, profile, AI servers).
This process can be abbreviated if Grid B is able to provide User B's info
to another external service(Grid A) in a trusted way. This means, User B
only
tells Grid A its UserServerUrl(at Grid B), Grid A &quot;GetUserProfile&quot; from Grid
B.
 2. (ideal case) User OpenID.
OpenID has 2 useful extensions:
*. Attribute Exchange
<A HREF="http://openid.net/specs/openid-attribute-exchange-1_0.html">http://openid.net/specs/openid-attribute-exchange-1_0.html</A>
enable openid holder to store thier extra information(profile, AI servers)
*. Simple Registration
<A HREF="http://openid.net/specs/openid-simple-registration-extension-1_0.html">http://openid.net/specs/openid-simple-registration-extension-1_0.html</A>
when the authentication finished successfully, openid consumer(or relying
party,
in this case it is Grid A's UserServer) can get the extra information from
openid provider(in this case it is like <A HREF="http://www.myopenid.com">http://www.myopenid.com</A>).
User B has an OpenID at myopenid.com, Grid A supports OpenID login.
Grid A can get User B's full profile after authentication from myopenid.com.

UseCase II.
&gt;<i>User B uploads a texture, which AI does it go in?  User B puts that
</I>&gt;<i>texture on a surface, what AI does it live in?
</I>
Since AssetServer and InventoryServer has became properties of an user, when
an user specified AI server urls avaliable, regionserver should always
get/put
user owned assets from/to the user specified AI server.
So in this case,
* User B uploads a texture, it gose in Grid B's AI.
* User B puts that texture on a surface:
this is a quite complecated thing.
&quot;that texture&quot; belongs to User B, but when it is put on a region owned prim,
a copy of &quot;that texture&quot; should be made, and the copy should be saved in
Grid A's asset server. ...
yes,
*           &quot;More thought needed.&quot;  -- stefan*
:&gt;<i>
</I>We should build asset-fetching policies into region server.

Currently, as the first step, I am thinking about just enabling &quot;Appearance
Portability&quot;.
So as a start, do you agree with to put &quot;getUserAppearance&quot; in
InventoryServer
instead of in UserServer ?

regards,
lulurun
