<PRE>Recently, we've given distributed assets some thought. 
 
The base problem is that assets are (by sl legacy) requested by guid from the viewer to the region, and the question is how the region would know where to fetch that asset. So, in the case of avatar clothing, for example, we send a 'shirt' asset that within itself contains a shirt texture asset guid that is then requested from the viewer.
 
Now, the region only forwarded the shirt asset from the assetserver, so it actually doesn't know about the texture guid that was referenced within it.
 
But it still needs to know where to fetch the texture asset with that guid.
One solution that I can see would be if we scanned assets passing thru the server and kept track of the guids within it, tagging them with what asset they were referenced by. That would take a lot of processing power.
 
More thought needed.

This means that we want&gt; &gt; to move the AvatarAppearance API from the User server to the&gt; &gt; InventoryServer. The logic would be changed so that the default&gt; &gt; inventory and asset servers are used unless the asseturl and&gt; &gt; inventoryurl are defined. That is, the grid would continue to use its&gt; &gt; own asset and inventory servers unless you supply more information.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We plan to do work in this area soon, and welcome any feedback and&gt; &gt; comment you have.&gt; &gt; This sounds like an good idea.&gt; &gt; Could this be extended such that the inventory table contained the url of&gt; the asset server that stores item? This would then lead to a distributed&gt; asset system. Not all assets would need to come from the same asset server.&gt; &gt; Chris&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
