It does seem the moment we start talking about cross grid sharing of
services, we need to actually start putting authentication in these
communications.  While wild west has worked so far, having someone else
delete everything in my private inventory system probably isn't going to
fly.  People will assume because it is *their's* that there is some
protection on it.

A few questions and use cases.

Grid A has all UGAI services.

Grid B also has all UGAI services.

User B (normally lives on Grid B) creates an account on Grid A.  How do
they specify their AI servers?  They also need to now duplicate all the
rest of their user info there (name, profile, etc.)?

User B uploads a texture, which AI does it go in?  User B puts that
texture on a surface, what AI does it live in?

I definitely think we should start multiplexing AI services, as it would
be great to be able to easily plug in some stock content servers.
However, it seems like the complexity of user specific AI servers
explodes pretty quickly.  I've got 450 users on my test system.  Trying
to find an asset across 450 AI instances would really suck. :)

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
