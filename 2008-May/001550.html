 From what I've read of JSON, I don't believe it's tied to any specific 
language - to some extent it just happens to be directly evaluatable in 
Javascript since that was from where it originated.

However, I do personally prefer XML - there are just more tools and 
libraries out there for it and it's more familiar.  I'm not sure the 
possible advantages of JSON (e.g. less verbosity, though I'm not sure 
that's an issue here) outweigh that.

Oh, and regarding LLSD - yes, let's confine that to linden interop and 
not use it as our core REST format.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I would agree.  Let's have a nice simple REST interface (alongside the 
existing XMLRPC for now).  If we need to elaborate this can happen later 
on...
