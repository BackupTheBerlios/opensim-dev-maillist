<PRE>I see the seperation and modularization of the opensim differently

my personal view is this...

each &quot;grid&quot; has own &quot;U G&quot; and &quot;A I&quot; are decoupled,

  Users from any Grid can use Asset services from one or more,
  and the U service for OpenSIM is like &quot;customs&quot; for the G managed Regions,

Inventory is localized for on-grid asset and inventory but each &quot;User&quot;
  has provision for use of a non-local &quot;Inventory&quot; service...

an example,

User A from Grid A wants access to Grid B

  User A approachs Grid B and obtains a &quot;passport&quot; sign-in for Grid B,
  then User A would need to travel an &quot;inter-connect&quot; between grids

Each &quot;Grid&quot; being like a Glass walled garden... you can sign-up and view
  using a &quot;blank&quot; AV for that Grid... but the Interconnect is where
  content and Users can &quot;crossover&quot; between grids

Ive already got a sketch for this written up and I am currently trying
to sort out
  getting two machines to independantly run standalone UGAIR of a single region
  to experiment with making this work,  having an AV for each able to
cross to the other.

I see the &quot;interconnect&quot; as a similar mechanism to International Customs...
  a policy agreement between grids is required... and the interconnect
cant just let &quot;anything&quot; go through
  which also mandates some kind of grid-local &quot;Garbage collector&quot; system

There is a LOT of cross-over between the interconnection of grids and
the mass-access of content,
  but each &quot;interconnect&quot; setup is going to require that there is some
kind of &quot;iptables ruleset&quot;
  in scripting was is permitted and what is denied with the final say
being down to some kind of administrative
  policy... the technology needs to allow for flexibility in what
policy decisions can be made.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be people willing to pay. Maybe. There's certainly a [small] market
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; clone detection in source code and other artifacts that are time-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consuming to produce.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i think there's a huge market out there. and it will grow with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; growth of VWs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People have different needs when it comes to asset protection, and one model
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't fit all. This should be configurable at server init time. Here are
</I>&gt;<i> three of the most prevalent models, the third one being a hybrid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - People want all their inworld assets protected from being copied. This
</I>&gt;<i> means that there should be a lot of guards upfront. It's conceivable that
</I>&gt;<i> someone might develop a DRM module for OpenSim; but I don't think that
</I>&gt;<i> should be in the OpenSim core, because this kind of protection, besides
</I>&gt;<i> being a conceptual quagmire, is not a universal need. A more lightweight
</I>&gt;<i> manner of addressing this need is to use the walled-garden model of grids,
</I>&gt;<i> which somewhat restricts who has access to the inworld assets, and then have
</I>&gt;<i> people sign a very strict ToS, and enforce that with severe real-world
</I>&gt;<i> penalties. Example on the Web: facebook.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - People don't care much about their inworld assets being copied by
</I>&gt;<i> hackers, what they care most is to attract lots of visitors to their sites,
</I>&gt;<i> or even just expressing themselves in public. So free access to images, etc,
</I>&gt;<i> are a tool for traffic, it puts their message out there; not just people
</I>&gt;<i> traffic but all sorts of backend info gathering traffic, for example
</I>&gt;<i> crawlers for search engines. In this scenario, there is no need for backend
</I>&gt;<i> asset copy-protection mechanisms, just front-end protection and declarations
</I>&gt;<i> of copyrights. This is the prevalent model of the [public] Web.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3 - People care somewhat about their inworld assets being copied, while at
</I>&gt;<i> the same time caring to attract visitors, therefore benefiting from
</I>&gt;<i> operating in open grids and open sims. A lot of web sites fall on this
</I>&gt;<i> category. This is the model that would benefit from having open access to
</I>&gt;<i> assets along with a monitoring system for detecting copyright violations. As
</I>&gt;<i> Dr. Scofield said, some people care to do this on the public web too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that all of these models can work with the techniques that we were
</I>&gt;<i> talking on this thread -- REST access, pulling UAI out of the OpenSim core.
</I>&gt;<i> For walled-gardens, it's &quot;just&quot; a matter of authenticating the callers. This
</I>&gt;<i> kind of ACL is routine on the Web, session keys, etc., so it should be
</I>&gt;<i> feasible in OpenSim too. I think this is possible without having to change
</I>&gt;<i> the viewer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (As an important aside, assets and inventory are not the same thing.
</I>&gt;<i> Inventory should always be private and protected. My use of the word asset
</I>&gt;<i> means inworld object.)
</I>&gt;<i>
