<PRE>Hi

Being off-topic is a valid concern, some conversation on the subject is probably fine to get some opinions and consider the potential impact on OpenSim (the external modules could for example need some support functionality in the core architecture etc.), but in general this discussion should probably happen somewhere else. But the subject is important and so is the discussion, which means that we really should find the appropriate forum.

Being open source doesn't mean you have to give up hopes of being secure. For example Linux's inner workings are pretty well known, but cracking the system is still not exactly trivial. And as long as OpenSim is BSD, adding proprietary solutions is quite simple, if deemed necessary. It's important to remember that nothing's really 100% secure, but if the most important and popular sites and avatar services have the protection on, it'll probably be a very strong incentive for not resorting to piracy.

Aihe: Re: [Opensim-dev] Interrelated difficult problems related to asset        portability

I hate to sound like a downer on the subject, but i personally dont see how DRM can work when 100% of the code will be opensource if its included in the OpenSIM SVN..  im not quite sure this is totally appropriate topic for opensim-dev.. The only way i could see this working is if individual grids develop something for their own use and keep the source closed..  just my two cents..
