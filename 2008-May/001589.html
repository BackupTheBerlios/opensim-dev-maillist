<PRE>I have to key on the words &quot;disconnect the asset and inventory servers from a particular grid&quot;.

Are you proposing that there be a planetary asset and inventory server at 3di for the entire Metaverse?

How would you see this working in a world with multiple grids and multiple use cases?

Subject: [Opensim-dev] More on asset portability

Hi,

Recently lulurun mailed about asset portability. Today I had a long 
conversation with him, and I would like to restart the discussion from a 
slightly different point of view.

What lulurun wants to do is to disconnect the asset and inventory 
servers from a particular grid, so that it is possible to login on 
another grid and still have access to your avatar, belongings etc. There 
are already two fields (asseturl and inventoryurl) in the user server 
that can be used for this purpose. The problem is that not all avatar 
information is contained in the Inventory server. The user server 
contains &quot;wearables&quot; data (list of UUID's). Now, the question is why 
this information supplied by the user server. Wouldn't it be more 
natural to have it in the Inventory Server?

If we clarified the roles of the user and inventory servers, and kept 
all asset information in the inventory server, then it would be much 
easier to use external inventory/asset servers. This means that we want 
to move the AvatarAppearance API from the User server to the 
InventoryServer. The logic would be changed so that the default 
inventory and asset servers are used unless the asseturl and 
inventoryurl are defined. That is, the grid would continue to use its 
own asset and inventory servers unless you supply more information.

We plan to do work in this area soon, and welcome any feedback and 
comment you have.

Cheers,
joha1
