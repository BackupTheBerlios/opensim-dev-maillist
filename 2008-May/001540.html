<PRE>I think the path of inventing new standards should indicate we avoid
LLSD - it's only used for Linden technologies, and it could lead us to a
sort of 'vendor lock in' problem down the road if it never gains
industry adoption (something I don't think is possible given Stefan's
observations)

I personally cast my vote towards plain XML - whether we autoserialise
or not, the reason being it involves the least new things, we can attach
a DTD for specifics and we don't need to introduce any dependencies to
handle it. 

Regards,

Adam

XmlSerializer? JSON?

Use the LLSD implementation in libsecondlife.  It has the advantage of 
being already done. We should be breaking LLSD out into its own library 
soon, so OpenSim won't need a newer version.

LLSD has a few serialization formats.  XML of course as well as a binary

serialization and a notation format that looks like JSON. I'm not sure 
if it is valid JSON or not.
An argument against the LLSD notation format from John Hurliman

which makes some good points.
