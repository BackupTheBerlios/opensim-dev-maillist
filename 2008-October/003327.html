<PRE>That sounds like a very good idea. So if I got that right, when one teleports to a certain grid they would only temporarily take all the assets they have in their inventory or attached to the avatar from the grid they come from to the grid they go to? Then, once they leave the grid, these assets would be forgotten on the grid they only visited? That sounds like a good plan and most economical and safe method I'd say. And to avoid the &quot;can't use multiple asset servers at the same time&quot; client issue, every user who teleports to the visiting grid could just upload all assets in its inventory and attachments to that grid's grid asset server and delete them when logging out and not being on the grid any longer.

A question that's raised however is; Will these assets be taken there temporarily or permanently? What if someone wants to make something there and take it back to the other grid and in its assets? I was looking at the &quot;Multiple 'My Inventory' entries&quot; issue again a few days ago... maybe we can make a My Inventory root folder for every grid and every user would have two My Inventory's one for the grid they came from and one for the grid they're visiting? One of them would be used temporarily for the grid you are visiting and if you want to keep it permanently you move it to the real My Inventory in that case. The OSGrid outage issue that created that problem proved you can have multiple My Inventory sets under inventory, so maybe that could be an interesting method.

As for the UUID conflict (because yes, as many billions of UUID combinations as there are on a grid as wide as LL's for example conflict is very likely), I guess that the only thing we can do in the situation of a conflict is to assign a new UUID to the asset which conflicts with an already-there asset that has the same UUID. But also do that to anything referencing that asset so we won't end up with gray textures and missing sounds in such a scenario.

Dear Mircea:

My perception of how the asset thing will work for some time is to view it as if one goes to an airport and passes through security.

The country (aka grid) one left is not available anymore. The country (aka grid) one is going to will have an asset server. What you can take through the teleport will be a very small subset of ones possessions. That is, perhaps the clothes on ones back, but certainly not the AK-47 or the flaming battle sword.

Me too. I would be curious to ask two questions now, one of them related to that. First question is, how do you set that up on your own opensim so far? Is the inter-grid teleporting system in the core yet or just an experimental separate application? Will there be a way from opensim.ini to do that experimentally soon?

My second question is something on longer term related to the technical part; I'm curious what will be done with the assets in this situation and with fetching them, and here I mean how one can sit on one grid and use assets and inventory from both that grid and another one. There are two problems here; First of them (smallest one) is the possibility of UUID conflicts. Lets say for example that someone uploads a texture on OSGrid and uses it in their inventory. Now they cross-grid TP to the LL grid, and in order for stuff to work correctly both the OSGrid asset server and LL grid asset server must be
 used. However, if the UUID of that texture he just uploaded on OSGrid is the same as the UUID of another texture / asset already on the LL grid, there will be a UUID conflict.

Second problem as the devs have been discussing is that the SL client can only support one asset server at a time. So if you go into another grid like that normally you must have both the assets of the grid you come from and the ones of the grid you go to at the same time. So yeah I was curious if anything is intended or known about these problems so far... one way or another I guess they will be gotten through so yeah.
