<PRE>Hi,

for my experience, ObjectUpdate and LayerData need to be reliable. 
The loss of those packet types causes bomb craters and ghost prims.

I am totally -1 on changing that in trunk without any option to set 
a flag or something to make them reliable.

I actually modify my opensims to never discard those at all. If I 
don't do that, 12000+ prim sims just won't work.

I will write a bit of code to allow that to be set in the packet 
handler in a bit. Then people who want to can use that to experiment.

</I>&gt;<i> A vast number of the packets that we send out from OpenSim (usually &gt;95% according to the statistics printed to the

</I>&gt;<i> In a private experiment I've set Header.Reliable = false for the LayerDataPacket and ObjectUpdatePacket (which appear to 
</I>&gt;<i> be the greatest sent by count, and which are currently reliable by default in libOMV).  Naturally, this cuts down the 
</I>&gt;<i> vast number of resends (and possibly some of the packet_out_of_order messages that come out on the console log) without 
</I>&gt;<i> any apparant ill effects.  However, my testing has been pretty limited so I'm minded to wait until Monday before making 
</I>&gt;<i> any trunk changes, since then I can get a better load test with multiple avatars (this doesn't stop anybody else testing 
</I>&gt;<i> of course :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any opinions on this?  Is there a good reason for these packets to remain reliable (when resends are probably rare 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway)?  libOMV appears to mark every packet as reliable by default...  and then OpenSim removes this from a couple of 
</I>&gt;<i> them but not from others.
