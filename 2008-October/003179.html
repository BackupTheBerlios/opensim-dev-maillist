</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a private experiment I've set Header.Reliable = false for the LayerDataPacket and ObjectUpdatePacket (which appear to 
</I>&gt;<i> be the greatest sent by count, and which are currently reliable by default in libOMV).  Naturally, this cuts down the 
</I>&gt;<i> vast number of resends (and possibly some of the packet_out_of_order messages that come out on the console log) without 
</I>&gt;<i> any apparant ill effects.  However, my testing has been pretty limited so I'm minded to wait until Monday before making 
</I>&gt;<i> any trunk changes, since then I can get a better load test with multiple avatars (this doesn't stop anybody else testing 
</I>&gt;<i> of course :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any opinions on this?  Is there a good reason for these packets to remain reliable (when resends are probably rare 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway)?  libOMV appears to mark every packet as reliable by default...  and then OpenSim removes this from a couple of 
</I>&gt;<i> them but not from others.

When you do the &quot;no ill effects&quot; test makes sure to put yourself on a
lossy network, like a slow DSL connection or a cellular modem link,
where you'll actually drop 30% of your packets.  Ter did this early on
to make sure our bw code was doing anything useful in these cases.

Testing for no ill effects on a good ethernet link is a non-test, as you
aren't actually seeing what happens if you drop packets.
