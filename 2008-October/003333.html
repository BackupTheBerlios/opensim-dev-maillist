Cool, thanks Cristina, glad to know that we're on the same wavelength :)

I'm sure there will be interest from core developers - there has been occasional conversation about looking at 
alternative ways of doing things.  But again, kudos for actually doing something - rough running code is always better 
than talk :)

I'm quite keen myself but unfortunately more prosaic OpenSim server bugs keep hitting me in the face in such a way that 
I need to fix them for one reason or another.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is also an argument that such modules should eventually be outside the core anyway.  The OGP modules we have are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in there because our region infrastructure module isn't advanced enough to make it easy to host these outside of core. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is something we should address (either having some protocol modules in or having them all out).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> +1 on that too. The hypergrid extension would be even simpler than what 
</I>&gt;<i> already is if only I could define externally what the comm module is. I 
</I>&gt;<i> suspect OGP suffers from the same problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's not to say that this isn't very interesting work, Cristina.  Does the code fit into the module structure?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. As I said, the only weirdness comes because I can't spec the comms 
</I>&gt;<i> module. If you change that, it will be a charm (modulo some visibility 
</I>&gt;<i> changes here and there).
</I>
Yep, apologies for not reading your previous e-mail carefully enough.  When I get a chance, I'll see if I can look at 
your code and change the structure such that things are easier in this respect (unless someone else does it first).  Of 
course, a patch to do such a thing is one that would be very welcome and quickly applied too.

&gt;&gt;<i> I had thoughts along similar lines for distributed grids.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I never actually implemented anything = so fair do's to Cristina.  Also, my thoughts were to conduct everything 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client side.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem does some with asset and inventory and routing this information around.  My thinking was that it would be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better if the client fetch this information directly rather than via the sim, but this would require extensive (and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably difficult) client changes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> A smarter client would make a lot of things a lot easier...
</I>
God yes.  Sometimes I think the fact that it is GPL'd has been a blessing in disguise - it allows us to implement a lot 
of OpenSim without accompanying time spent thinking about the client.  But it seems that things are getting to the stage 
where the restrictions are as painful as they are beneficial.
