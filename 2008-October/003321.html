</I>&gt;<i> opensim.ini to do that experimentally soon?
</I>It's not in the core. It would be great if it makes it there :-) It will 
be really easy to merge.
Since the architecture of OpenSim is so good (I've said this many times 
before!), the extension I made is really modular and simple. The only 
weirdness is having to subclass OpenSim.cs, so that I can instantiate 
the hypergrid comms instead of the default comms.

&gt;<i> My second question is something on longer term related to the 
</I>&gt;<i> technical part; I'm curious what will be done with the assets in this 
</I>&gt;<i> situation and with fetching them, and here I mean how one can sit on 
</I>&gt;<i> one grid and use assets and inventory from both that grid and another 
</I>&gt;<i> one. There are two problems here; First of them (smallest one) is the 
</I>&gt;<i> possibility of UUID conflicts. Lets say for example that someone 
</I>&gt;<i> uploads a texture on OSGrid and uses it in their inventory. Now they 
</I>&gt;<i> cross-grid TP to the LL grid, and in order for stuff to work correctly 
</I>&gt;<i> both the OSGrid asset server and LL grid asset server must be used. 
</I>&gt;<i> However, if the UUID of that texture he just uploaded on OSGrid is the 
</I>&gt;<i> same as the UUID of another texture / asset already on the LL grid, 
</I>&gt;<i> there will be a UUID conflict.
</I>For this issue, I'm relying on probabilities &amp; statistics! I hope the 
math delivers :-)
But I confess I feel a bit nervous about this too. I would feel a lot 
more comfortable if UUIDs would be suffixed with a domain name, or if 
they encoded domain names, so that ambiguity would be impossible, not 
just improbable.

&gt;<i> Second problem as the devs have been discussing is that the SL client 
</I>&gt;<i> can only support one asset server at a time. So if you go into another 
</I>&gt;<i> grid like that normally you must have both the assets of the grid you 
</I>&gt;<i> come from and the ones of the grid you go to at the same time. So yeah 
</I>&gt;<i> I was curious if anything is intended or known about these problems so 
</I>&gt;<i> far... one way or another I guess they will be gotten through so yeah.
</I> From what I hear, there is a distributed asset server in the making. 
We'll have to exchange some ideas.
It's too bad that the client is so attached to the one-mamma model. We 
need to constantly trick it on the server side.
