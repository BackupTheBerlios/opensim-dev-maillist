<PRE>I know they aren't ignored on purpose, just thought they might have been forgotten dead somewhere at the bottom of the bug tracker due to being too small. I know these are some very small things some of them just so the world looks nicer, so yeah these musn't bother any of the important stuff out there. I'd love to submit patches myself but I can't understand c# well enough and the patches I can make are minimal. I'd gladly post anything new that comes up though... I found no more new info on these features otherwise I would have posted more but if I find anything new I'll make sure to also note down the details. Sorry if the mailing list was a bad place for this though... maybe I should indeed try the Wiki or somewhere else where it might fit better then.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Small but important things

I don't think the items you listed were being ignored on purpose. There are several factors at stake which could influence the order in which mantis items receive attention. There are few developers for OpenSimulator and many of them are uncompensated for their efforts and can only work on it as time permits. Many of these developers do not consider OpenSimulator to be a perfect clone of the SL server, but have other applications they are working towards. There are a few developers who are striving for a close match and they may be quite busy at times. This can often be at odds with a growing user community that has expectations for a free SL server clone. Another thing to consider is the state of development of OpenSimulator, which is quite early and there are many large pieces that need a lot of work before the final touches can be addressed. Often the user community will submit patches for their favorite features that the core developers haven't had time or resources to work on yet, and these are usually accepted along with a measure of gratitude. If the patches cannot be accepted the reasons are communicated with the submitter(s) who can then modify and resubmit them if they so choose.

I suggest a more suitable means to bring attention to your items would be to attach notes with additional observations or implementation suggestions to the original issue entries. This would make them appear at the top of the list again and raise developer attention. Use of this mailing list would be more suited to discussion of implementation details rather than item priority.
