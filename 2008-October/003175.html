<PRE>Hmm, yes

By the way, you may want to ignore my earlier yammerings - I'm not able to reproduce consistent numbers at the moment - 
the 95% I had might have been an anomaly.

The best thing to do is probably to look at which packets the Linden grid is marking as reliable and do the same thing 
for now, if we are actually doing anything different.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Hi there,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     A vast number of the packets that we send out from OpenSim (usually
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;95% according to the statistics printed to the
</I>&gt;<i>     Linden viewer log on shutdown) are marked as reliable.  This
</I>&gt;<i>     requires that the viewer respond with an ack, and it just
</I>&gt;<i>     doesn't appear that this is done very well when a large number of
</I>&gt;<i>     reliables are sent.  A lot of acks never come and we
</I>&gt;<i>     often appear to end up resending thousands (or in the worst case
</I>&gt;<i>     tens of thousands) of packets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     In a private experiment I've set Header.Reliable = false for the
</I>&gt;<i>     LayerDataPacket and ObjectUpdatePacket (which appear to
</I>&gt;<i>     be the greatest sent by count, and which are currently reliable by
</I>&gt;<i>     default in libOMV).  Naturally, this cuts down the
</I>&gt;<i>     vast number of resends (and possibly some of the packet_out_of_order
</I>&gt;<i>     messages that come out on the console log) without
</I>&gt;<i>     any apparant ill effects.  However, my testing has been pretty
</I>&gt;<i>     limited so I'm minded to wait until Monday before making
</I>&gt;<i>     any trunk changes, since then I can get a better load test with
</I>&gt;<i>     multiple avatars (this doesn't stop anybody else testing
</I>&gt;<i>     of course :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Any opinions on this?  Is there a good reason for these packets to
</I>&gt;<i>     remain reliable (when resends are probably rare
</I>&gt;<i>     anyway)?  libOMV appears to mark every packet as reliable by
</I>&gt;<i>     default...  and then OpenSim removes this from a couple of
</I>&gt;<i>     them but not from others.
