Strong -1 on committing this code directly to core at this stage.

Charles, I strongly believe it would be better for us to see this mature a little as an external module first, rather 
than committing code directly to core.  Please could we hold off at least until the code has reached some level of 
maturity, at which point we can have a discussion about what we want to do.

This would be the same policy that we've tried to establish in the wake of other architectural changes (such as secure 
inventory) which really need some review and consideration first

There is also an argument that such modules should eventually be outside the core anyway.  The OGP modules we have are 
in there because our region infrastructure module isn't advanced enough to make it easy to host these outside of core. 
This is something we should address (either having some protocol modules in or having them all out).

That's not to say that this isn't very interesting work, Cristina.  Does the code fit into the module structure?

I had thoughts along similar lines for distributed grids.

but I never actually implemented anything = so fair do's to Cristina.  Also, my thoughts were to conduct everything 
client side.

The problem does some with asset and inventory and routing this information around.  My thinking was that it would be 
better if the client fetch this information directly rather than via the sim, but this would require extensive (and 
probably difficult) client changes.

</I>&gt;<i> I can instantiate the hypergrid comms instead of the default comms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My second question is something on longer term related to the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technical part; I'm curious what will be done with the assets in this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> situation and with fetching them, and here I mean how one can sit on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one grid and use assets and inventory from both that grid and another 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one. There are two problems here; First of them (smallest one) is the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possibility of UUID conflicts. Lets say for example that someone 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uploads a texture on OSGrid and uses it in their inventory. Now they 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cross-grid TP to the LL grid, and in order for stuff to work correctly 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both the OSGrid asset server and LL grid asset server must be used. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, if the UUID of that texture he just uploaded on OSGrid is the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same as the UUID of another texture / asset already on the LL grid, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there will be a UUID conflict.
</I>&gt;<i> For this issue, I'm relying on probabilities &amp; statistics! I hope the 
</I>&gt;<i> math delivers :-)
</I>&gt;<i> But I confess I feel a bit nervous about this too. I would feel a lot 
</I>&gt;<i> more comfortable if UUIDs would be suffixed with a domain name, or if 
</I>&gt;<i> they encoded domain names, so that ambiguity would be impossible, not 
</I>&gt;<i> just improbable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Second problem as the devs have been discussing is that the SL client 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can only support one asset server at a time. So if you go into another 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grid like that normally you must have both the assets of the grid you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come from and the ones of the grid you go to at the same time. So yeah 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was curious if anything is intended or known about these problems so 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> far... one way or another I guess they will be gotten through so yeah.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;From what I hear, there is a distributed asset server in the making. 
</I>&gt;<i> We'll have to exchange some ideas.
</I>&gt;<i> It's too bad that the client is so attached to the one-mamma model. We 
</I>&gt;<i> need to constantly trick it on the server side.
