<PRE>Hi again,

there may be some object updates that can be sent unreliable. For 
instance, all that have to do with moving objects (e.g. velocity != 
0). but the initial object update can't be lost. Any object update 
lost of the login burst is a ghost prim.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi there,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A vast number of the packets that we send out from OpenSim (usually &gt;95% according to the statistics printed to the
</I>&gt;<i> Linden viewer log on shutdown) are marked as reliable.  This requires that the viewer respond with an ack, and it just
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't appear that this is done very well when a large number of reliables are sent.  A lot of acks never come and we
</I>&gt;<i> often appear to end up resending thousands (or in the worst case tens of thousands) of packets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a private experiment I've set Header.Reliable = false for the LayerDataPacket and ObjectUpdatePacket (which appear to
</I>&gt;<i> be the greatest sent by count, and which are currently reliable by default in libOMV).  Naturally, this cuts down the
</I>&gt;<i> vast number of resends (and possibly some of the packet_out_of_order messages that come out on the console log) without
</I>&gt;<i> any apparant ill effects.  However, my testing has been pretty limited so I'm minded to wait until Monday before making
</I>&gt;<i> any trunk changes, since then I can get a better load test with multiple avatars (this doesn't stop anybody else testing
</I>&gt;<i> of course :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any opinions on this?  Is there a good reason for these packets to remain reliable (when resends are probably rare
</I>&gt;<i> anyway)?  libOMV appears to mark every packet as reliable by default...  and then OpenSim removes this from a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> them but not from others.
</I>&gt;<i>
