Dear Crista:

I have no problem supporting and committing patches to core from your efforts. Please move forward as you see appropriate.

Charles

Me too. I would be curious to ask two
questions now, one of them related to that. First question is, how do
you set that up on your own opensim so far? Is the inter-grid
teleporting system in the core yet or just an experimental separate
application? Will there be a way from opensim.ini to do that
experimentally soon?

It's not in the core. It would be great if it makes it there :-) It
will be really easy to merge.
Since the architecture of OpenSim is so good (I've said this many times
before!), the extension I made is really modular and simple. The only
weirdness is having to subclass OpenSim.cs, so that I can instantiate
the hypergrid comms instead of the default comms. 


My second question is something on
longer term related to the technical part; I'm curious what will be
done with the assets in this situation and with fetching them, and here
I mean how one can sit on one grid and use assets and inventory from
both that grid and another one. There are two problems here; First of
them (smallest one) is the possibility of UUID conflicts. Lets say for
example that someone uploads a texture on OSGrid and uses it in their
inventory. Now they cross-grid TP to the LL grid, and in order for
stuff to work correctly both the OSGrid asset server and LL grid asset
server must be used. However, if the UUID of that texture he just
uploaded on OSGrid is the same as the UUID of another texture / asset
already on the LL grid, there will be a UUID conflict.

For this issue, I'm relying on probabilities &amp; statistics! I hope
the math delivers :-)
But I confess I feel a bit nervous about this too. I would feel a lot
more comfortable if UUIDs would be suffixed with a domain name, or if
they encoded domain names, so that ambiguity would be impossible, not
just improbable.


Second problem as the devs have been discussing is that
the SL client can only support one asset server at a time. So if you go
into another grid like that normally you must have both the assets of
the grid you come from and the ones of the grid you go to at the same
time. So yeah I was curious if anything is intended or known about
these problems so far... one way or another I guess they will be gotten
through so yeah.
