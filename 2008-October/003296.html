<PRE>Well,

Sounds VERY interresting ... and exciting :))
Let me make some tests ...
But sure I'll need some help soon ;)

regards,
Ursula.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I started working on an extension to OpenSim that makes it work in
</I>&gt;<i> peer-to-peer mode, i.e. no need for grid servers to help the process  
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> teleporting and more, which I explain below.  I'm really excited to  
</I>&gt;<i> say
</I>&gt;<i> that this is working! -- I hope some of you are interested in trying  
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> out, and helping out too!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The project is called the HyperGrid. Hypergrid is an existing
</I>&gt;<i> theoretical concept in p2p networks which maps reasonably well to what
</I>&gt;<i> I'm doing here, so I borrowed the name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Comments, suggestions, contributions, ... welcome!
</I>&gt;<i> Crista / Diva
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** OpenSim HyperGrid**
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The basic idea of p2p is that nodes define networks by linking to  
</I>&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;<i> nodes. Unfortunately, this concept doesn't map too well to the concept
</I>&gt;<i> of a 2-dimensional map of &quot;the world&quot; (i.e. &quot;the grid&quot;). What does
</I>&gt;<i> position (Xloc, YLoc) mean in p2p where there is no central authority?
</I>&gt;<i> The 2-dimensional map is quite interesting in VWs, so we should  
</I>&gt;<i> continue
</I>&gt;<i> to use it. Should someone coordinate the allocation of sims  to grid
</I>&gt;<i> positions world-wide?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Enters hypergrid. In an hypergrid of p2p nodes there is no central
</I>&gt;<i> authority for allocating nodes to grid positions. The position of  
</I>&gt;<i> peers
</I>&gt;<i> in the map is determined locally by the node itself, and not by any
</I>&gt;<i> global entity. As we move from peer to peer, we are presented  
</I>&gt;<i> completely
</I>&gt;<i> different grids. For example, my node can connect to CNN's world  
</I>&gt;<i> placing
</I>&gt;<i> it in position 10, 10 of my grid; but when I TP to CNN, I am presented
</I>&gt;<i> with a totally different grid: the node that I TP-ed to is probably  
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> at position 10, 10 of its local grid; my own node is probably not in
</I>&gt;<i> CNN's grid at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These links are the VW-equivalent of web hyperlinks. Some  
</I>&gt;<i> comparisons to
</I>&gt;<i> the Web:
</I>&gt;<i> - Just like hypertext links, hyperworld links are uni-directional.
</I>&gt;<i> - The establishment of hyperworld links by region administrators is
</I>&gt;<i> [sort of] equivalent to writing a web page with hypertext links to  
</I>&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;<i> web sites.
</I>&gt;<i> - A web page with external links can be thought of as a 1D Map. The VW
</I>&gt;<i> Map happens to be 2D.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've implemented a console command that looks like this:
</I>&gt;<i> link-region 10 10 ucigrid02.nacs.uci.edu 9000
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 10, 10 is the position on the local grid
</I>&gt;<i> ucigrid02.nacs.uci.edu and 9000 are the host and port respectively of
</I>&gt;<i> the remote opensim
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once this link is established, we can interact with this peer in the
</I>&gt;<i> normal way. It will show up in the local map at position 10, 10. We  
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> TP to it via the map. (I'm still debating whether adjacencies should  
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> allowed or not; they bring along child agents that can overload the
</I>&gt;<i> remote regions; but that's a detail)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have this working already, and that leads to a whole other topic:  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> topic of maintaining identity and accessing inventory. This second  
</I>&gt;<i> part
</I>&gt;<i> is not done yet, so once you TP out you loose access to your  
</I>&gt;<i> inventory.
</I>&gt;<i> If the viewer would cooperate, this would be infinitely easier, but
</I>&gt;<i> since we're assuming the LL viewer for the foreseeable future, this
</I>&gt;<i> needs a bit of server-side trickery.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *** Trying it out ***
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please get the sources from svn and follow the instructions in  
</I>&gt;<i> README.txt:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/hypergrid/">http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/hypergrid/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If things are not clear, don't hesitate in emailing me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *** Implementation ***
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The implementation of HyperGrid is a thin layer on top of the existing
</I>&gt;<i> protocols, Local and OGS1. The classes reuse the OpenSim framework
</I>&gt;<i> massively by inheritance, delegation and, when those fail, copy&amp;paste.
</I>&gt;<i> The major crux of the idea is the management of region handles, which
</I>&gt;<i> need to be mapped between the local grid and the remote node's grid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are two sets of classes so that HyperGrid works both for
</I>&gt;<i> standalones and grid-ed opensims.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** Of interest to OpenSim architects: in order to instantiate these
</I>&gt;<i> classes, I had to subclass Region.Application.OpenSim and override a
</I>&gt;<i> bunch of things, especially the Startup methods which hard-code the
</I>&gt;<i> communication protocol class names. So if there's a way of  
</I>&gt;<i> modularizing
</I>&gt;<i> that better, it would be good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** Of interest to Open Grid Protocol people: I didn't use any of your
</I>&gt;<i> code/concepts, for the following reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> a) It wasn't clear that what you are doing is an hypergrid model vs
</I>&gt;<i> simply supporting TPs between LL and opensim servers on the same grid.
</I>&gt;<i> b) OGP seems to be designed for talking to LL's servers. I wanted to  
</I>&gt;<i> do
</I>&gt;<i> something for opensim, because it's the only server code I have for
</I>&gt;<i> experimentation.
</I>&gt;<i> But I think that once the p2p protocols are clearly defined, we can
</I>&gt;<i> implement a different layer of messaging for LL servers using LLSD
</I>&gt;<i> instead of remoting. That is, assuming LL is vaguely interested in the
</I>&gt;<i> non-centralized, hypergrid model of VWs.
