</I>&gt;<i> Charles, I strongly believe it would be better for us to see this mature a little as an external module first, rather

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>+1 on Justin's -1 :-)
There's no way I would propose the code as is today for a core patch; 
there's a lot stuff that is still loose.
But I hope people will want the hypergrid model enough that the 
extensions will be delivered on the same &quot;package&quot; as the core, soon.
And I hope there are volunteers from the core developers to help bring 
this up to speed!

&gt;<i> There is also an argument that such modules should eventually be outside the core anyway.  The OGP modules we have are 
</I>&gt;<i> in there because our region infrastructure module isn't advanced enough to make it easy to host these outside of core. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is something we should address (either having some protocol modules in or having them all out).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>+1 on that too. The hypergrid extension would be even simpler than what 
already is if only I could define externally what the comm module is. I 
suspect OGP suffers from the same problem.

&gt;<i> That's not to say that this isn't very interesting work, Cristina.  Does the code fit into the module structure?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes. As I said, the only weirdness comes because I can't spec the comms 
module. If you change that, it will be a charm (modulo some visibility 
changes here and there).
&gt;<i> I had thoughts along similar lines for distributed grids.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> but I never actually implemented anything = so fair do's to Cristina.  Also, my thoughts were to conduct everything 
</I>&gt;<i> client side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem does some with asset and inventory and routing this information around.  My thinking was that it would be 
</I>&gt;<i> better if the client fetch this information directly rather than via the sim, but this would require extensive (and 
</I>&gt;<i> probably difficult) client changes.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>A smarter client would make a lot of things a lot easier...
