Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Does OpenSim need to leave so many packets marked as reliable?

Guys,

for some time now, I've been meaning to propose a quite different approach, of which we've actually already done some tests with good result;

the basic idea is to connect reliable packets with two delegates; an ack delegate and a nack delegate - the implication probably obvious:

when the packet gets acked, the ack delegate is called, when it's nacked, the nack. The packet is sent as a parameter.

what this would let us do, is to use the sent packet to figure out what the right course of action is;

for an update, for example, we could look that object up and see if it's there's been another more resent update sent; if so, we can discard this. If not - we can _recreate_ a more recent packet and send that instead.

We have done something similar for terrain, a terrain packet watchdog, which keeps track of what patches has been acked, and resends those that haven't after a timeout. This removes the atom bombing.

Best regards,
Stefan Andersson

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it's possible that the situation is more complicated than simply marking all packets as reliable. It's also
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to look at percentages since it does depends heavily on what you do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, apologies for suggesting I would change trunk earlier. I won't be making any changes there without more
</I>&gt;<i> consultation, at least certainly not any change which is non-default. I forgot how complicated an area this is.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hi there,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; A vast number of the packets that we send out from OpenSim (usually &gt;95% according to the statistics printed to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Linden viewer log on shutdown) are marked as reliable. This requires that the viewer respond with an ack, and it just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; doesn't appear that this is done very well when a large number of reliables are sent. A lot of acks never come and we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; often appear to end up resending thousands (or in the worst case tens of thousands) of packets.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In a private experiment I've set Header.Reliable = false for the LayerDataPacket and ObjectUpdatePacket (which appear to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; be the greatest sent by count, and which are currently reliable by default in libOMV). Naturally, this cuts down the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; vast number of resends (and possibly some of the packet_out_of_order messages that come out on the console log) without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; any apparant ill effects. However, my testing has been pretty limited so I'm minded to wait until Monday before making
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; any trunk changes, since then I can get a better load test with multiple avatars (this doesn't stop anybody else testing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of course :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Any opinions on this? Is there a good reason for these packets to remain reliable (when resends are probably rare
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; anyway)? libOMV appears to mark every packet as reliable by default... and then OpenSim removes this from a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; them but not from others.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
