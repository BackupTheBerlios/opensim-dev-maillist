<PRE>A big table with &quot;We're handling this fully / Partially Handling / Not Handling&quot; might be useful if someone can do the organising.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Small but important things

This actually brings up a very interesting point. We have a quite a number of packets we are not sending or not processing or both.

As a project focus, as we did with the LSL functions, it seems reasonable to request packet handling patches for individual packet handlers just like we did with the LSL functions. We can make progress on some of these other things that are non-functional in a similar way.

Seconding this comment here, and adding - the best way to get those features/fixes in would be to:


-          Diagnose why that happens, and what we can send to get that to stop happening - on a technical level that is.
For instance, Clouds aren't sent because we don't send CloudData/LayerData packets to the viewer, we don't send these because we don't know how that format works exactly. Someone with viewer access (who isn't patching OpenSim, see licensing.) might be able to help here.

-          As far as I can tell, everything on that list is pretty much falling into the category of either us not sending a packet to the viewer that's expected, or we're not processing a packet that's sent to us. Getting handy with SLProxy  and capturing some samples of the packets you think are required and putting them into the mantis tracker would probably be a good start if you can't analyse them yourself.

Regards,

Adam

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Small but important things

I don't think the items you listed were being ignored on purpose. There are several factors at stake which could influence the order in which mantis items receive attention. There are few developers for OpenSimulator and many of them are uncompensated for their efforts and can only work on it as time permits. Many of these developers do not consider OpenSimulator to be a perfect clone of the SL server, but have other applications they are working towards. There are a few developers who are striving for a close match and they may be quite busy at times. This can often be at odds with a growing user community that has expectations for a free SL server clone. Another thing to consider is the state of development of OpenSimulator, which is quite early and there are many large pieces that need a lot of work before the final touches can be addressed. Often the user community will submit patches for their favorite features that the core developers haven't had time or resources to work on yet, and these are usually accepted along with a measure of gratitude. If the patches cannot be accepted the reasons are communicated with the submitter(s) who can then modify and resubmit them if they so choose.

I suggest a more suitable means to bring attention to your items would be to attach notes with additional observations or implementation suggestions to the original issue entries. This would make them appear at the top of the list again and raise developer attention. Use of this mailing list would be more suited to discussion of implementation details rather than item priority.

Over the time I noticed and reported many small and apparently unimportant missing features and implementations in Opensim. They haven't been looked at pretty much however, probably due to being considered too small compared to bigger issues. They're mainly about some things and features I initially found simple but who's effects (or rather absence) is noticeble in-world. I thought it might be fun and helpful to make a list with them and send it here, so maybe they can be re-checked and if someone knows they might get implemented easily. So this is my list of tiny things:

- <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=428">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=428</A> - Effects not showing while having a prim selected: When you keep a prim selected on the LL grid you have particles flowing from your hand to that prim, but on OS that doesn't happen.

- <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=2071">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=2071</A> - No footstep and collision sound: Although you do hear footsteps when you walk on terrain if a sound for them was loaded, none are heard when walking over prims. Also, if you bump into a prim no sounds are heard either nor if a physical prim hits something.

- <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=964">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=964</A> - Classic clouds not rendered: The classic particle clouds are not rendered in Opensim when that option is enabled from the Environment Editor.

- <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1028">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1028</A> - Script saving notifications don't work: When someone saves a script, the &quot;Compile successful, saving...&quot; and &quot;Save complete&quot; messages should appear in the lower field of the script editor window (the 2nd place right before the area where you edit the script itself) where script errors are also printed out. Currently there is a &quot;Compile successful&quot; popup but normally these messages should be displayed in that field like on the LL grid.

- <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=946">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=946</A> - Avatar jumps / crouches in the direction it faces: Movement in Opensim isn't implemented correctly and an avatar always attempts to go in the direction the camera faces. If you look up and press the &quot;walk forward&quot; key, the avatar jumps up rather then walking forward because you're looking up, which is not normal and mouselook must only consider the X and Y axes orientation when walking towards where the camera faces (does not apply while flying however as there you do move up and down too).

- <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1487">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1487</A> - &quot;Go here&quot; doesn't work correctly: Last I checked the Go Here command in the pie menu was not correctly implemented and didn't work, causing the avatar to walk infinitely towards a certain direction other then the chosen spot. Sit here works and auto-walks you to the point you clicked on, so Go Here can do the same thing just without sitting once you get there.

- <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1125">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1125</A> - Drop doesn't work for attachment: Another tiny command that's been missed... an attachment cannot be dropped to the ground with that command (at least last time I checked).

- <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1408">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1408</A> &amp; <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1407">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1407</A> - Terrain textures &amp; Grass realign at every startup session: Every time you restart a region the terrain textures and bits of grass realign in different positions. Normally this is very unimportant, but those who want things to be precise might be bothered by this. Sometimes for example there's green grass on a hill then after you restart the simulator that hill is covered in dirt because terrain Texture 1 and terrain Texture 2 blended differently around that height range.

I found these small issues but which may have an important impact on in-world experience (at least the first 5). So I just thought to point them here in a single email and maybe someone can check them and implement at least a few of them soon if they can be done :)
