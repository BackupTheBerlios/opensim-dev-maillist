<PRE>Guys,
 
for some time now, I've been meaning to propose a quite different approach, of which we've actually already done some tests with good result;
 
the basic idea is to connect reliable packets with two delegates; an ack delegate and a nack delegate - the implication probably obvious:
 
when the packet gets acked, the ack delegate is called, when it's nacked, the nack. The packet is sent as a parameter.
 
what this would let us do, is to use the sent packet to figure out what the right course of action is;
 
for an update, for example, we could look that object up and see if it's there's been another more resent update sent; if so, we can discard this. If not - we can _recreate_ a more recent packet and send that instead.
 
We have done something similar for terrain, a terrain packet watchdog, which keeps track of what patches has been acked, and resends those that haven't after a timeout. This removes the atom bombing.Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A>

It's also &gt; difficult to look at percentages since it does depends heavily on what you do.&gt; &gt; Also, apologies for suggesting I would change trunk earlier. I won't be making any changes there without more &gt; consultation, at least certainly not any change which is non-default. I forgot how complicated an area this is.&gt; &gt; &gt; Melanie wrote:&gt; &gt; Hi again,&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there may be some object updates that can be sent unreliable. For &gt; &gt; instance, all that have to do with moving objects (e.g. velocity != &gt; &gt; 0). but the initial object update can't be lost. Any object update &gt; &gt; lost of the login burst is a ghost prim.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Melanie&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Justin Clark-Casey wrote:&gt; &gt;&gt; Hmm, I then did the obvious thing and compared it (unscientifically) with a couple of sessions on the Linden Lab grid. &gt; &gt;&gt; There, reliable packets appear to compromise approximately 40% of the transfer.&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -------- Original Message --------&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Does OpenSim need to leave so many packets marked as reliable?&gt; &gt;&gt; Date: Thu, 02 Oct 2008 19:32:57 +0100&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Justin Clark-Casey &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">jjustincc at googlemail.com</A>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi there,&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; A vast number of the packets that we send out from OpenSim (usually &gt;95% according to the statistics printed to the&gt; &gt;&gt; Linden viewer log on shutdown) are marked as reliable. This requires that the viewer respond with an ack, and it just&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn't appear that this is done very well when a large number of reliables are sent. A lot of acks never come and we&gt; &gt;&gt; often appear to end up resending thousands (or in the worst case tens of thousands) of packets.&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In a private experiment I've set Header.Reliable = false for the LayerDataPacket and ObjectUpdatePacket (which appear to&gt; &gt;&gt; be the greatest sent by count, and which are currently reliable by default in libOMV). Naturally, this cuts down the&gt; &gt;&gt; vast number of resends (and possibly some of the packet_out_of_order messages that come out on the console log) without&gt; &gt;&gt; any apparant ill effects. However, my testing has been pretty limited so I'm minded to wait until Monday before making&gt; &gt;&gt; any trunk changes, since then I can get a better load test with multiple avatars (this doesn't stop anybody else testing&gt; &gt;&gt; of course :-)&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Any opinions on this? Is there a good reason for these packets to remain reliable (when resends are probably rare&gt; &gt;&gt; anyway)? libOMV appears to mark every packet as reliable by default... and then OpenSim removes this from a couple of&gt; &gt;&gt; them but not from others.&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; &gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; &gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; &gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- &gt; justincc&gt; Justin Clark-Casey&gt; <A HREF="http://justincc.wordpress.com">http://justincc.wordpress.com</A>&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
