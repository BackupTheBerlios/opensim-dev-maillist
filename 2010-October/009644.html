<PRE>I see the OS Grid folks are planning the move to 0.7 and HG1.5 which 
is great news.

I noted that their installed version will include MOAP so must be 
from the dev branch rather than the stable 0.7.0.2 release.

I wonder if the dev path is considered stable enough now that a new 
0.7.1 version can be tagged to include the recent improvements with 
MOAP, etc?  This would help those of us who try to follow the stable 
releases to get onto the versions with these important features and 
help in link ups on HG1.5.

Are we changing the MySWQL ddll library version back to the one that 
caused the problems in th transitions when we first went to 0.7?  I 
assume the time out we were getting could still be a problem... and 
hope the OSGrid folks have noted that issue if they use a version 
from the dev path rather than the 0.7.0.x ones which still include 
the old MySQL dll.  That was our biggest problem and need to roll 
back and transition manually with teh very first 0.7 version... 
0.7.0.1 and 0.7.0.2 fixed that by reverting the .dll you will recall.
