</I>
I ran a 4 region opensim system on an Amazon small instance for some time without issues.  (1 amazon compute unit and not much more that 1GB ram) on ubuntu.  Linux is everywhere in the cloud.  It also is run all the way from tiny embedded systems to some of the largest servers that exist.  

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> But consider first, the advantage of connection speeds that would be available to Second Life with Microsoft as the owner.
</I>
MS is not known for great server farms.  Many of their major server farms do not run MS. 

&gt;<i>   Right now Linden Labs has been building server centers and their fiber &#8220;LL Net&#8221;.  Now Micorosft walks in. Here&#8217;s 400x the server power with datacenters in many states, and 10000x the bandwidth around the world. Tada! Lag time between client and server gone, especially with international users.
</I>
Did the customers pipes suddenly get bigger?

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft also has the assets to help the education sector, which has been having more and more trouble staying with Second Life because of a lack of support.
</I>
But why would they be interested?

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> So, don&#8217;t just write it off because of the OS. Remember the other assets they have, like internet connections and good management skills.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>
I am not impressed with MS products and certainly not with their lock in and predatory practices.  I will be one of the ones attempting to build/use OpenSim alternatives if this deal goes through.
