<PRE>Adam ping!
How's the SOG/SOP refactor coming along? This is coming very close to 
the need for the refactoring...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm pulling my hair here with the serialization of scene objects. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is horrible! Using .Net serialization for something as important as this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is the worst idea ever. We're completely frozen. I'm trying to add an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional field for the creator info, and I'm stuck in all sorts of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ways: I can't compute the value of that field at serialization-time, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then there are the issues of compatibility with previous versions of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SOP class.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd like to understand all the implications of doing an entirely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different serialization procedure, one that does not use reflection, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that allows for processing-during-serialization. What will break, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> therefore needs fixing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Grovelling back through the archives, I found the e-mail where I
</I>&gt;<i> proposed this very thing back in June 2009!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And here's the old patch which partially implemented write.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you wrote later, some equivalent code was later put in libOMV, though
</I>&gt;<i> I would test it carefully (at the time I vaguely recall thinking that it
</I>&gt;<i> didn't deal with some serialization cases, but this may well have been
</I>&gt;<i> addressed).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not excited about whether this code remains in libOMV or is placed
</I>&gt;<i> in OpenSim if it's going to act as a legacy format in some way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I recall, there are no implications of doing this manually as
</I>&gt;<i> long as the XML ends up being the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I understand all archiving related to previous versions will break, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we need to keep supporting the existing serialization 'disease' for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> foreseeable future. I also understand that TPs/crossings between sims
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that talk different SOG serializations will break, but that's not so bad.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the SOG serialization is going to change in an incompatible manner, I
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely need to bump the OAR/IAR version numbers at the same time in
</I>&gt;<i> order to maintain confidence in the archiving. I also need to write the
</I>&gt;<i> code to stop old OpenSims trying to load these new versions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please can we co-ordinate this in a branch?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anything else I should be aware of before I go off and redo this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although .net auto-serialization is fatal if you want to make type
</I>&gt;<i> changes to existing fields, it has been very convenient for adding new
</I>&gt;<i> fields, since extraneous xml elements are simply ignored on
</I>&gt;<i> deserialization. I think it's almost essential that a new format behave
</I>&gt;<i> in the same way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, are you going to put version numbers in the new serializations so
</I>&gt;<i> that any future incompatible can be dealt with in some manner?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it worth considering whether other virtual environments might store
</I>&gt;<i> completely different object serializations?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For any new format, I agree with Dahlia in that something OSD-like may
</I>&gt;<i> be worth looking at, perhaps just a simple map as I was considering for
</I>&gt;<i> the 'dynamic attributes' in SOP. In fact, this could allow that to fit
</I>&gt;<i> in nicely.
