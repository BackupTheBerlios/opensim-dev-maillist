<PRE>Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'&#7743; all for streamlining this.

&gt;<i> all the assets generated as baked textures are marked temporary. i know
</I>&gt;<i> we have a cleaner that removes temp assets from the database periodically.
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't really create much load and very easy to clean up. we are
</I>&gt;<i> experimenting
</I>&gt;<i> with other geographical caches that help as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> that being said... i was planning to make it a configurable option (just
</I>&gt;<i> sets
</I>&gt;<i> the value of &quot;local&quot; field in caps.cs where the baked texture is uploaded.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I know that, in my grid, I would never want baked textures in my
asset server at all. It's fine as an option, so I have the option of
preventing the storage of these textures on my systems.

&gt;<i> the could be.. but the setup costs caused by ACD are high already. the real
</I>&gt;<i> point here
</I>&gt;<i> is to re-use that already cached appearance assets (cached in the viewers
</I>&gt;<i> of the avatars already in a region). rebaking or moving the assets from
</I>&gt;<i> simulator to simulator doesn't really help much with that. its the same
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth whether the client uploads the textures (they don't get
</I>&gt;<i> rebaked just re-uploaded)  or whether they come through agentcircuitdata.
</I>&gt;<i> and what we're trying to do is to take advantage of them already being
</I>&gt;<i> in the cache (so passing them through agentcircuitdata will hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> be a waste of time in most cases).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I suppose it would make ACD rather large. Maybe it's not such a good
idea.

&gt;&gt;<i> The avatar appearance (avatar service) is a name-value pair storage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyway, so it could easily hold the UUIDs of baked textures along
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the components of the avatar appearance. It could also hold the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> visual params, the question there is to what degree that is useful.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the encoding i have right now is one string (OSDMap) for all of the
</I>&gt;<i> appearance
</I>&gt;<i> assets. when i looked at the userdata code, i think every field/value pair
</I>&gt;<i> generates
</I>&gt;<i> a separate database update. and given that the appearance gets re-saved for
</I>&gt;<i> every attachment right now (that is, on login the attachments module forces
</I>&gt;<i> a save of the appearance once for each attachment even for attachments that
</I>&gt;<i> are already in the appearance data) that seemed like a lot of db writes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> could you expand the size of the string value that can be stored to medium
</I>&gt;<i> string?
</I>&gt;<i> that would be enough size to handle the encoding i'm using.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Having one row for each item is highly desirable, as it is easy to,
for instance, programmatically detach a single attachment, or unwear
a single wearable, like through a website. Storing the entire
appearance in one OSD is not what we would want. The overhead of
rewriting 27 rows is negligible in such a small table.

&gt;<i> i'm going to move my dev onto a github repository. i'll send the link when
</I>&gt;<i> thats done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Great, thanks.

Melanie
