<PRE>Somehow he has me thinking that he wants to errect some sort of apparatus like a Gridlatic Grand Central Station that is in a spherical shape that has thousands of openings, each a different geometric shape per grid. And also has an immense polyhedron construct dappled with thousands of transmitters listening for HyperGrid requests to transport in avatars in dodecs from various grids via wormholes and send them to other grids the same way.

And on top of that, have participating grids errect on a single sim another some sort of apparatus similar to The Machine that generates the wormhole from the Contact film, and drops an avatar in a dodec into the wormhole that connects to the Gridlatic Grand Central Station.

All this to see what grids would take the first step here and in time would take another, let alone uncertain how much prims, lsl, and c# coding it would take.

  Maybe I'm missing something, but what you're describing is how the Hypergrid works, redirect and all. It's not an http redirect, because the viewer doesn't do that protocol, but it's TeleportFinish, which is the Linden equivalent of an http redirect.

  If you use the link-region console command you place a region on your map (you see it on your map) that belongs to another grid.
