<PRE>Hi,

first off, we need the &quot;ruth&quot;, not just for new users, but also for
re-ruthing in the case of stuck attachments, etc. An avatar without
any clothing resources simply can't be a cloud.
Also, that would take care of viewers that don't send all of the
items, or don't send them late.

There already is a functionality to create user appearances and
inventories in RemoteAdmin.

I'm -1 on making a default appearance a default behavior, because
all grids have web interfaces that do this, and adding this as a
default would break them.

As a configurable option, of course, I'm all for it. It would have
to be a function of either the user server or the login server to
trigger it, and the code itself would need to reside in the
inventory server.

&gt;<i> I would be more for allowing grid owners and users to select a default

</I>&gt;<i> to be that when one logged into SL the first time, it asked if you 
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to be male or female, and gave you a default avatar from the 
</I>&gt;<i> Library based on that choice.  This allowed LL to include a newbie 
</I>&gt;<i> introduction HUD that guided users through the process of learning the 
</I>&gt;<i> controls of SL.  Other grids may wish to have that functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I propose is having a Library/Clothing/Defaults/ folder, each 
</I>&gt;<i> containing a folder with a default avatar and, optionally, a 96x96px 
</I>&gt;<i> preview texture.  Then, when a viewer first connects, they can select 
</I>&gt;<i> from these default avatars.  So on one grid, a selection of Male/Female 
</I>&gt;<i> humans and robots is available, whereas on a primarily furry grid, a 
</I>&gt;<i> selection of default furry avs can be selected.  These folders can be 
</I>&gt;<i> set up via a config file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, for the short-term, and for compatibility with non-TPV viewers, 
</I>&gt;<i> the following outfit folders need to be accessible so they can load 
</I>&gt;<i> their initial outfits:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> const std::string MALE_OUTFIT_FOLDER = &quot;Male Shape &amp; Outfit&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> const std::string FEMALE_OUTFIT_FOLDER = &quot;Female Shape &amp; Outfit&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As we know, Linden Viewer 1 contains a default avatar - &quot;Ruth&quot; - that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is used if no body parts are worn.  This means that a new user in a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fresh OpenSim standalone always starts off with some avatar.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, Linden Viewer 2 doesn't contain a default avatar.  Thus, a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new user appears as mist until they create and wear all four body 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parts (shape, skin, hair, eyes).  And even then, they're naked until 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they were both upper and lower clothing.  This has already caused some 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> confusion for new OpenSim server users.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are there objections to bundling a &quot;Ruth&quot; with OpenSim to maintain the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> newbie OpenSim server experience?  This avatar would closely replicate 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ruth in order to avoid favoring any particular application or content 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> creator.  The option to create the default body part/clothing could be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> turned off by default, only being turned on in OpenSim binary download 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packages.
