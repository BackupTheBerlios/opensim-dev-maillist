</I>Oh, I do, and I shall.  I managed a Windows Server 2003-based Active 
Directory network for the City, and then had my own Win Serv 2003 Active 
Directory network at home while first setting up my application hosting 
service.  Despite having a hardware firewall and allowing automatic 
updates, I had to clear out worms every 3 weeks and was on the edge of 
buying more RAM.  I have since switched to Linux-based hosting and have 
never looked back.

And I have successfully run OpenSim on three 1GB RAM Pentium 4 @ 
3.0GHz.  I ran two regions each, yes, but sacrificing quantity for 
quality is a lot cheaper than shelling out for new servers.
