The major thing holding me back from proposing that we start the 0.7.1 process (apart from lack of time) is the fact 
that newly created avatars can never have their appearance changed from viewer 2 instance, since they lack the core set 
of body parts/clothing and viewer 2 does not provide a Ruth/default avatar.

Personally, I would like to see this addressed before a 0.7.1 release.  I actually hope to take a look at it soon-ish. 
Alternatively, a release could be branched and then the issue addressed, particularly if there are any major changes for 
master on the horizon.  We seem to be in reasonable shape at the moment.

Yes, either the problem will be fixed or the library will be reverted for 0.7.1.  I hear that the OSGrid distro out 
shortly may replace that master dll with the old one, even though it will be based off the master branch (and hence 
contain moap).
