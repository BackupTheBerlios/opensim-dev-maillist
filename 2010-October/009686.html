<PRE>?.02 worth,

When Avatars table gets dorked re-ruthing is a must or delete the account 
and listen to the moaning . Would be nice if the user had a 'ruth me' 
button.
A default dressed action would be a bad move. D2 has it right, default 
choices but not behavior.

Hi,

first off, we need the &quot;ruth&quot;, not just for new users, but also for
re-ruthing in the case of stuck attachments, etc. An avatar without
any clothing resources simply can't be a cloud.
Also, that would take care of viewers that don't send all of the
items, or don't send them late.

There already is a functionality to create user appearances and
inventories in RemoteAdmin.

I'm -1 on making a default appearance a default behavior, because
all grids have web interfaces that do this, and adding this as a
default would break them.

As a configurable option, of course, I'm all for it. It would have
to be a function of either the user server or the login server to
trigger it, and the code itself would need to reside in the
inventory server.

</I>&gt;<i> What I propose is having a Library/Clothing/Defaults/ folder, each

</I>&gt;<i> humans and robots is available, whereas on a primarily furry grid, a
</I>&gt;<i> selection of default furry avs can be selected.  These folders can be
</I>&gt;<i> set up via a config file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, for the short-term, and for compatibility with non-TPV viewers,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> const std::string MALE_OUTFIT_FOLDER = &quot;Male Shape &amp; Outfit&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> const std::string FEMALE_OUTFIT_FOLDER = &quot;Female Shape &amp; Outfit&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As we know, Linden Viewer 1 contains a default avatar - &quot;Ruth&quot; - that

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, Linden Viewer 2 doesn't contain a default avatar.  Thus, a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parts (shape, skin, hair, eyes).  And even then, they're naked until
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they were both upper and lower clothing.  This has already caused some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> confusion for new OpenSim server users.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are there objections to bundling a &quot;Ruth&quot; with OpenSim to maintain the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> newbie OpenSim server experience?  This avatar would closely replicate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ruth in order to avoid favoring any particular application or content

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> turned off by default, only being turned on in OpenSim binary download
