<PRE>In January I traveled to London for a meetup with the UK crowd, and I can
assure you that everyone is committed to producing a solid, comprehensive
virtual world experience.

The project embraces many differing views as to just what the details of
that experience should be - and certainly the order in which those details
will be realized.

As an open project - and one that embraces addons, forks, distributions,
etc. - direction and thrust are localized in different sub-sections so that
the trajectory of the project as a whole feels a little sluggish (even
aimless) much of the time.  Still, we do make steady progress with good
humor, confidence and dedication.

I suggest reading through at least 100 editions of this listserve before
speaking in any but the most measured, temperate voice.  Lots of folks are
here doing the Lord's work, and I think we should all be grateful for the
contributions - of all sorts, including code and questions and testing and
prodding - that show up in such an extended review.

For my own part, I appreciate all those whose efforts initiated and advanced
this project.  My personal vision and plans are divergent, but this seems to
be a very good base from which to diverge - and a good group within which to
work.

========

Melanie only brushes up against the truth in that last post. The fact is,
this is an open list, and detractors and other haters have equal opportunity
to reply to our topics (and occasionally do).

As a general rule, feel free to ignore those at the extreme ends of the
expression spectrum ;)

Cheers and Thanks for your interest in helping out :)
