<PRE>I think this module has basically self deprecated itself because no one is
maintaining it, it was not really planned but someone needs to step up and
maintain it, something most of the current core developers are just to busy
to do right now, so if someone can step up and get it working it will
certainly not be removed.  As far as Vivox goes, i suspect they no longer
have any interest in OpenSimulator, you basically would need to buy a like
20,000 user license which is not cheap.  OSgrid and others have tried to
contact Vivox on many occasions and have gotten no response from them in the
past year.    OSgrids testing of Vivox ended about 6 months ago when they
shut our account off without warning or explanation, we are still waiting to
hear from them why they did this.

</I>&gt;<i> instructions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, the question is what is to be the voice solution or solutions that can

</I>&gt;<i> voice is clearly an essential feature?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know others have set up Vivox which provides high causality voice
</I>&gt;<i> facilities... but I have not investigated what the costs would be, or more
</I>&gt;<i> realistically for man Opensim community userrs, if there is a non-commercial
</I>&gt;<i> offering that can be used via Vivox?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if another open source and high quality voice solution should be
</I>&gt;<i> the bass from people's experience?  opensim-users may be the better place to
</I>&gt;<i> discuss that as the user base there might be wider than opensim-dev... hence
</I>&gt;<i> also posted to that list. Suggest a rely to users only please as most dev
</I>&gt;<i> folks see users too.
