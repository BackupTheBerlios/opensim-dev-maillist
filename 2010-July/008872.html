<PRE>Hi Rob,

I suspect the principles which allow the 6 month rule probably also allow an exemption to that rule (I would be surprised if they didn't.); but I would want to hear from legal advice before we could make any adjustments to the contributor agreement.

Regards,

Adam

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is my hope in the next 6-9 months to be in a position where I'll be
</I>&gt;<i> able to start making real contributions to OpenSim.  There are some
</I>&gt;<i> things I have to work out -- I have to make sure that the IP policies
</I>&gt;<i> of the Unviersity where I'm going won't create problems.  However,
</I>&gt;<i> there's another issue:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   You have not witnessed, seen or been party to the development of the
</I>&gt;<i>   official Linden Lab Server Software. If you have been involved in the
</I>&gt;<i>   official server development your contributions may affect the
</I>&gt;<i>   licensing of the main codebase and we cannot accept the contributions
</I>&gt;<i>   without a waiver from Linden Lab disclaiming any interest in your
</I>&gt;<i>   contributions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, I did see a bunch of that, way back when.  The part that I
</I>&gt;<i> actively worked on myself was something that has no analog in OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> (the &quot;region conductor&quot;, which dealt with figuring out which servers
</I>&gt;<i> ran which regions).  And, it's been more than a year -- will likely
</I>&gt;<i> have been more than 18 months by the time I'm in a position where I'll
</I>&gt;<i> be able to start making contributions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Six or eight months ago, I made some preliminary investigations into
</I>&gt;<i> getting this sort of waiver, asking somebody who was most likely to be
</I>&gt;<i> sympathetic to the need for it, and indications are that such a waiver
</I>&gt;<i> is probably very difficult to get.  I honestly do not believe that
</I>&gt;<i> Linden would want to sign such a thing.  However, I also don't think
</I>&gt;<i> that they should have to.  It's been long enough since I had access to
</I>&gt;<i> that code that there's no practical way I can steal any of it at this
</I>&gt;<i> point.  Would it be possible to have some sort of timeout (say, 18
</I>&gt;<i> months) added to this clause in the contributor agreement?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If that can't be done, then if I want to work on OpenSim I'm
</I>&gt;<i> effectively going to have to make my own fork of it.  I know I'll want
</I>&gt;<i> to be working on things related to the Physics engine, and it would be
</I>&gt;<i> sad to me if I were not able to contribute what I did back to core
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.  It would greatly undermine the value of what I hope to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to do in the future.
