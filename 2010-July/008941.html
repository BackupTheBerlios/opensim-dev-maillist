<PRE>[I seem to be getting messages lost or delayed.  Sorry if this 
appears twice folks]

Let me put this in an e-mail until I can report it in Mantis... in 
case someone knows what the issue is and can correct it in time for a 
proper 0.7 release.  And to have somewhere to keep the notes.

We have a working 0.7 (SVN 13220) Robust.exe and Opensim.exe setup 
running some regions on one host.  I recently added a second host 
that just runs Opensim.exe connecting to the original setup for its 
ROBUST Grid services.  Most things work fine.

But we notice that if we log off from a Viewer (SL 1.23.5) while the 
avatar is in the region hosted on the second server, then the FIRST 
server's Opensim.exe gives  an error &quot;Exception in poll service 
thread&quot;.  There are no error indications in the Opensim.exe log for 
the second machine running the region where the avatar was logged in. 
The regions being mentioned are adjacent ones to the position for the 
region on the second server in which the avatar was on logout.
