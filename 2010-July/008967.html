<PRE>Not everyone will tell you to fork off. Who is approachable should
be clear after reading the thread.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We have no clue what direction you are trying to head....

</I>&gt;<i> Just recently someone was asking for an OpenSim roadmap, and the
</I>&gt;<i> consensus was &quot;We don't really have one.&quot; Now we get people screaming
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;DON'T TREAD ON OUR ROADMAP!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The issues raised are certainly valid, and it's perfectly fine to say,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It's not as straightforward as you may think,&quot; but this type of
</I>&gt;<i> response is completely uncalled for.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been planning to invest a substantial amount of my own money in
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim, and would have been asking here how best to do it; apparently
</I>&gt;<i> the best advice in this thread is &quot;fork off&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Those people that actually paid money for a Facebook Clone are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably some of the dumbest people I've ever seen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. Diaspora isn't a &quot;Facebook clone&quot;. It's an entirely different
</I>&gt;<i> approach to social networking, and quite a good idea, I think.
