<PRE>Fractal generation doesn't have to be expensive. I've done some myself, 
in OpenSim.

This is my generated continent:
<A HREF="http://www.wizarth.com.au/gallery2/v/Game/WorldMap.png.html">http://www.wizarth.com.au/gallery2/v/Game/WorldMap.png.html</A>

The image is made using the same free noise generation lib as the 
in-OpenSim terrain (not imported as height maps, generated in a region 
module). Last time I booted it, it was as a 10x10 set of regions, but 
this turned out to be too small for what I want to do with it. In the 
same way, I could have this in a single region (but the resolution 
wouldn't do it justice).

Smart regions would be useful for my end goal for this, but as observed, 
there is a lot more work pending on this happening.
