<PRE>*&gt; perhaps, in a future, will be possible to build a *
*&gt; complet planet, a real scale*

Planets, galaxies and solar systems could probably all easily be rendered
using procedural generation.  Whole galaxies could be rendered (on-the-fly)
using procedural generation.

Planet terrain, star systems and a galaxy should/could all be easily created
using procedural generation.

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation</A>

Elite (by David Braben and Ian Bell back in 1984) was developed using
procedural generation.

It's quite common for modern games (such as Soldier of Fortune, or &quot;Just
Cause&quot;) to use procedural generation to create large and varied groups of
tropical islands (or other terrain).

Space flight sims often use procedural generation to develop whole planets,
terrain, and even galaxies.

I believe &quot;Elite&quot; (designed back in 1984) planned to contain 248 (approximately
282 trillion) galaxies with 256 solar systems each, and easily could have,
but they were afraid that such a gigantic universe would cause &quot;disbelief&quot;
by players.

So instead of 282 Trillion Galaxies, they settled on just 8 Galaxies.
 That's still plenty of space for you to travel around in.  ;-)

There are a lot of programs that use procedural generation.

SpeedTree is just one example of a &quot;middleware&quot; that is used to generate a
large variety of trees (procedurally).  Yet it's leaf textures are fetched
from regular files, thus creating &quot;high resolution&quot; real foliage.

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpeedTree">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpeedTree</A>

CityScape uses procedural generation and generates cities and terrain just
from GIS data:

CityScape supports GIS data import:

It can also do procedural Traffic Data generation:
<A HREF="http://pixelactive3d.com/Products/CityScape/?FeatureId=TrafficData">http://pixelactive3d.com/Products/CityScape/?FeatureId=TrafficData</A>

It's all possible... but we'd probably need thousands of developers just to
get OpenSim to do 'everything' that we'd like it to do.  ;-)

</I>&gt;<i>  There is a ton of interesting engineering challenges on the server side of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these systems. We haven't even begun to scratch the surface. As such, it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely unrealistic to expect things like what you describe to happen any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time soon -- at least for interactive, shared, immersive spaces;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-interactive, non-shared, non-immersive (like Google Earth) it's another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> matter. It's also fairly unrealistic to expect those kinds of optimizations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to happen spontaneously and for free. There needs to be a lot of money
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thrown in for those things to be prototyped and experimented with --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> research money, for starters; that's the kind of thing that will keep a lot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of graduate students busy for the next few years.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Running hundreds (or thousands) of IDLE regions require too many system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resources (RAM, CPU cycles, etc.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I believe that the basic server core (OpenSim) should eventually be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modified so that ALL regions should have a configurable &quot;timeout&quot; option
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> field (in the regions.ini file).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Configuring_Regions">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Configuring_Regions</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  That way an idle &quot;region timeout&quot; can be set (on a region per region
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> basis), and this would allow the OpenSim server to shut down idle regions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (based on the &quot;idle timeout&quot; configured in the regions.ini file).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  So if a region were completely empty for a particular number of minutes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (let's say a region were empty and idle for 5 minutes, then the idle region
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be shut down automatically after the set &quot;idle timeout&quot; period for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that particular region).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  This way idle (and empty) regions are not consuming valuable system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resources.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Then as a user attempts to &quot;teleport&quot; to an idle (empty) region, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server would simply start that idle region (on-the-fly) so that the user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could teleport into the idle region.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  It may create a little bit of a slight &quot;pause&quot; (as an idle region is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> started) while teleporting, but you normally experience a pause anyways
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while teleporting, so a few additional two or three seconds shouldn't make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that much of a difference when teleporting to an empty or idle region.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  A second improvement upon this, would be a &quot;smart idle regions&quot; grid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> option (configurable at the grid and/or region level).  The &quot;smart idle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regions&quot; grid option would take things one step further, and would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> automatically allow the configuration option to bring nearby idle regions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out of &quot;sleep&quot; mode, and start them automatically (if an avatar is within a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certain number of meters from a nearby neighboring region).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  For example this number could be configurable at the Grid and/or region
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> level to be anything from 1 meter, to 100 meters, or even 256 meters (thus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> automatically loading the idle region to the North, the idle region to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> South, the idle region to the East and the idle region to the West). So that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nearby regions could be loaded (as an avatar gets close to the border of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another nearby region).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  This way if avatars are using high speed vehicles (aircraft, boats,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trains, etc.) and they are getting close to a region crossing (to another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> region that may be idle) that region could automatically be started (if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;smart regions&quot; was enabled), thus making the region crossing seamless (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in real-time).  So that flight simulators and ship simulators could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developed (with large global high resolution land region maps of the whole
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world) that could easily be stored on any single server.  (The idle regions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would simply load &quot;on-demand&quot; as needed).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  This way OpenSim core could be used for Science, Educational,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Flight/Train/Ship simulation or even gaming purposes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  So that way an OpenSim/realXtend server could technically store
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thousands of regions all on a single server instance (possibly even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 50-60GB's of high resolution GIS/terrain/region maps of the whole world).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  So that things like high resolution &quot;Global Scenery&quot; could be created
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (and downloaded) under a &quot;Creative Commons&quot; license for high resolution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scenery (stored in Mega regions) for OpenSim.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.global-scenery.org/">http://www.global-scenery.org/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I do have a military GIS (Imagery Analysis/Intelligence) background, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't mind working on things like basic high resolution OpenSim/realXtend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> region content creation (empty regions based on high resolution GIS/DTED
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data).  DTED data could be used to create elevation maps, and high
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolution imagery could be used for terrain textures.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I believe an OpenSim GIS project would be a very good &quot;basis&quot; for other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects (educational, gaming, city planning, development, architectural
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development and multi-person Flight/Train/Ship simulation &amp; training
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development) since terrain/region modules would be available free for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> download.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  The reason &quot;Smart Regions&quot; (idle region timeouts) would be necessary, is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so things like modeling rural areas like &quot;Yellowstone&quot; National Park could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easily be possible on a small single server (or even a small single
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> workstation running a single OpenSim/osgrid/realXtend server instance),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since the majority of those regions would usually remain idle/empty (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the idle regions shutting down they would consume NO CPU clock cycles
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or RAM, thus making &quot;idle&quot; regions identical to idle web pages that take up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing more than hard drive space).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Certain regions (like a lobby, main Plaza, or high-traffic regions)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would need to remain active (no idle timeout) and would simply have a idle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> timeout value of &quot;9999&quot;.  (Which would equate to requiring the region to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely idle and empty for a minimum of 9999 minutes, or about 7 days)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before going into a &quot;sleep&quot; or idle &quot;shutdown&quot; mode.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I supposed a timeout value of &quot;0000&quot; could also be used for an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;infinite&quot; time (no idle timeout or idle shut down) so that regions that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to remain up (forever) with no idle timeout period or idle shutdown
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could thus stay running all the time (consuming valuable RAM, CPU and system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resources).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  But as we begin to look at global region mapping and developing large
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regions (especially from a GIS perspective) then we need to look at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;flaws&quot; in the current OpenSim server design architecture, and see that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would simply not be possible to create something like a virtual 3D world (on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a 1:1 virtual/GIS scale) without having billions of physical servers (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trillions of dollars for physical hardware, let alone the costs of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> electricity and hardware just to even run a single instance).  It seems to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a major flaw in the basic design architecture to require the &quot;always-on&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concept of regions without having a region &quot;idle-timeout&quot; feature.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Wasting RAM and CPU clock cycles on empty/idle regions (without having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an &quot;idle timeout&quot; option would seem like a huge waste of energy, and system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resources, especially when those valuable system resources could be better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spent on active regions with physical avatars that require the additional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> processing power and RAM that could be freed up by shutting down any idle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regions (after a specified &quot;time out&quot; period).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Since the majority of the regions would remain empty and idle on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server (similar to static web pages that are not being accessed or viewed on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a web server), it seems extremely foolish to waste such valuable system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resources (such as server CPU clock cycles and server RAM, let alone the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> energy/power) wasted on idle regions that remain empty and idle (but must be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> loaded as &quot;always on&quot;).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Having an &quot;on-the-fly&quot; system that will shut down idle regions (based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their configurable regions.ini &quot;time out&quot; value in the regions.ini file, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> automatically load idle regions &quot;on-the-fly&quot; would be much closer to the way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the current web is designed, so that servers can hold thousands (possibly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even millions) of web pages that consume no system resources (other than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> physical hard drive space) unless the web pages are being viewed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  By allowing regions to startup/shutdown dynamically (with a &quot;region
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> timeout&quot; feature) thus making servers able to hold infinite amounts of idle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regions/land (only limited by the amount of hard drive/disk storage space,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which could easily be expanded via RAID or SAN devices).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  System Administrators could put &quot;heavy load&quot; regions on separate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dedicated servers, while keeping other &quot;idle load&quot; regions all on the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server (for regions that are generally idle and not visited very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequently).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  As we evolve and slowly get into simulation systems, such as aircraft,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> train or ship simulators I can see how having large numbers of &quot;idle&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regions would be a requirement for realistic train/ship/aircraft simulation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and gaming (as well as GIS and global flight) and how it simply would not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even be possible to have millions of regions running all on a single server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (due to the current &quot;architectural&quot; problems with OpenSim).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  It just wouldn't even be possible to even create a simple flight, train
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or ship simulator using OpenSim (because OpenSim couldn't even store the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> image/region scenery maps).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Yet, a small simple &quot;X-Plane&quot; flight simulator can store high resolution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;global scenery&quot; data for the WHOLE world on just 6 or 7 double layer DVD's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (about 60+ GB of terrain data) all on a single workstation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.global-scenery.org/">http://www.global-scenery.org/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I don't mind starting a Global-Scenery package for OpenSim/realXtend and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do think it would be extremely nice to offer the community high resolution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> realistic regions (free of charge under a &quot;creative commons&quot; license).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  The problem with even starting a large content creation project, is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the current OpenSim architecture is unable to even use it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  It would be a complete waste of time and effort to have realistic global
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> high resolution terrain regions available for OpenSim to use for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Flight/Train/Ship (as well as Education &amp; Science) simulation but the whole
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea of a large scale GIS/terrain project for OpenSim/realXtend seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somewhat pointless since the current realXtend/OpenSim server architecture
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is not designed to currently even use/store thousands (or even millions) of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idle regions (and the current server architecture of keeping ALL idle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regions running is &quot;flawed&quot; by architectural design).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  It would seem to make much more sense (from an engineering standpoint)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to have the option to shut any idle regions down, and only leave active
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regions running (or at least give users/operators/grid owners the ability to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configure regions &amp; a grid to allow for idle region timeouts).  I believe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this &quot;region idle time out&quot; time should be configured in the regions.ini
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configuration file.  With an option of &quot;9999&quot; for a 7 day idle timeout and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;0000&quot; option to disable the idle timeout for a particular region (for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regions that don't ever want to shut down due to an idle timeout).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  It would make sense to see OpenSim/realXtend support a &quot;smart region&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> type of system which servers would/could be configured to shut idle regions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down by default (configurable in the regions.ini file for each region) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the server could load idle regions &quot;On-The-Fly&quot; freeing up valuable system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resources on a physical server.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  By implementing &quot;smart regions&quot; into the OpenSim core, a high resolution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> global GIS/terrain project would seem like a viable project to start (and I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wouldn't mind starting such a project) especially for future
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> science/flight/ship/train simulation.  I could probably find other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> universities (and sponsors) that would be willing to host mirror copies of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the empty raw .OAR global terrain region files.  So that other developers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> educators or users could freely download high resolution realistic region
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> terrains (for educational, gaming or simulation purposes).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  If OpenSim was able to shut down idle regions on the fly, then it could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be used for flight simulation, terrain simulation, or even realistic game
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simulation (could have large high resolution realistic global terrain maps).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I don't mind starting/doing free &quot;creative commons&quot; (attribution by)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based global GIS/terrain content creation work for the OpenSim/realXtend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community, but the current problem that I see is that the current OpenSim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> architecture design would NEVER even be able to support such a feature
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (since the current server architecture would require thousands, or millions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or possibly even billions of OpenSim servers just to handle ONE single copy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of &quot;the world&quot; terrain in high-res region data.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Thus making it completely impossible to ever &quot;sail a ship&quot; or &quot;fly an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aircraft&quot; around the world on a standalone OpenSim server.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I believe the basics of good simulation programs starts with high
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolution image maps (and scenery data).  A flight simulation program is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fairly useless without realistic global imagery.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Although the basic default high resolution terrain/region data would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably only consume about 50-60 GB's of storage space (empty terrain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regions stored in &quot;mega region&quot; OAR format), it would still be impossible to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even store or use the terrain region data on a single OpenSim server (since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an OpenSim server would require that all the regions be running at the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time, with no way to load/unload the regions (on-the-fly) as they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accessed or needed.  We would need to have an &quot;idle time-out&quot; feature and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also a &quot;load-on-demand&quot; feature to load regions and shut down idle regions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on a region &quot;idle time-out&quot; system (and to load nearby regions, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> load regions that users attempt to teleport to).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I apologize for sounding repetitive.
