<PRE>Just fyi, I've started implementing shared media/media on a prim in OpenSim on a git branch called moap.  It's not very 
functional right now since no data is persisted and most of the messages are not properly implemented.

However, a user can set a media texture, use it and then see it again after a relog (albeit after clicking the prim 
face).  Other avatars won't yet see anything.

As always, only try out this branch with data that you don't mind losing.  This will be particularly important when we 
start persisting the media texture metadata.

I hope to get a chance to work on this stuff over the next couple of days.  It's too late for it to be in 0.7 but that's 
just as well since it will need a bit of testing anyway.  As always, patches are welcome.

Many thanks to lkalif and the other guys on the libomv crew for their code and help - this is making implementation 
vastly easier than it would otherwise have been.
