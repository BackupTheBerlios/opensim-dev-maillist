Hi Justin, hi devs/testers,being aware this is a work-in-progress we would not filling any mantises unless you will ask, Justin.
We will try LSL methods for manipulating prim media, asking everyone to share them if implemented. (i will post a sharing link as soon as possible)
Because only sqlite persistance is implemented, i think is better for demo-server to unistall simiangrid and continuing tests with sqlite since you will notice any migrations. People want to test it can use Test-User-test (first-last-password), Test1-User-test. Test2-User-test...and so on ( i will register these avatars soon). If anyone needs an own avatar name please contact me so i can register it on opensim console.
About other modules, my goal is : a &quot;complete&quot; binary distribution (as diva and adam did) but really with all features available on opensim, i meant :Friends - groups - search - profiles - voice - frontend - offline messages - offline groupsmessages - moap - viewer and all other features needed for a competitive and really &quot;complete&quot; OS (asking u folks to suggest any features wanted in bin distribution).
I heard about &quot;fund-raising&quot; wanted : so we are a society working in fund raising (in italy) so we can organize a &quot;project&quot; for a &quot;complete&quot; OS bin distribution, raising funds for devs and testers (needs servers, job-time, etc...)
Central goal i meant : stop people thinking to &quot;opensource&quot; as a &quot;partial&quot; or &quot;amateur&quot; dev and giving a boost to a new opensimulator-dev &quot;look&quot; as professional and competitive. I heard about too many people talking about a &quot;blanket too short&quot; about opensim...but we know its not truth : we need only an implemented &quot;coordination&quot; on the project (this is a my opinion).
Finally, want ask to devs and testers to suggest a complete list of features wanted in a &quot;work-in-progress&quot; (for now) bin distro.
Ty all.Enrico Nirvana

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi there, talking with Ai Austin we decided to install a complete demo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of Justin's moap with a full installation of Simian Frontend so folks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can see the web on a prim dev.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here are the good news :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    1. Avatar appearance now works fine with Snowglobe 2.0.1 !!! This is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       because the Simian ships a default_assets folder pointed by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       demo installation of tonight ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Enrico.  Yes, I recently found out that appearance should work okay with version 2 viewers and OpenSim, though one 
</I>&gt;<i> needs to set up an outfit with all 4 body parts (shape, eyes, etc.) first - this can get rather fiddly.  Also, it 
</I>&gt;<i> appears that one needs an eye texture - otherwise the avatars have disconcertingly blank eyes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    2. You can register to the demo-MOAP here :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       <A HREF="http://95.110.224.250/GridFrontEnd/">http://95.110.224.250/GridFrontEnd/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    3. Download Snowglobe last release and login with loginuri
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       <A HREF="http://95.110.224.250/Grid/login/">http://95.110.224.250/Grid/login/</A> (note the trailing slash !!!)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    4. Current release is R13260. We will follow Justin's job everynight
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       and install the newest release.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    5. Join and test it hardly ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    6. In the next days we will try to install all scalable modules
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       (search, voice...etc) any help by devs for installation is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       appreciated;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    7. If any of u needs to load iar/oar to the demo server contact me
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Testing is welcome, though please remember that this is a work-in-progress so I would hold off from filing any mantises 
</I>&gt;<i> for now.  One thing you might want to try are the LSL methods for manipulating prim media - I've implemented these but 
</I>&gt;<i> not tested them yet so I wouldn't be surprised if they are broken.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So far, only sqlite persistence is implemented and the format of this might change, so please don't store anything of 
</I>&gt;<i> value since I won't be doing any migrations.  The major thing left to implement is the url whitelist (which annoyingly 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't appear to be documented and has no example scripts).  There are also some bugs to squash - for instance, drag 
</I>&gt;<i> and drop doesn't yet work because the viewer doesn't send out object media navigate messages in this circumstance 
</I>&gt;<i> (unlike the manual media texture setup).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Putting on other modules (search, voice, etc.) shouldn't be necessary unless you are also testing other things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ty again Justin and ty to all of u devs !!!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, always good to know the efforts are appreciated :)
</I>&gt;<i>
