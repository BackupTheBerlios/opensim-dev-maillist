<PRE>Hi Drew,
 
i was thinking the same just 1 month ago. I directly contacted Nebadon one
of the Devs (on OSGRID) about spending some
money for the physics engine. He told me that Funds are always welcome and
told me to ask the physics guru Revolution Smythe.
I had some nice conversation but as Nebadon said in the mail to this list,
most developers are also busy in the RL. 
But if you like we, together can mail Offlist and see what we can do on this
issue.
 
best regards
Wordfromthe Wise

Betreff: [Opensim-dev] OpenSim - What's Taking so long


Okay, that was my catchy title that in no way means any disrespect.  I love
OpenSim, have used it for years, tell everyone I meet about it and am a huge
fan and supporter.  Recently a question was asked about a roadmap and
progress.  I would like to expand on that.  OpenSim has now been around for
a while - like years.  Yet I can't really use it for clients.  So here is my
question.  As a non-coder, how can others help.  For example, I would gladly
donate some decent money if there were a coordinated fundraising event and a
plan to hire a couple of full-time, very qualified developers to really move
this along.
 
Please, please, please don't take this the wrong way.  This is NOT a
criticism.  I know this is done by volunteers and I know that this is more
ambitious than Second Life, but have we looked at other solutions to move
the process along.  I think there are a lot of people like me who would
contribute.  But, and I stress this.  Me donating say $1,000 by myself isn't
going to do anything.  We would need a serious fundraising drive, and
specific and talented people that we could hire full-time as
consultants/coders to really move this along.
 
I would imagine I am not the first to suggest this.  But every day I see
this awesome product I want to use, yet it seems months or years away from
stable wide-spread use.
 
There are now several web sites that help in fundraising.  I am sure many of
you read about the NYU students that raised several hundred thousand dollars
in a short time so they could spend their summer coding a Facebook clone
(sort of).  Now if 4 undergrads can get that kind of money for a Facebook
clone, why hasn't OpenSim tried something similar.  These fundraising sites
are hot right now - let's take advantage of them!

The article was written before they raised much more money.
