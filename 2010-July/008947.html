<PRE>Hi,

generally, there are two ways to go about advancing development of a
project. One can do it as a closed, or as an open project.

With an open project, this is rather easy. You simply compensate a
developer for their time to develop certain features of the program
and publish the source code under the project's license.

At that point, I would see no issue with using the name
OpenSimulator as a name to describe the project, provided it is not
used to appear to endorse a business venture or another product or
service.

With closed source, the use of the name should be limited to &quot;based
on OpenSimulator&quot; when describing the product. Further or more
extended use of the name would be frowned upon.

Developers here, myself included, have taken payment to provide
OpenSource code to the community. I am sure that you will find
receptive ears when asking for certain features and offering
compensation. I, myself, am not adverse to this.

Regards,

Melanie

</I>&gt;<i> would need some independent &quot;observer/accountant&quot; to make sure everything is
</I>&gt;<i> cool and the money spent wisely, but I know several that would volunteer
</I>&gt;<i> their time to do that (attorneys/accountants).  So if anyone else wants to
</I>&gt;<i> work on fundraising, etc., contact me at <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">drewehart at gmail.com.</A>  Or if anyone
</I>&gt;<i> has other ideas on how non-programmers can help the code move along, I am
</I>&gt;<i> open to anything.  Even if some of the experts want to hold some training
</I>&gt;<i> sessions so we can learn coding - though I am not sure if that is
</I>&gt;<i> practicable.  Thanks,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of the problems with OpenSimulator project doing this, is it is not an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> established company.  There is no central office or managers for this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project.  That aside if you wanted to try to raise funds to hire programmers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who will submit their code you could certainly do that, you do not need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator project to do this for you.  You could also ask some of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim developers directly if they are interested in working for bounty if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you can raise the funds.  Another problem right now is most of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers are way to busy to organize fund raising events, and from my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experience Money doesnt always solve problems, and can tend to complicate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things to the point they never actually get done, because once the funds run
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out work just flat out stops and is very difficult to get going again.   One
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing you do not mention is what you would like to see finished or what you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feel is missing or incomplete.  OpenSimulator is a very open ended project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and will likely always be morphing and changing, there will likely never be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an end to its development, unlike a facebook website which has very limited
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> purpose to its goals.  I am going to assume you mean Second Life
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compatibility, this is really just a small piece of opensimulator and I will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think that you will find that most of the people directly involved in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator are not that interested in recreating second life, there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many avenues being pursued right now that look nothing like Second Life, one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the major factors really holding this project back is the lack of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Open-Source viewer that the OpenSimulator developers can work on that is in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a usable state, the Second Life viewer source code is off limits to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator developers and because of this making OpenSimulator be second
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> life compatible is not always easy or even possible at all in some cases.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think once we see viewers like Realxtend Naali and others become more usable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you will see OpenSimulator move even further from trying to be a second life
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clone.  But these are just some of the reasons that I see OpenSimulator is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> taking as long as it has, and it will likely continue to take just as long
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no matter how much money you throw at it, but like i said, anyone who has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the desire can raise funds and hire developers to get involved and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contribute the code to this project, so please do not wait for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSimulator developers to do this for you, as some of the developers that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work for Intel Corp and IBM Corp, and others like Melanie and Justin have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been paid to develop and create patches as well as for profit grids like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Reaction Grid, so its not like this is really something that is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currently happening.  Hope this helps to explain atleast a little of why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things are the way they are.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Okay, that was my catchy title that in no way means any disrespect.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> love OpenSim, have used it for years, tell everyone I meet about it and am a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> huge fan and supporter.  Recently a question was asked about a roadmap and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> progress.  I would like to expand on that.  OpenSim has now been around for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a while - like years.  Yet I can't really use it for clients.  So here is my
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> question.  As a non-coder, how can others help.  For example, I would gladly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> donate some decent money if there were a coordinated fundraising event and a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> plan to hire a couple of full-time, very qualified developers to really move
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this along.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Please, please, please don't take this the wrong way.  This is NOT a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> criticism.  I know this is done by volunteers and I know that this is more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ambitious than Second Life, but have we looked at other solutions to move
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the process along.  I think there are a lot of people like me who would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> contribute.  But, and I stress this.  Me donating say $1,000 by myself isn't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> going to do anything.  We would need a serious fundraising drive, and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> specific and talented people that we could hire full-time as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> consultants/coders to really move this along.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I would imagine I am not the first to suggest this.  But every day I see
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this awesome product I want to use, yet it seems months or years away from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stable wide-spread use.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There are now several web sites that help in fundraising.  I am sure many
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of you read about the NYU students that raised several hundred thousand
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dollars in a short time so they could spend their summer coding a Facebook
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> clone (sort of).  Now if 4 undergrads can get that kind of money for a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Facebook clone, why hasn't OpenSim tried something similar.  These
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fundraising sites are hot right now - let's take advantage of them!
