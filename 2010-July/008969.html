<PRE>I completely agree with Enslar... this has been a terribly aggressive
response to an inquiry posted with the best of intentions.

If anyone is reading this thread, who had been thinking about getting
involved, or how they might contribute to OpenSim in some way, I wouldn't
blame them for thinking twice.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I think you're a bit confused as to what Open Simulator is (and what it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; isn't).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Seems pretty foolish.  Stupid people do stupid things.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If you're going to beat your drum, and try to conjur up money, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; at least screw your head on straight and try to get a grasp on what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; it is that you're trying to accomplish.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Holy cow, is this what people get for asking how they can help with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenSim? Drew came along, asking how non-coders can help, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; presented fundraising as one possibility, and gets suspicion,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hostility and downright insults.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; We have no clue what direction you are trying to head....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just recently someone was asking for an OpenSim roadmap, and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consensus was &quot;We don't really have one.&quot; Now we get people screaming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;DON'T TREAD ON OUR ROADMAP!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The issues raised are certainly valid, and it's perfectly fine to say,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;It's not as straightforward as you may think,&quot; but this type of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; response is completely uncalled for.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've been planning to invest a substantial amount of my own money in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenSim, and would have been asking here how best to do it; apparently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the best advice in this thread is &quot;fork off&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Those people that actually paid money for a Facebook Clone are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; probably some of the dumbest people I've ever seen.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; P.S. Diaspora isn't a &quot;Facebook clone&quot;. It's an entirely different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approach to social networking, and quite a good idea, I think.
