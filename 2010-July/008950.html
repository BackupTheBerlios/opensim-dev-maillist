<PRE>In my opinion, if someone funds open source development on
OpenSimulator, they can say they are funding OpenSimulator development.

I did EXCLUDE uses of the name to describe or promote/endorse
anything else.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to make sure everything is cool and the money spent wisely, but I know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> several that would volunteer their time to do that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (attorneys/accountants).  So if anyone else wants to work on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fundraising, etc., contact me at <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">drewehart at gmail.com</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">drewehart at gmail.com</A>&gt;.  Or if anyone has other ideas on how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-programmers can help the code move along, I am open to anything.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even if some of the experts want to hold some training sessions so we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can learn coding - though I am not sure if that is practicable.  Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry to start off heavy, but please could you not use the name &quot;OpenSimulator&quot; as part of any external project name.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> have to disagree with Melanie about this - I think that this has to apply to all projects whether commercial or not.  We 
</I>&gt;<i> need to avoid confusion about what is directly OpenSimulator - as far as I understand if we don't defend this name then 
</I>&gt;<i> anybody could start using it since we could not subsequently protect it as a trademark.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think there's any issue with using &quot;OpenSimulator&quot; in any support text.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that the comparison with Diaspora really applies.  Diaspora are starting from scratch with a set of 
</I>&gt;<i> friends who can create a structure that can easily handle funding.  OpenSim has been going for quite a while with a 
</I>&gt;<i> diverse set of developers with different interests where it becomes much harder to retrofit certain kinds of organization.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Diaspora are operating in a space with huge interest.  Virtual worlds/environments, though there obviously are 
</I>&gt;<i> passionate people involved (not least on this list) are very much less popular.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Diaspora, as Michael mentioned, are tackling a fairly well-defined problem, albeit in an innovative way.  Virtual 
</I>&gt;<i> environments servers, on the other hand, don't really solve a problem in themselves but provide a platform for doing 
</I>&gt;<i> lots of other diverse and interesting things, which I feel makes incorporating all these interests in a funded 
</I>&gt;<i> environment much harder.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, money brings with it organizational overhead.  You've already mentioned the need for independent 
</I>&gt;<i> observers/accountants and attorneys.  And when one starts employing developers directly the question becomes who sets 
</I>&gt;<i> their agenda and who decides who is employed.  This is why direct employment and bounties tend to be easier (though I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> not a great fan of bounties).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, if there really is money and interest out there, one thing that I would suggest is setting up a downstream 
</I>&gt;<i> distribution project of OpenSim, much like the Diva distribution.  In miniature, this is like Debian's (or other Linux 
</I>&gt;<i> distro's) relationship with Linux.  That way, there wouldn't be the high difficulty of trying to change an existing 
</I>&gt;<i> developer-oriented culture - instead the distro could start off with whatever structure and philosophy it pleased.  It 
</I>&gt;<i> could still fundraise and contribute changes/features back to OpenSim but at the same time it could do stuff which is 
</I>&gt;<i> always going to be hard in OpenSimulator itself (such as incorporate certain library content by default or add on web 
</I>&gt;<i> admin code).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     One of the problems with OpenSimulator project doing this, is it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     not an established company.  There is no central office or managers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     for this project.  That aside if you wanted to try to raise funds to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     hire programmers who will submit their code you could certainly do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that, you do not need OpenSimulator project to do this for you.  You
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     could also ask some of the OpenSim developers directly if they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     interested in working for bounty if you can raise the funds.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Another problem right now is most of the developers are way to busy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to organize fund raising events, and from my experience Money doesnt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     always solve problems, and can tend to complicate things to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     point they never actually get done, because once the funds run out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     work just flat out stops and is very difficult to get going again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     One thing you do not mention is what you would like to see finished
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     or what you feel is missing or incomplete.  OpenSimulator is a very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     open ended project and will likely always be morphing and changing,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     there will likely never be an end to its development, unlike a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     facebook website which has very limited purpose to its goals.  I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     going to assume you mean Second Life compatibility, this is really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     just a small piece of opensimulator and I will think that you will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     find that most of the people directly involved in OpenSimulator are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     not that interested in recreating second life, there are many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     avenues being pursued right now that look nothing like Second Life,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     one of the major factors really holding this project back is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     lack of a Open-Source viewer that the OpenSimulator developers can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     work on that is in a usable state, the Second Life viewer source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     code is off limits to OpenSimulator developers and because of this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     making OpenSimulator be second life compatible is not always easy or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     even possible at all in some cases.  I think once we see viewers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     like Realxtend Naali and others become more usable you will see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     OpenSimulator move even further from trying to be a second life
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     clone.  But these are just some of the reasons that I see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     OpenSimulator is taking as long as it has, and it will likely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     continue to take just as long no matter how much money you throw at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     it, but like i said, anyone who has the desire can raise funds and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     hire developers to get involved and contribute the code to this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     project, so please do not wait for the OpenSimulator developers to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     do this for you, as some of the developers that work for Intel Corp
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and IBM Corp, and others like Melanie and Justin have been paid to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     develop and create patches as well as for profit grids like Reaction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Grid, so its not like this is really something that is not currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     happening.  Hope this helps to explain atleast a little of why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     things are the way they are.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Okay, that was my catchy title that in no way means any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         disrespect.  I love OpenSim, have used it for years, tell
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         everyone I meet about it and am a huge fan and supporter.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Recently a question was asked about a roadmap and progress.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         would like to expand on that.  OpenSim has now been around for a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         while - like years.  Yet I can't really use it for clients.  So
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         here is my question.  As a non-coder, how can others help.  For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         example, I would gladly donate some decent money if there were a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         coordinated fundraising event and a plan to hire a couple of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         full-time, very qualified developers to really move this along.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Please, please, please don't take this the wrong way.  This is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         NOT a criticism.  I know this is done by volunteers and I know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         that this is more ambitious than Second Life, but have we looked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         at other solutions to move the process along.  I think there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         a lot of people like me who would contribute.  But, and I stress
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         this.  Me donating say $1,000 by myself isn't going to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         anything.  We would need a serious fundraising drive, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         specific and talented people that we could hire full-time as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         consultants/coders to really move this along.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I would imagine I am not the first to suggest this.  But every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         day I see this awesome product I want to use, yet it seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         months or years away from stable wide-spread use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         There are now several web sites that help in fundraising.  I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         sure many of you read about the NYU students that raised several
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         hundred thousand dollars in a short time so they could spend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         their summer coding a Facebook clone (sort of).  Now if 4
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         undergrads can get that kind of money for a Facebook clone, why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         hasn't OpenSim tried something similar.  These fundraising sites
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         are hot right now - let's take advantage of them!
