</I>
If I've understood Melanie's email correctly, the &quot;facts&quot; she wants to
collect are (supposedly short and catchy) statements about why you like
OpenSim. E.g., if you were thinking &quot;I like OpenSim because it is open
source.&quot;, the corresponding fact might be &quot;OpenSim is open source.&quot;.

The term &quot;fact&quot; might be a bit misleading here, as this inquiry doesn't
seem to be about what all /could/ be known about OpenSim, but rather
what you /do/ already know /and like/ about it.

I guess these statements are then candidates to be used on some feature
lists or &quot;fact sheets&quot; on the posters and flyers. So they would be for
promotional purposes only, not manuals, not specs, nor reference texts
or other kinds of documentation. Thus, (in this context) you shouldn't
have to bother what information is already available, as
comprehensiveness and completeness aren't required or even aimed for.

(Just my interpretation. Please correct me if I got this backwards.)

Cheers,
Borun
