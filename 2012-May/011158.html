<PRE>Anyone else noticing that the outfits do not seem to persist in 
OSGrid? I am using the latest stable  LL viewer 3.3.1.

I lost my previous working outfits, and even when creating new ones, 
they all were lost again after a log out and log back in. I tried 
waiting a while after creating the outfits before logout, and also 
creating the outfits on core regions like Wright Plaza... Same problem.

I went back to test outfits on own grid after an updated yesterday to 
r/18921 from the previous r/18447 some two months ago I did notice 
that all the outfits had changed so that they just seemed to show 
basic body parts... but when you equipped the outfit via the &quot;replace 
current outfit&quot; option all the previous items did get worn. I resaved 
the outfits.  But after logging off and back on no outfits show up, 
and the My Outfits folder in the inventory has gone.

I will take a more careful look at this and revert to an earlier 
OpenSim for tests top report this on mantis if its useful, but does 
anyone know about this to save time on investigation f its already noted?

</PRE>
