<PRE>My initial post in this thread was mistaken: OpenSim *does* allow group
features even if the user is just a member of the group (but it's not the
active group). The only problem is that getAgentGroupMembership() has a bug
if the user has never set *any* group as his active group. So that's what
I'm going to fix.

I don't know if that's how SecondLife behaves, but I feel strongly that it's
how it should behave, and anyway it's how OpenSim works. The only thing the
Active group should affect is the tag that is displayed above the user in
the viewer.
