Hallo, 

that is exactly how I set up my grid, when switching from
standalone to grid: OpenSim.ini includes the GridHypergrid.ini, this
includes the GridCommon.ini. In these I changed only the most basic
settings (hostname, etc.). The GridCommon.ini includes a MySettings.ini
which holds the settings that apply to every simulator. Last but not
least this includes a SimSettings.ini where I have set specific
Simsettings like Network-port and command prompt. 

OpenSim.ini
 -
GridHypergrid.ini
 - GridCommon.ini
 - MySettings.ini
 - SimSettings.ini


This may sound a bit complicated, but this way I can make changes in
MySettings.ini. Drop it inot each Simulator and do a rolling restart,
without having to change anything individually for each sim. 

Regards,


SilverDay

make small mistakes that is a quite common source of problems.

current standard settings and personal.ini (just as an example) contains
the few lines with my personal changes of the settings in opensim.ini.
The only line needed to set in opensim.ini is the path to the directory
where personal.ini, regions.ini and personal_grid.ini is located.

settings are performed. The same way for gridcommon.ini and
personal_grid.ini for the database settings. 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This makes it much

option directories, unpack the new file and edit that one line with the
path to settings directory. Done!

general impression of the grids.
