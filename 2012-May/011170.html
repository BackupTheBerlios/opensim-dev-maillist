<PRE>Thanks Justin and Mark,

Yep, you are both right in what I am asking in my question.

You hit the nail (squarely) on the head Mark.

Thanks for the info, your reply has captured the issues I have been
thinking about and challenges I'm am trying to solve.

You guys are very knowledgeable and always helpful.

Stan

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am guessing, that what Stanley is asking/suggesting is that the viewer
</I>&gt;<i> has the ability to automatically check to see what ports are
</I>&gt;<i> open/accessible (this way if someone was using a mobile laptop and using
</I>&gt;<i> various networks, and happened to use a work/school network that was
</I>&gt;<i> firewalled/restricted and certain ports were blocked, the viewer would show
</I>&gt;<i> some form of pop-up message, or possibly have a &quot;Port Viewer&quot; configuration
</I>&gt;<i> panel screen that showed which ports were being used and which ports are
</I>&gt;<i> open/blocked, thus preventing the viewer from working properly).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;END SHORT RESPONSE HERE&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;BEGIN LONG-WINDED RESPONSE HERE&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thereby making the user &quot;aware&quot; that certain ports (and possibly what
</I>&gt;<i> those ports are used for in &quot;clear english&quot; such as &quot;chat messaging port&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.) as well as a green/red indicator to show whether the port is
</I>&gt;<i> open/blocked, might be extremely beneficial to a &quot;laymen&quot; user (end user)
</I>&gt;<i> to help trouble shoot network connectivity problems with trying to connect
</I>&gt;<i> to an OpenSim Server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This way they could check see (from within the OpenSim Viewer) using the
</I>&gt;<i> Port Viewer control/configuration panel and simply see which ports are
</I>&gt;<i> blocked (red) and then ask their network/system administrator to please
</I>&gt;<i> open up those ports on their firewall (for specific individual users/MAC/IP
</I>&gt;<i> address ranges) so that certain individuals could have access to those
</I>&gt;<i> ports (opened by their system/network/campus administrators) so that those
</I>&gt;<i> users could in fact use and access an OpenSim server from that connection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim could be extremely troublesome for mobile users, especially if
</I>&gt;<i> they move between various networks (internal school network, internal
</I>&gt;<i> work/enterprise network, home/cable/dsl private network, public WiFi or
</I>&gt;<i> Wireless ISP (Verizon LTE / AT&amp;T LTE / T-Mobile / Clear) and this can cause
</I>&gt;<i> tremendous confusion to end users as well as ISP's as well as
</I>&gt;<i> Network/System Administrators (as to &quot;who's fault&quot; it is for the software
</I>&gt;<i> not working).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It could be any number of things.  There could be a hardware firewall
</I>&gt;<i> (controlled by a school/enterprise network admin) or possibly a software
</I>&gt;<i> firewall (controlled by a school/enterprise network admin) or possibly a
</I>&gt;<i> third-party software firewall (ZoneAlarm, COMODO, TrendMicro, Norton,
</I>&gt;<i> Windows 7 Firewall Control, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A very small list of the many (free) personal software firewalls can be
</I>&gt;<i> found here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://download.cnet.com/windows/firewall-software/">http://download.cnet.com/windows/firewall-software/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It can be a nightmare for a large university (or large business
</I>&gt;<i> enterprise) to try and help/support anyone that is using a fairly &quot;unknown&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> application such as OpenSim viewer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not a common application (like Google Talk, AIM, ICQ, FTP, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most admins would not know what ports would need to even be opened or
</I>&gt;<i> whether the trouble was being caused by a hardware firewall, or possibly a
</I>&gt;<i> software firewall (or software problem) on the local machine itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It could be fairly easy for Network/System Administrators to grant
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;OpenSim Users&quot; access (open hardware firewall ports to specific MAC
</I>&gt;<i> addresses or specific IP address ranges) but they would need to know
</I>&gt;<i> exactly what ports would need to be opened for that particular end user (or
</I>&gt;<i> it could be a simple matter of opening a software firewall port by remotely
</I>&gt;<i> accessing an Enterprise/University/student/teacher's Symatec Endpoint
</I>&gt;<i> Protection installation, and simply just opening up the ports needed for
</I>&gt;<i> that particular computer/device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Without having some form of &quot;Port Viewer&quot; panel (in the Client Viewer,
</I>&gt;<i> such as Imprudence or Hippo) it would be extremely difficult (and time
</I>&gt;<i> consuming) for Enterprise/University helpdesk staff or even ISP's customer
</I>&gt;<i> service, or a hardware vendor (such as Linksys, D-Link, SMC, Buffalo,
</I>&gt;<i> SonicWall, etc.) to try and help/support/explain WHY a particular software
</I>&gt;<i> application is not working properly (because it might be a hardware
</I>&gt;<i> firewall issue, or possibly a software firewall issue, or some form of
</I>&gt;<i> network connectivity problem).  Thus I can see how this type of
</I>&gt;<i> module/viewer code could in fact be extremely useful (for the average end
</I>&gt;<i> user as well as the average helpdesk support technician).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would allow the &quot;lay person&quot; to check to see exactly WHICH ports are
</I>&gt;<i> open and which ports are blocked.  (Possibly use a green light to show that
</I>&gt;<i> a port is open/accessible, and a red light to show that a particular port
</I>&gt;<i> is closed/blocked next to the specific port number, and also give a brief
</I>&gt;<i> description of what that port number is used for, voice chat, text
</I>&gt;<i> messaging, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This way with just a quick glance at a port panel (in the viewer) the user
</I>&gt;<i> could see EXACTLY which ports are blocked and which ports are open. (to
</I>&gt;<i> determine if there are any firewall or proxy issues).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This way end users could simply ask/request that their network/system
</I>&gt;<i> administrators open up whatever specific ports that they need to have
</I>&gt;<i> opened (based on the red/green light indicators on the viewer control
</I>&gt;<i> panel).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would make it extremely easy for the end users, especially mobile users
</I>&gt;<i> (that use laptops) that often travel between various networks (home, work,
</I>&gt;<i> public, etc) and may run into trouble/problems based on the network they
</I>&gt;<i> are currently connected to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This type of &quot;port viewer&quot; control panel, would simply make it extremely
</I>&gt;<i> easy for the end user to see what the current port status is (which ports
</I>&gt;<i> are open/blocked) so they can figure out whether it's a personal software
</I>&gt;<i> (personal firewall) or possibly a network firewall (network admin/system
</I>&gt;<i> admin) problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's much easier for the end user to see (and a System/Network Admin
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have to talk a user through various command line commands to try
</I>&gt;<i> and figure out whether the problem or use specific software (or command
</I>&gt;<i> line commands) to try and test individual ports on a remote user's
</I>&gt;<i> computer, and it helps isolate the trouble/problem with a specific person's
</I>&gt;<i> personal laptop configuration or individual software firewall/antivirus
</I>&gt;<i> program configuration like Trendmicro Firewall, Symantec Endpoint
</I>&gt;<i> Protection, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some businesses/companies/schools may use a personal remotely-configurable
</I>&gt;<i> software firewall in addition to a hardware firewall (especially for
</I>&gt;<i> laptops and mobile devices).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&amp;id=TECH169904">http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&amp;id=TECH169904</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a user installs COMODO (or throw in Windows 7 Firewall) it makes things
</I>&gt;<i> even more complicated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It can be a REAL headache for system/network admins to try and
</I>&gt;<i> troubleshoot (or walk a user that is calling the &quot;help desk&quot; for support)
</I>&gt;<i> on an unknown software application such as OpenSim (or an OpenSim Viewer
</I>&gt;<i> such as Imprudence).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 99.9% of the system/network administrators in the world would have NO CLUE
</I>&gt;<i> as to what ports OpenSim (or any OpenSim Viewer such as Imprudence or
</I>&gt;<i> Naali) uses, and most end users wouldn't know either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So it would make it extremely difficult for most internet service
</I>&gt;<i> providers as well as school/work/enterprise admins to support, or even help
</I>&gt;<i> with a trouble ticket (especially if the viewer was &quot;rebranded&quot; and called
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;XYZ Viewer&quot; or &quot;ABC Viewer&quot; where no matter how much time a System/Network
</I>&gt;<i> Admin wasted trying to help such a user, it would be nearly
</I>&gt;<i> futile/impossible with trying to trouble shoot the issue if the end user
</I>&gt;<i> himself didn't even know what ports needed to be opened, and whether or not
</I>&gt;<i> their own personal firewall could be blocking any of those ports).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many universities (and enterprises/businesses) use Symantec products
</I>&gt;<i> (especially &quot;Endpoint Protection&quot;) so Network/System Admins can remotely
</I>&gt;<i> access the clients personal firewall (SEP client), and remotely configure
</I>&gt;<i> the firewall (and open ports as needed) on a laptop owned by the
</I>&gt;<i> school/university or business.  Some companies actually REQUIRE any system
</I>&gt;<i> that accesses an internal network (whether it be access the local LAN, or
</I>&gt;<i> even VPN access) to have a client install of Symantec Endpoint installed,
</I>&gt;<i> this way System/Network Admins know that the system is clean (no viruses)
</I>&gt;<i> and is up to date with it's virus definitions and scans, as well as ensure
</I>&gt;<i> that no rogue individuals/hackers/software/malware is installed on a
</I>&gt;<i> computer that could be used to maliciously attack users (or servers) on the
</I>&gt;<i> internal network (that are behind the firewall).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes even just remote mobile users (even using their own personal
</I>&gt;<i> computers) must install SEP (Symantec Endpoint Protection 11.x) because
</I>&gt;<i> their Enterprise/University Admins require it (prior to accessing the
</I>&gt;<i> internal network).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's often difficult for a non-technical end user to try and
</I>&gt;<i> troubleshoot/determine whether it is a hardware firewall issue, or software
</I>&gt;<i> firewall issue (or ISP/WiFi public network issue), or even a hardware issue
</I>&gt;<i> (such as a Linksys, Netgear, or D-Link router/firewall issue).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hardware Firewalls are generally placed between servers/users and the
</I>&gt;<i> external network (internet).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But there is often NO PROTECTION placed between users (on the same subnet,
</I>&gt;<i> or those behind the corporate hardware firewall).  This is why software
</I>&gt;<i> firewalls (such as Symantec Endpoint Protection) exist and are fairly
</I>&gt;<i> common in the enterprise/workplace/school environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here: <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symantec_Endpoint_Protection">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symantec_Endpoint_Protection</A>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can see where adding such a thing as a &quot;Port Viewer&quot; to the Imprudence
</I>&gt;<i> Client viewer could be an EXTREMELY good idea, especially for
</I>&gt;<i> school/mobile/enterprise/home users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would only take seconds for a user to see which ports are being
</I>&gt;<i> blocked, and then it would be EXTREMELY easy for ANY admin (even one that
</I>&gt;<i> is not familiar with Imprudence or OpenSim) to simply walk them through the
</I>&gt;<i> correct steps (or use a remote desktop application to help configure any
</I>&gt;<i> software or ports that might need to be opened on their individual
</I>&gt;<i> computer).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Symantec Endpoint Protection is just ONE of many software firewalls out
</I>&gt;<i> there, and SEP is remotely configurable (by the Enterprise Network Admin)
</I>&gt;<i> but if that computer was used on a different network (and those ports were
</I>&gt;<i> not opened) on the software firewall, the user might not even
</I>&gt;<i> realize/understand that it's their personal firewall blocking those ports
</I>&gt;<i> (and not their network hardware firewall or their ISP or public WiFi
</I>&gt;<i> network).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;-  END LONG WINDED RESPONSE HERE -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would actually be a great idea to implement such a feature in
</I>&gt;<i> the viewer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Especially if it was made to &quot;look cool&quot; and be very simple and easy to
</I>&gt;<i> use/view.  (Like simply just list all the port numbers, list their uses,
</I>&gt;<i> and then have a green/red light to indicate whether the ports is
</I>&gt;<i> open/blocked or not).
