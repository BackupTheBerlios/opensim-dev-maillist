<PRE>Thanks for finding the bug. I was puzzled with this behavior too when I 
switched D2 to 0.7.3.
Someone sent me an animation script that doesn't hit that bug, so I 
updated the walking animations that come in the D2 library.
But please do send the patch.

&gt;<i> I found the problem. The walking script is notified whenever the user presses
</I>&gt;<i> or releases a movement key, e.g. the Forward key. When that happens, the
</I>&gt;<i> script checks which movement animation the avatar is currently using, and
</I>&gt;<i> starts or stops the custom animation according to whether the movement
</I>&gt;<i> animation is &quot;WALK&quot; or not. There were several problems with this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. In ScenePresence, when the client moves, the &quot;control&quot; notification was
</I>&gt;<i> sent to the scripts before the avatar's animation had been updated, so the
</I>&gt;<i> walking script was using the wrong animation to make its decisions. Now the
</I>&gt;<i> scripts are notified only after the animation has been updated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Sometimes multiple threads were trying to update the avatar's movement
</I>&gt;<i> animation at once, again causing the script to see the wrong animation. I
</I>&gt;<i> added a lock to prevent threads from interfering with each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. When choosing the avatar's movement animation, if the avatar stopped
</I>&gt;<i> walking while it was falling (even if the &quot;fall&quot; was really just a tiny bump
</I>&gt;<i> in the ground) then the avatar animation remained on &quot;WALK&quot;. I changed it to
</I>&gt;<i> set the animation to &quot;STAND&quot; in this case. (It would have changed to &quot;STAND&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> soon anyway, but that delay caused the walking script to fail.) Note that
</I>&gt;<i> this only affects the beginning of a fall; if the fall takes a long time
</I>&gt;<i> then the avatar switches to the &quot;FALLING&quot; animation, and I didn't change
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The situation is much improved now: I haven't been able to cause the walking
</I>&gt;<i> animation bug to happen anymore (although it's possible that there are other
</I>&gt;<i> cases I haven't hit upon). I will submit this patch after I finish updating
</I>&gt;<i> our system to OpenSim 0.7.3.
