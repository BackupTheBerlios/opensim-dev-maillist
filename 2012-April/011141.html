<PRE>Hi,

we are getting ready to do final graphics and design for the real
life presence of OpenSimulator at LinuxTag, Berlin, from May 23rd.

For that, we would like to generate some more copy for posters,
flyers, etc.

Although this is a German event and these will ultimately have to be
done in German, we would still like to hear from all of you (in
German if you can, otherwise in English) what you like about OpenSim
and what OpenSim is to you.

We are looking to collect these key facts to gather some ideas as to
what copy would grab people's interest.

Please reply before May 5th as these things have to be in print by
end of play, European time, on the 4th.

Also, we could still use people to staff the booth on the 23rd, 24th
and 25th, answering questions about OpenSim and doing
demonstrations. German language is a must, English is nice to have.
Location is Berlin, Germany from 23rd of May till 26th of May.

If you'd like to help, please email <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">info at opensimulator.org.</A>

Cheers,

Melanie
</PRE>
