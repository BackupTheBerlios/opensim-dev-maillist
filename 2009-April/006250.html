Sounds good to me (might be just easier to now go with this and amend later if necessary).

As a small point, the &quot;Grid&quot; definition would appear to mean that our current 'Standalone' mode is confusingly also a 
&quot;Grid&quot;.  Is there a suitable alternative term to &quot;Grid&quot; for this definition?  I've run into this problem myself when 
writing about OpenSim.  I keep having to using unclear formulations such as OpenSim installations.

I guess alternatively, a &quot;Grid&quot; could be a set of a simulators where cardinality &gt; 1, though that might complicate the 
&quot;Hypergrid&quot; definition.

Also as a small suggestion, it might be helpful to write this in a glossary on the wiki somewhere so we can point back 
to it.  I think ages ago someone started a general one but I wouldn't be surprised if it has been buried by now.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In most cases (I would expect) a grid contains exactly 1 trust domain. 
</I>&gt;<i> But in some cases, it may contain more. If you think about it, the 
</I>&gt;<i> Linden Lab grid is a &quot;grid&quot; according to the above definition, and so is 
</I>&gt;<i> OSGrid. The mechanisms by which grid operators establish sim trust 
</I>&gt;<i> domains are entirely up to the grid operators. They may apply formal 
</I>&gt;<i> TOSs or they may put the grid login password on the web. They may issue 
</I>&gt;<i> formal trust certificates (one or more sets) or they may not do such a 
</I>&gt;<i> thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the purposes of security, it's clear that the client can't talk 
</I>&gt;<i> directly to a central grid-wide server, but it has to do it with the 
</I>&gt;<i> specific simulators, which then can redirect to their authorities.
