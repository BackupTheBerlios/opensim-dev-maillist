<PRE>I like to think of opensim as the VW version of Apache.

I think something that is confusing us is that moving from region to region
in opensim is pratically seemless, and the joins between the regions almost
invisible. IE when walking from one region to another, you can see the new
region appearing on the horizon, as if its just a continuation of the region
you are in.

In apache you can also move between sites / pages, but the change is much
more visible, you have to actually click on a link and move away from your
current page, its obvious that you have gone from one area to another, more
so when moving between sites. 

Both opensim regions and apache(internet) sites allow you to move between
content hosted by different people and/or on different servers. I believe
THIS is the area where the confusion comes in. In the conventional internet
we don't mind typing a zillion passwords because we can obviously see that
the pages are different. But in opensim it would seem strange to type in a
password just to be able to take an extra step on the road you are already
on.

Personal opinion:
- I don't believe centralising user profiles and managing permissions from
there is a good idea for an open source project.
- I do believe, as I have mentioned earlier, that opensim should have a very
simple region based password system and the client should be allowed to
manage multiple passwords such as a messenger or email application. This
would divide the task of security up between components in an equal and
logical way.

So opensim would allow grids and regions to ask for passwords from different
user server components, and the client software would allow the creation of
a user profile with multiple saved passwords.

This would not break anything as it stands as it would be possible to set a
region security to &quot;grid&quot; so anyone allowed to used the grid would also be
able to use the regions, however, a region owner would be able to restrict
useage in their own region and take ownership of their own user base, while
managing their own hardware and content useage. This would facilitate social
groups, business interests, and various other applications for the VW.

In my view:
Grid: Hosting company
Region: Web page (perhaps only using the hosting company to link to a
private server)

I think we already have an understanding of what is needed for securing
  users from malicious hosts: client-side control, that's all. Client has
direct control over user agents, user's inventory, IM, social network, etc.
The regions stay out of it, they are only simulators of objects and agents.
Grider is exploring that design space, and instrumenting OpenSim for it.
We're very close to having OpenSim support these kinds of clients.

However, in some cases, the user may want to give control, at least some, to
the ... and this is where terminology gets tricky... 
simulators? &quot;grid&quot;? And why would that be, you may ask. Well, because that
server-side (not to get into the choice of words again) may provide some
cool stuff if you pass it the control. It may, for example, give you an
additional world-specific inventory, or it may open agents for you in
interesting 3d spaces, or you won't be able to play whatever game is going
on in there unless the server-side has control over some of your data.

But even this is *sortof* relatively simple to do, IF we align the concept
of VW with the concept of trust domain. OSGrid, however, doesn't do that. So
what would it mean for a user to visit OSGrid? With which server would the
user's client share authority, if it were to share it?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authority). Then, a Web of VWs is the interconnection of those domains of
</I>trust.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, OSGrid doesn't align with that. So either OSGrid is not a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with that unwritten assumption. In my infinite tolerance towards 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> variety, and given the empirical evidence here, I'm leaning towards the
</I>latter (i.e.
&gt;&gt;<i> there's something wrong with that assumption).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately I am not too familiar on how OSGrid works but I can 
</I>&gt;<i> explain how it could work with the scenario I described where we have 
</I>&gt;<i> quite many separate services.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this case a user would login to a region with separate locations of 
</I>&gt;<i> the user's inventory, a list of links to group memberships, a link to 
</I>&gt;<i> the user's profile and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The region would then ask an authorization manager to get access to 
</I>&gt;<i> these resources on behalf of the user. The user will then be asked 
</I>&gt;<i> with a list of services the region wants access to and on &quot;ok&quot; this 
</I>&gt;<i> access will be granted in form of OAuth access token which can be used 
</I>&gt;<i> to perform signed requests to these services. (the concept of the auth 
</I>&gt;<i> manager needs to be developed as mentioned).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So in this case the region can only access a user's data after getting 
</I>&gt;<i> those tokens. If this &quot;ok&quot; is given automatically though security will 
</I>&gt;<i> obviously be lacking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now many regions could be grouped into one region domain which might 
</I>&gt;<i> mean that they e.g. provide some mapping services and they could maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> use shared access to that data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of a region domain consisting of regions operated by 
</I>&gt;<i> different providers this of course means that a rogue sim indeed could 
</I>&gt;<i> get access to that data. But in general I don't see a solution here 
</I>&gt;<i> unless you really give each sim access upon visiting. Which of course 
</I>&gt;<i> would be annoying.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, OSGrid, as is, will always be extremely vulnerable towards 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> insider rogues; technically, it's impossible to secure OSGrid's UGAIM 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> servers from malicious sims connected to it. But so what? Maybe 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people want it like that, maybe the OSGrid community wants to perform 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> human surveillance instead of applying technical solutions such as 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Hypergrid (once it's matured). Should we stop supporting that use
</I>case?
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think in the case of a grid which is operated by many people and you 
</I>&gt;<i> don't want just a shared map but also shared access for convenience 
</I>&gt;<i> there is not much left for kicking out rogue domains. In fact a user 
</I>&gt;<i> might not know that it's a bad sim when entering it anyway so even in 
</I>&gt;<i> the case of a confirmation on each crossing that sim would probably 
</I>&gt;<i> gain access.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Moreover I think bad clients is the more likely case of e.g. content 
</I>&gt;<i> theft).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we continue to support the existence of grids like OSGrid, then we 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to think what it means for the users to visit such grids, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how they can visit them securely -- that's all I'm trying to figure out.
</I>&gt;<i>

OSGrid uses the OpenSim UserServer for its &quot;trust domain&quot;, as do all other
OpenSim grids. 

Perhaps you need to change your semantics or argument a bit as there is
nothing different about OSGrid then any of the other OpenSim grids.

If you could perhaps make your debate a bit more focused on OpenSim grids in
general, then maybe we can figure out how to accomodate your thought
processes.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] The essence of &quot;grid&quot;

I think we already have an understanding of what is needed for securing
  users from malicious hosts: client-side control, that's all. Client has
direct control over user agents, user's inventory, IM, social network, etc.
The regions stay out of it, they are only simulators of objects and agents.
Grider is exploring that design space, and instrumenting OpenSim for it.
We're very close to having OpenSim support these kinds of clients.

However, in some cases, the user may want to give control, at least some, to
the ... and this is where terminology gets tricky... 
simulators? &quot;grid&quot;? And why would that be, you may ask. Well, because that
server-side (not to get into the choice of words again) may provide some
cool stuff if you pass it the control. It may, for example, give you an
additional world-specific inventory, or it may open agents for you in
interesting 3d spaces, or you won't be able to play whatever game is going
on in there unless the server-side has control over some of your data.

But even this is *sortof* relatively simple to do, IF we align the concept
of VW with the concept of trust domain. OSGrid, however, doesn't do that. So
what would it mean for a user to visit OSGrid? With which server would the
user's client share authority, if it were to share it?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately I am not too familiar on how OSGrid works but I can 
</I>&gt;<i> explain how it could work with the scenario I described where we have 
</I>&gt;<i> quite many separate services.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this case a user would login to a region with separate locations of 
</I>&gt;<i> the user's inventory, a list of links to group memberships, a link to 
</I>&gt;<i> the user's profile and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The region would then ask an authorization manager to get access to 
</I>&gt;<i> these resources on behalf of the user. The user will then be asked 
</I>&gt;<i> with a list of services the region wants access to and on &quot;ok&quot; this 
</I>&gt;<i> access will be granted in form of OAuth access token which can be used 
</I>&gt;<i> to perform signed requests to these services. (the concept of the auth 
</I>&gt;<i> manager needs to be developed as mentioned).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So in this case the region can only access a user's data after getting 
</I>&gt;<i> those tokens. If this &quot;ok&quot; is given automatically though security will 
</I>&gt;<i> obviously be lacking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now many regions could be grouped into one region domain which might 
</I>&gt;<i> mean that they e.g. provide some mapping services and they could maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> use shared access to that data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of a region domain consisting of regions operated by 
</I>&gt;<i> different providers this of course means that a rogue sim indeed could 
</I>&gt;<i> get access to that data. But in general I don't see a solution here 
</I>&gt;<i> unless you really give each sim access upon visiting. Which of course 
</I>&gt;<i> would be annoying.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, OSGrid, as is, will always be extremely vulnerable towards 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> insider rogues; technically, it's impossible to secure OSGrid's UGAIM 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> servers from malicious sims connected to it. But so what? Maybe

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> human surveillance instead of applying technical solutions such as 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Hypergrid (once it's matured). Should we stop supporting that use
</I>case?
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think in the case of a grid which is operated by many people and you 
</I>&gt;<i> don't want just a shared map but also shared access for convenience 
</I>&gt;<i> there is not much left for kicking out rogue domains. In fact a user

</I>&gt;<i> gain access.
