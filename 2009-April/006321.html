I think the idea was to be able to delegate login via a possible 3rd
party.  The predominate pattern there is username password via human
interaction, so you need a redirect or a popup.

</I>&gt;<i> he/she wants without ever needing those services to redirect.
</I>
Agree with this, and this is exactly how SSL works (which browsers do
use), though any key system with challenge response mechanism would
work equally well.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what is it about the Web that made people come up with this idea of
</I>&gt;<i> redirecting the login procedure across trust domain boundaries?
</I>
OpenID works well on the web, and people are happy with the redirect,
and it has gained a lot of traction in the web community.  I
personally use a stateful browser with SSL keys to log in to a
website, or even to an openid site, but I guess im more of a power
user.  At the end of the day it beats the previous alternative hands
down, which was having to pay $50,000 to join the Microsoft passport
scheme!
