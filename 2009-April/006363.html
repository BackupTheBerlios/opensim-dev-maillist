&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  On your previous suggested ini stuff, in my opinion something like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; UserService = { local | remote }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be clearer than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; LocalUserService = {True|False}
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  From what I remember, specifying remote is understandable even if the services are actually on the same machine (but 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one has chosen to run them as separate processes).  Local would naturally denote the use of services in the same process 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   as the simulator.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, there's a subtle but very important difference in the case of 
</I>&gt;<i> hypergrid. A standalone grid wanting to allow Guests would have to use 
</I>&gt;<i> the Remote dll, even though the service for local users is local.
</I>
I don't see a problem with 'chaining' services; something like

[RegionResourceServices]

GridService = OpenSim.Region.Communications.Hypergrid.dll, HGGridServices

[Hypergrid]
RemoteGridService = OpenSim.Region.Communications.OGS1.dll, OGS1GridServices 

&gt;<i> This is, in fact, the kernel of the complexity here. Local has been 
</I>&gt;<i> designed to be Sandbox connectors, and OSG1 has been designed to connect 
</I>&gt;<i> with exactly *one* of each type of service. All remote calls in it 
</I>&gt;<i> hardcode serversInfo.xxxURL.
</I>
Yes. As part of the login/distributed assets refactoring, I was thinking of introducing an UserServicesManager that would keep proxies to all registered user services. Of course, I never got that far.

&gt;<i> The Hypergrid needs the regions to interact with *several* of each type 
</I>&gt;<i> of service, potentially, including the local one. So, most of the 
</I>&gt;<i> hypergrid changes have to do with determining local vs remote and, if 
</I>&gt;<i> remote, determining the service URL, making it a variable instead of a 
</I>&gt;<i> constant.
</I>
Again, some kind of repository for proxy classes would probably be the easy way, I think. the proxy classes could just as well be non-proxy persistent (local db), non-proxy volatile (in-mem), proxy to 'home' user service or proxy to foreign service. It would be the proxies that contained the protocol-specific functions to resolve calls (or just local in-mem calls in case of local)

+1 on the

&gt;<i> AllowGuests = {True|False}
</I>vs
&gt;<i> gridmode = {True|False}
</I>

&gt;<i> So if we want to keep 3 architectures around, as separate architectures 
</I>&gt;<i> (and not one, more general), we have a meta option here:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ServiceConnectors = {Sandbox|LLGrid|Hypergrid}
</I>
again, I guess service connector plugins could report a 'short name' that could be used in resolving configurations like this.
 
&gt;<i> With this, I can make the hypergrid architecture have configuration 
</I>&gt;<i> variables to be able to generate all of the behaviors of Sandbox and 
</I>&gt;<i> LLGrid, and more -- basically place the ideas on my original email under 
</I>&gt;<i> the Hypergrid mode, and leave the other two as they are now.
</I>
For what it's worth, I think that all the various services should share a common abstract baseclass (per domain) so we can pull up and push down freely.
