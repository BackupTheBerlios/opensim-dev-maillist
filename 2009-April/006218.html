<PRE>&quot;I can't visualize Bank of America using opensim for transactions.&quot;

Why not?

IBM is already providing &quot;meeting room space&quot; for companies. I guess each
room would then be a subset of a region with different access rights.

Personally I can't visualise that opensim will remain a secondlife clone. It
has too much potential. I really think design choices should be made in such
a way as to promote diversity, rather than based on what we can visualise
today.

&quot;opensim should have a very simple region based password system&quot;

Sounds like a re-invented 1996 Palace Chat, based on rooms. I can't
visualize Bank of America using opensim for transactions. So the security
should fit the threat of loss vs the inconvenience to users mobility.
If such a system comes into being, please map in red so to avoid those
grids.

&gt;<i>I like to think of opensim as the VW version of Apache.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think something that is confusing us is that moving from region to 
</I>&gt;<i> region
</I>&gt;<i> in opensim is pratically seemless, and the joins between the regions 
</I>&gt;<i> almost
</I>&gt;<i> invisible. IE when walking from one region to another, you can see the new
</I>&gt;<i> region appearing on the horizon, as if its just a continuation of the 
</I>&gt;<i> region
</I>&gt;<i> you are in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In apache you can also move between sites / pages, but the change is much
</I>&gt;<i> more visible, you have to actually click on a link and move away from your
</I>&gt;<i> current page, its obvious that you have gone from one area to another, 
</I>&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;<i> so when moving between sites.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both opensim regions and apache(internet) sites allow you to move between
</I>&gt;<i> content hosted by different people and/or on different servers. I believe
</I>&gt;<i> THIS is the area where the confusion comes in. In the conventional 
</I>&gt;<i> internet
</I>&gt;<i> we don't mind typing a zillion passwords because we can obviously see that
</I>&gt;<i> the pages are different. But in opensim it would seem strange to type in a
</I>&gt;<i> password just to be able to take an extra step on the road you are already
</I>&gt;<i> on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personal opinion:
</I>&gt;<i> - I don't believe centralising user profiles and managing permissions from
</I>&gt;<i> there is a good idea for an open source project.
</I>&gt;<i> - I do believe, as I have mentioned earlier, that opensim should have a 
</I>&gt;<i> very
</I>&gt;<i> simple region based password system and the client should be allowed to
</I>&gt;<i> manage multiple passwords such as a messenger or email application. This
</I>&gt;<i> would divide the task of security up between components in an equal and
</I>&gt;<i> logical way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So opensim would allow grids and regions to ask for passwords from 
</I>&gt;<i> different
</I>&gt;<i> user server components, and the client software would allow the creation 
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> a user profile with multiple saved passwords.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would not break anything as it stands as it would be possible to set 
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> region security to &quot;grid&quot; so anyone allowed to used the grid would also be
</I>&gt;<i> able to use the regions, however, a region owner would be able to restrict
</I>&gt;<i> useage in their own region and take ownership of their own user base, 
</I>&gt;<i> while
</I>&gt;<i> managing their own hardware and content useage. This would facilitate 
</I>&gt;<i> social
</I>&gt;<i> groups, business interests, and various other applications for the VW.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my view:
</I>&gt;<i> Grid: Hosting company
</I>&gt;<i> Region: Web page (perhaps only using the hosting company to link to a
</I>&gt;<i> private server)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> I think we already have an understanding of what is needed for securing

</I>&gt;<i> We're very close to having OpenSim support these kinds of clients.

</I>&gt;<i> the ... and this is where terminology gets tricky...

</I>&gt;<i> interesting 3d spaces, or you won't be able to play whatever game is going
</I>&gt;<i> on in there unless the server-side has control over some of your data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But even this is *sortof* relatively simple to do, IF we align the concept

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> trust.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Well, OSGrid doesn't align with that. So either OSGrid is not a

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> variety, and given the empirical evidence here, I'm leaning towards the
</I>&gt;<i> latter (i.e.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there's something wrong with that assumption).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately I am not too familiar on how OSGrid works but I can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explain how it could work with the scenario I described where we have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quite many separate services.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In this case a user would login to a region with separate locations of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the user's inventory, a list of links to group memberships, a link to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the user's profile and so on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The region would then ask an authorization manager to get access to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these resources on behalf of the user. The user will then be asked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a list of services the region wants access to and on &quot;ok&quot; this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> access will be granted in form of OAuth access token which can be used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to perform signed requests to these services. (the concept of the auth
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manager needs to be developed as mentioned).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So in this case the region can only access a user's data after getting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those tokens. If this &quot;ok&quot; is given automatically though security will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obviously be lacking.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now many regions could be grouped into one region domain which might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mean that they e.g. provide some mapping services and they could maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use shared access to that data.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the case of a region domain consisting of regions operated by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different providers this of course means that a rogue sim indeed could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get access to that data. But in general I don't see a solution here
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unless you really give each sim access upon visiting. Which of course
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be annoying.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, OSGrid, as is, will always be extremely vulnerable towards
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> insider rogues; technically, it's impossible to secure OSGrid's UGAIM
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> servers from malicious sims connected to it. But so what? Maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> people want it like that, maybe the OSGrid community wants to perform
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> human surveillance instead of applying technical solutions such as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the Hypergrid (once it's matured). Should we stop supporting that use
</I>&gt;<i> case?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think in the case of a grid which is operated by many people and you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't want just a shared map but also shared access for convenience
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is not much left for kicking out rogue domains. In fact a user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might not know that it's a bad sim when entering it anyway so even in

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gain access.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Moreover I think bad clients is the more likely case of e.g. content

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; If OSGrid-like grids (i.e. no contracts, or very loose ones;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just a map  &gt; service) are to exist, then it's clear that b) doesn't

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; It means that there can be grids that are simply a collection of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> regions  &gt; that come together in virtual space, but whose

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; The Hypergrid is specifically designed to cross trust

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> share the same map, and let  &gt; &quot;grids&quot; be, fully, trust domains?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; You may think I'm getting into philosophy, but this is critical
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for the  &gt; technical work I'm doing right now related to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> authentication,  &gt; server-side vs client-side authority, etc. If we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can assume that a  &gt; &quot;grid&quot; is a uniform trust domain with a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> central authority, things will  &gt; be simpler in many ways. If not,
</I>&gt;<i> things will be a bit more complicated.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; Thoughts?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think that you could adopt b) without having a philosophical
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problem with OSGrid.  I would say that even the 'loose contracts'
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> on OSGrid are a form of trust.  If someone were to abuse that trust
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> then I be very surprised if they were not removed from the grid.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If OSGrid wanted better security by not sharing the current central
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> services then perhaps they could stipulate that new regions had to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> connect by Hypergrid rather than the current model (once the

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Then, in a sense, all the directly connected regions becomes a

My attempt which is now a little stale can be found here:

<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/flotsam/downloads/detail?name=vehicle.3.patch">http://code.google.com/p/flotsam/downloads/detail?name=vehicle.3.patch</A>

Some of the things that I found:

* dAMotorEuler is not appropriate.  I could not find a any set of 
parameters for the aMotor that would even begin to remotely approximate 
the behavior for a vertical attractor, I had to instead turn to using 
dAMotorUser.  dAMotorUser requires that at each step, you specify at 
what angle(s) the joint is at, rather then having the ODE attempt to 
calculate it automatically.  I also ran into gimbal lock issues with 
aMotorEuler, since the vertical attractor needs to work with 2 or 3 
axises with a full 360 deg range of motion.

* The closest approximation I could get was to essentially set the stops 
at near 0 degs of movement, and then adjust CFM, StopCFM and ERP values 
to control how much the aMotor would attempt to correct the angles 
beyond the stops.

* FudgeFactor and Bounce had little to no visible effect during my 
experiments

* FMax appeared not to affect CFM/ERP behavior, and only seemed to be 
used when you use Vel


The best results I could get adjusting CFM/ERP values had the following 
results:

+ If you manually rotated a physical object out of vertical using the 
editor and then &quot;let go&quot; -- it would more or less smoothly return to 
vertical, although sometimes it would move past vertical and then 
oscillate back and forth, usually taking minutes to come to a rest, 
sometimes never coming to a rest.

+ If I set an object to float (either via buoyancy or the HoverHeight 
PID) and I &quot;bumped&quot; the object with my avatar to impart rotation, it 
would nearly always wildly oscillate, usually obtain vertical on one or 
two axis, and then rarely coming to a rest on the third.  Occasionally 
it would rotate violently, launching my avatar either 1000's of meters 
vertically, under ground, or out of the region.

I was tempted to push what I had to the main SVN, but was unhappy with 
the results so I never got around to it -- then got distracted by Sun, 
Wind, Groups, etc...

Just my pittance,

Assumptions: 
* We want to create virtual space
* We want to put this virtual space on networks to allow networked 
viewers to enter and possibly interact
* Some people may want to restrict what is and isn't allowed in their 
virtual space, including who is allowed and what they can do while there
* What we call a &quot;Region&quot; is simulation of a 256m x 256m region of 
virtual space

My thoughts:

To me, a Grid is a virtual space that can be of any given size, and to 
date, currently consists of one or more discrete Regions that are laid 
out in a two dimensional grid pattern.  A Grid allows for these discrete 
individual spaces to be joined together to provide a seamless virtual 
space that viewers can traverse as if they were a single large simulation.

A Grid can consist of just a single Region, or many Regions.

Within a Grid, it may be desirable to assign ownership of virtual space 
to specific agents for administration.  Those agents, through their 
viewers (or other means) should be able to determine who may enter their 
space, what those visitors can do once there, including what 
communications are available and what objects they may simulate.  
Currently we determine areas of administration in 256m^2 regions of 
space, that are then sub-divided by parcels.

To me the concept of a Region is inseparable from that of a Grid, 
because a Grid is a simply a representation of space and a Region a 
subset of that space.  Moving forward, the subsets of space within a 
Grid may not be 256m x 256m, instead they may be 1m x 1m, or they may be 
1000m x 1000m -- currently we're using 256m^2 simply because the legacy 
SL based viewers we have assume that regions of space within a Grid will 
be that size.  We already have people that are &quot;splitting&quot; the 
simulation of space represented by a Region, and the current 
implementation of OpenSim already allows for a single simulation to 
represent larger areas, albeit in 256m^2 chunks.

The various &quot;grid services&quot; -- such as users, inventory, assets, groups, 
messaging -- are what determines who may or may not interact with the 
virtual space, and what may or may not be placed within that virtual 
space, and how those who are connected to that space may communicate 
within and via that space.


For what this means to Diva's original question, I'm not sure.  But 
here's a few things to contemplate:

* If a subset of the assets an agent is going to use are solely in their 
control, and they specifically have to grant permission for a simulation 
to use those assets, then that negotiation should not be with a Region 
or a specific instance of simulation, but instead with a Grid.  Because 
in the seamless environment that a grid represents, a viewer who is 600m 
away may be looking at your avatar -- and the simulation that the viewer 
is in will need access to the assets that represent your appearance.  
This scenario is a little clouded, but still true with existing 
hypergrid regions now -- because every instance of OpenSim, is, in 
itself a self contained &quot;Grid.&quot;

* Just because something is called a trust domain, does not mean that I 
trust it.  There are a lot of web sites out in the wild, each could be 
considered to be a stand alone trust domain, and some via certificates 
or other mechanisms join a larger trust domain, and I don't extend any 
level of trust to them what'so'ever and would never provide them with 
any personal data.  Other trust domains I will extend a little trust, 
I'll give them my email address, a preferred user name/alias, and a 
security token (password) that I will use just for them -- other trust 
domains I extend full trust to and share much of my important personal 
data with.  All that being a trust domain means, is that those members 
within that domain will fall under the administration of, and policies 
set forth by the trust domain -- if those policies are &quot;Do what you 
want, and here's some unsecured storage space you can use, and an 
unverified database of users you can peruse&quot;, then as a user you must 
decide what level of actual trust to extend.  Often people extend more 
trust then they should through miss-understanding, for example people 
extended trust to Linden Labs on the *assumption* that their assets 
would be safe and protected from being copying within their trust domain 
(Second Life) -- however LL never made any such promise, nor are they 
even capable of enforcing such a policy {with a few exceptions including 
scripts and personal data, such as CC #'s}.


Cheers,
