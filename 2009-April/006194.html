<PRE>Hi!

</I>
That usually is my problem with most of these discussions be it on MMOX, 
AWG or social networking. So it would be good to have some sort of list 
of what needs to be secured against what sort of action.

&gt;<i> I've seen way too many talks/chats/posts/blogs talking about a Web of 
</I>&gt;<i> VWs in some form, while making the unwritten assumption that the concept 
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;grid&quot; (aka Virtual World unit, or whatever you want to call it) 
</I>&gt;<i> aligns with the concept of a domain of trust (i.e. a bunch of simulators 
</I>&gt;<i> that trust each other, under the control of one authority). Then, a Web 
</I>&gt;<i> of VWs is the interconnection of those domains of trust.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, OSGrid doesn't align with that. So either OSGrid is not a 
</I>&gt;<i> valid/sustainable use case for OpenSim or there's something wrong with 
</I>&gt;<i> that unwritten assumption. In my infinite tolerance towards variety, and 
</I>&gt;<i> given the empirical evidence here, I'm leaning towards the latter (i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> there's something wrong with that assumption).
</I>
Unfortunately I am not too familiar on how OSGrid works but I can 
explain how it could work with the scenario I described where we have 
quite many separate services.

In this case a user would login to a region with separate locations of 
the user's inventory, a list of links to group memberships, a link to 
the user's profile and so on.

The region would then ask an authorization manager to get access to 
these resources on behalf of the user. The user will then be asked with 
a list of services the region wants access to and on &quot;ok&quot; this access 
will be granted in form of OAuth access token which can be used to 
perform signed requests to these services. (the concept of the auth 
manager needs to be developed as mentioned).

So in this case the region can only access a user's data after getting 
those tokens. If this &quot;ok&quot; is given automatically though security will 
obviously be lacking.

Now many regions could be grouped into one region domain which might 
mean that they e.g. provide some mapping services and they could maybe 
use shared access to that data.

In the case of a region domain consisting of regions operated by 
different providers this of course means that a rogue sim indeed could 
get access to that data. But in general I don't see a solution here 
unless you really give each sim access upon visiting. Which of course 
would be annoying.

&gt;<i> Yes, OSGrid, as is, will always be extremely vulnerable towards insider 
</I>&gt;<i> rogues; technically, it's impossible to secure OSGrid's UGAIM servers 
</I>&gt;<i> from malicious sims connected to it. But so what? Maybe people want it 
</I>&gt;<i> like that, maybe the OSGrid community wants to perform human 
</I>&gt;<i> surveillance instead of applying technical solutions such as the 
</I>&gt;<i> Hypergrid (once it's matured). Should we stop supporting that use case?
</I>
I think in the case of a grid which is operated by many people and you 
don't want just a shared map but also shared access for convenience 
there is not much left for kicking out rogue domains. In fact a user 
might not know that it's a bad sim when entering it anyway so even in 
the case of a confirmation on each crossing that sim would probably gain 
access.

(Moreover I think bad clients is the more likely case of e.g. content 
theft).

&gt;<i> If we continue to support the existence of grids like OSGrid, then we 
</I>&gt;<i> need to think what it means for the users to visit such grids, and how 
</I>&gt;<i> they can visit them securely -- that's all I'm trying to figure out.
</I>
They should at least be made aware that there is not one entity running 
it you can sue (well, I don't know the TOS so I don't know if you 
actually could sue somebody).

PS: I know that the OAuth stuff is far away from what would be possible 
right now as it would also mean quite some changes to the client, I am 
mostly mentioning it for discussion purposes and because those are 
standards which are on the rise right now.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not at all.  I think the debate is more about how the architecture will move forward in the future.  As you know,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asset/inventory access, hypergrid), which can be better secured for a robust distributed virtual environment.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OSGrid may want to consider at some point whether it wants to migrate or switch to other architectures once these have

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; As I zoom in on issues of trust and security, I'm getting to the point

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; a map/lookup service and a user accounts service?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; a) nothing more than that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; b) a trust domain
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; If we choose b) then we need to think about OSGrid-like grids. How can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; we trust that a collection of regions administered by different people
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; will behave? Can OSGrid-like grids survive without ToS being signed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; between the grid operator and the region operators? What if the ToS is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; such that it delegates to the region admins any liability on bad things
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; happening in their regions? -- that leaves the user with no central
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; authority to complain, which is as good as not having a trust domain.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; If OSGrid-like grids (i.e. no contracts, or very loose ones; just a map
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; service) are to exist, then it's clear that b) doesn't hold in general.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; It means that there can be grids that are simply a collection of regions
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; that come together in virtual space, but whose trustworthiness as a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; whole doesn't exist.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; The Hypergrid is specifically designed to cross trust boundaries. Should
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; the OSGrid-like grids become HG-ed sims that share the same map, and let
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;grids&quot; be, fully, trust domains?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; You may think I'm getting into philosophy, but this is critical for the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; technical work I'm doing right now related to authentication,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; server-side vs client-side authority, etc. If we can assume that a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;grid&quot; is a uniform trust domain with a central authority, things will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; be simpler in many ways. If not, things will be a bit more complicated.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; Thoughts?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think that you could adopt b) without having a philosophical problem 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with OSGrid.  I would say that even the 'loose
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> contracts' on OSGrid are a form of trust.  If someone were to abuse that 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> trust then I be very surprised if they were not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> removed from the grid.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If OSGrid wanted better security by not sharing the current central 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> services then perhaps they could stipulate that new
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> regions had to connect by Hypergrid rather than the current model (once 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the various gaps in Hypergrid are ironed out)?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Then, in a sense, all the directly connected regions becomes a large 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hypergrid node in the federation that makes up OSGrid.
