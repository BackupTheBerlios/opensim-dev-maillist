I think that you could adopt b) without having a philosophical problem with OSGrid.  I would say that even the 'loose 
contracts' on OSGrid are a form of trust.  If someone were to abuse that trust then I be very surprised if they were not 
removed from the grid.

If OSGrid wanted better security by not sharing the current central services then perhaps they could stipulate that new 
regions had to connect by Hypergrid rather than the current model (once the various gaps in Hypergrid are ironed out)? 
Then, in a sense, all the directly connected regions becomes a large Hypergrid node in the federation that makes up OSGrid.
