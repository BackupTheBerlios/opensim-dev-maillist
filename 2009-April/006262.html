I should make it clear that the idea that there may be advantages for an &quot;oral tradition&quot; may well only be my personal 
pov - it might be that as a group we don't have much written down simply because people hate writing documentation :)

I think the goal of a development process in this context is maintaining maximum flexibility to change and evolve the 
'processes' in response to the evolving situation.  For instance, I would observe that at the beginning of an open 
source project, the barriers to entry are often very low, since any contributions are welcome in the struggle for 
survival.  As a project grows up then it has the opportunity to start to build out the vision of its founder, which I 
think means deciding what kind of things is &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot;.  In this case, Darren's (MW's - our founder) vision was of a 
generic 3D platform which can be customized to different configurations via modules, as stated on our front page.

If you write down these 'processes', I think that you do inhibit the ability to evolve as the situation evolves.  But 
that's at the cost of increasing the uncertainty and nervousness of the very people who would build custom 
configurations.  So to fulfill the vision, one could argue that we do now need a touch more stuff written down.

I would say that the situation is different in commercial projects for lots of reasons, as they differ markedly from our 
situation.

Anyway, all this is very philosophical spouting and getting further than further from any serious technical discussion. 
  We can carry on this conversation by other means, though I'm pretty certain other people have already explored these 
topics more intelligently and in more depth than I have :)
