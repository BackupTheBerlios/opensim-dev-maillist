<PRE>I think we already have an understanding of what is needed for securing 
  users from malicious hosts: client-side control, that's all. Client 
has direct control over user agents, user's inventory, IM, social 
network, etc. The regions stay out of it, they are only simulators of 
objects and agents. Grider is exploring that design space, and 
instrumenting OpenSim for it. We're very close to having OpenSim support 
these kinds of clients.

However, in some cases, the user may want to give control, at least 
some, to the ... and this is where terminology gets tricky... 
simulators? &quot;grid&quot;? And why would that be, you may ask. Well, because 
that server-side (not to get into the choice of words again) may provide 
some cool stuff if you pass it the control. It may, for example, give 
you an additional world-specific inventory, or it may open agents for 
you in interesting 3d spaces, or you won't be able to play whatever game 
is going on in there unless the server-side has control over some of 
your data.

But even this is *sortof* relatively simple to do, IF we align the 
concept of VW with the concept of trust domain. OSGrid, however, doesn't 
do that. So what would it mean for a user to visit OSGrid? With which 
server would the user's client share authority, if it were to share it?

</I>&gt;<i> of what needs to be secured against what sort of action.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've seen way too many talks/chats/posts/blogs talking about a Web of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> VWs in some form, while making the unwritten assumption that the concept 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of &quot;grid&quot; (aka Virtual World unit, or whatever you want to call it) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aligns with the concept of a domain of trust (i.e. a bunch of simulators 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that trust each other, under the control of one authority). Then, a Web 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of VWs is the interconnection of those domains of trust.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, OSGrid doesn't align with that. So either OSGrid is not a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> valid/sustainable use case for OpenSim or there's something wrong with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that unwritten assumption. In my infinite tolerance towards variety, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> given the empirical evidence here, I'm leaning towards the latter (i.e. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there's something wrong with that assumption).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately I am not too familiar on how OSGrid works but I can 
</I>&gt;<i> explain how it could work with the scenario I described where we have 
</I>&gt;<i> quite many separate services.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this case a user would login to a region with separate locations of 
</I>&gt;<i> the user's inventory, a list of links to group memberships, a link to 
</I>&gt;<i> the user's profile and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The region would then ask an authorization manager to get access to 
</I>&gt;<i> these resources on behalf of the user. The user will then be asked with 
</I>&gt;<i> a list of services the region wants access to and on &quot;ok&quot; this access 
</I>&gt;<i> will be granted in form of OAuth access token which can be used to 
</I>&gt;<i> perform signed requests to these services. (the concept of the auth 
</I>&gt;<i> manager needs to be developed as mentioned).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So in this case the region can only access a user's data after getting 
</I>&gt;<i> those tokens. If this &quot;ok&quot; is given automatically though security will 
</I>&gt;<i> obviously be lacking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now many regions could be grouped into one region domain which might 
</I>&gt;<i> mean that they e.g. provide some mapping services and they could maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> use shared access to that data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of a region domain consisting of regions operated by 
</I>&gt;<i> different providers this of course means that a rogue sim indeed could 
</I>&gt;<i> get access to that data. But in general I don't see a solution here 
</I>&gt;<i> unless you really give each sim access upon visiting. Which of course 
</I>&gt;<i> would be annoying.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, OSGrid, as is, will always be extremely vulnerable towards insider 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rogues; technically, it's impossible to secure OSGrid's UGAIM servers 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from malicious sims connected to it. But so what? Maybe people want it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like that, maybe the OSGrid community wants to perform human 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> surveillance instead of applying technical solutions such as the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hypergrid (once it's matured). Should we stop supporting that use case?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think in the case of a grid which is operated by many people and you 
</I>&gt;<i> don't want just a shared map but also shared access for convenience 
</I>&gt;<i> there is not much left for kicking out rogue domains. In fact a user 
</I>&gt;<i> might not know that it's a bad sim when entering it anyway so even in 
</I>&gt;<i> the case of a confirmation on each crossing that sim would probably gain 
</I>&gt;<i> access.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Moreover I think bad clients is the more likely case of e.g. content 
</I>&gt;<i> theft).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we continue to support the existence of grids like OSGrid, then we 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to think what it means for the users to visit such grids, and how 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they can visit them securely -- that's all I'm trying to figure out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They should at least be made aware that there is not one entity running 
</I>&gt;<i> it you can sue (well, I don't know the TOS so I don't know if you 
</I>&gt;<i> actually could sue somebody).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -- Christian
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS: I know that the OAuth stuff is far away from what would be possible 
</I>&gt;<i> right now as it would also mean quite some changes to the client, I am 
</I>&gt;<i> mostly mentioning it for discussion purposes and because those are 
</I>&gt;<i> standards which are on the rise right now.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We need to start by considering that OpenSim splits the asset storage

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Are we saying that OSGrid is doing something problematic and pertubating

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> philosophical discussion. As I see the whole situation, OSGrid is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> testing the mainline trunk SVN from OpenSim in a manner consistent with 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the desires of the community.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Not at all.  I think the debate is more about how the architecture will move forward in the future.  As you know, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> regions on OSGrid have to be pretty trustworthy so as not to abuse the central grid services.  This classic architecture 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> won't go away, but it might be that active development and research switches to other architectures (e.g. client side 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> asset/inventory access, hypergrid), which can be better secured for a robust distributed virtual environment.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OSGrid may want to consider at some point whether it wants to migrate or switch to other architectures once these have 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> matured further.  I doubt that this maturity is all that imminent.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, I'm probably putting words into Diva's mouth now.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; a) nothing more than that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; b) a trust domain
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; If we choose b) then we need to think about OSGrid-like grids. How can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; we trust that a collection of regions administered by different people
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; will behave? Can OSGrid-like grids survive without ToS being signed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; between the grid operator and the region operators? What if the ToS is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; such that it delegates to the region admins any liability on bad things
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; happening in their regions? -- that leaves the user with no central
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; authority to complain, which is as good as not having a trust domain.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; If OSGrid-like grids (i.e. no contracts, or very loose ones; just a map
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; service) are to exist, then it's clear that b) doesn't hold in general.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; It means that there can be grids that are simply a collection of regions
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; that come together in virtual space, but whose trustworthiness as a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; whole doesn't exist.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; The Hypergrid is specifically designed to cross trust boundaries. Should
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; the OSGrid-like grids become HG-ed sims that share the same map, and let
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;grids&quot; be, fully, trust domains?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; You may think I'm getting into philosophy, but this is critical for the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; technical work I'm doing right now related to authentication,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; server-side vs client-side authority, etc. If we can assume that a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;grid&quot; is a uniform trust domain with a central authority, things will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; be simpler in many ways. If not, things will be a bit more complicated.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; Thoughts?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think that you could adopt b) without having a philosophical problem 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with OSGrid.  I would say that even the 'loose
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> contracts' on OSGrid are a form of trust.  If someone were to abuse that 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> trust then I be very surprised if they were not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> removed from the grid.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If OSGrid wanted better security by not sharing the current central 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> services then perhaps they could stipulate that new
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> regions had to connect by Hypergrid rather than the current model (once 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the various gaps in Hypergrid are ironed out)?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Then, in a sense, all the directly connected regions becomes a large 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hypergrid node in the federation that makes up OSGrid.
