<PRE>I know i'm pretty much a newcomer to this scene, but i'd like to throw 
my two pence into the midst.

First of all, i'm not a big fan of beaurocracatic discussions about the 
theory behind &quot;what a grid is&quot;; principally because we're not building a 
grid, we're building a platform - a platform which may have reaches far 
different from any scopes and concepts which we individually may retain.

One thing which really provoked a reaction from me in Melanie's response 
was this: 

 &quot;being forced to share asset and inventory servers&quot;

Is that really such a bad thing? I have to be honest, I have not met a 
single person in second life, OSgrid, reactiongrid, openlife, k-grid, 
who has said to me &quot;You know what, what we really need is asset 
segregation and to make content harder to find.&quot;

Here's my viewpoint, in a summary.

- Security is a good thing.  Real security, as in, stuff which prevents 
attacks, helps to keep the grid stable, etc.

- Please let's not provide a platform which promotes segregation. If 
you're really looking for the definition of a &quot;grid&quot;, i believe there is 
a definite conflict of interest with this approach.

- Let's look to the future, and not base the way we think on constructs 
already in place. No matter committed you think we are to the &quot;linden 
designed protocol&quot; - things can change in a matter of days.

- I can easily predict the availability in the future of &quot;asset farms&quot; 
which are linked in to multiple grids.  I think this is the right 
approach, please don't push things in the other direction.

</I>&gt;<i> regions needs trust between them.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As I zoom in on issues of trust and security, I'm getting to the point

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a map/lookup service and a user accounts service?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a) nothing more than that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b) a trust domain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we choose b) then we need to think about OSGrid-like grids. How can 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we trust that a collection of regions administered by different people 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will behave? Can OSGrid-like grids survive without ToS being signed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between the grid operator and the region operators? What if the ToS is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such that it delegates to the region admins any liability on bad things 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happening in their regions? -- that leaves the user with no central 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authority to complain, which is as good as not having a trust domain.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If OSGrid-like grids (i.e. no contracts, or very loose ones; just a map 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> service) are to exist, then it's clear that b) doesn't hold in general. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It means that there can be grids that are simply a collection of regions 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that come together in virtual space, but whose trustworthiness as a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whole doesn't exist.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The Hypergrid is specifically designed to cross trust boundaries. Should 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the OSGrid-like grids become HG-ed sims that share the same map, and let 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;grids&quot; be, fully, trust domains?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You may think I'm getting into philosophy, but this is critical for the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technical work I'm doing right now related to authentication, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server-side vs client-side authority, etc. If we can assume that a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;grid&quot; is a uniform trust domain with a central authority, things will 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be simpler in many ways. If not, things will be a bit more complicated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thoughts?
