<PRE>Well... I rather suspect we are all headed for the same place, but, ... we seem to be having some semantic 'challenges' lately.

I *know* that all the hearts are in the right place on this list and that all we have to do is be understanding and supportive of each other.

The thing that has gotten us this far has been a trust in each other. For two years now, we have used the software development strategy of 'just work on what your passion tells you'. And it has gotten us a long ways down the path.

Now,... we are having a modicum of success *and* the investment of all in terms of time and servers has gotten significant. So,... we are *all* (myself included) getting anxious whenever we perceive our 'use case' *or* our part of the creation of OpenSim feels threatened.

Anyway, .... 


Laissez Les Bon Temps Roulez!

&amp;&amp;

Create what your passion dictates!

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Development models (was Re: The essence of &quot;grid&quot;)

 If we want to watch the birth of a so-called Web 3D, welcome Diva and
welcome Hypergrid. 
If we want to have a clone of SL, but with the option of different
grids, welcome all development aid, including Hypergrid, as this is
also a dream of LL. 
But if we only want to have a bad clone of
the SL in standalone, we can stop the development now, nothing more is
needed to have a game for some hours. 

For me I support and
I want to watch the birth of the Web 3D, I already attended the birth
of
the web, even before that, I work with some BBSs, then I went to the
web 2, and I do not want to lose the opportunity and maybe I am not the
onlyone, from the inside wanting to attend the birth of the future Web
