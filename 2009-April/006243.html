<PRE>And you're being argumentative just to do it.

Look, OpenSim at least initially was all about the LL grid.  Without a
client to access the simulator all the shiny server bits aren't terribly
useful.  And there have been a number of starts at other clients. For
the most part however people who connect to OpenSim do it with a LL or
derived viewer.

If the LL protocol stuff ends up in a forge module (because the
framework can handle that level of separation) I'd be perfectly ok with
that.  People will use OpenSim for a variety of projects from running
production traffic (today very likely based on a LL or derived viewer)
to futuristic exploration (like Hypergrid). That's a pretty wide set of
use cases to support. I care more about the process than a specific
product (other than that I can make my product using the framework and
have some semblance of success at it). 

My argument FWIW wasn't about a specific protocol. It's about how it
evolves successfully to support the widely varied use cases OpenSim is
being applied to. Hence the change in subject line.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Justin, thanks for clarifying the process. And I certainly understand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the interest in Hypergrid and the energy behind it. Charles your message
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was also helpful in highlighting to me what is at the center of my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concern.  I agree the development process is somewhat chaotic and things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get hacked in based on interest.  That's probably completely to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expected though it may not make for the best platform going forward.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Using Hypergrid as an example,my preference would be to do it outside of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; core. So let me explain that.  Something like Hypergrid is going to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; require a different usage model from the original core (different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocols for &quot;teleporting&quot;, now the exploration around inventory, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rather than have the changes to handle that get introduced into core I'd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have preferred to see something like an RFC that documents what is being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposed, and what &quot;interfaces&quot; need to be changed in order to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accommodate the new use cases.  That RFC gets iterated and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interfaces evolved to make &quot;hypergrid&quot; possible as a pluggable module.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Over time most likely the set of commonly used modules grows and you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ultimately end up with a core framework and a &quot;core&quot; set of modules that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; define what the out of the box functionality of an installation is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (standalone, hypergrid, what have you).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The obvious problem with this approach is that it requires evolving the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; core framework which is not nearly as &quot;sexy&quot; as hacking in new features.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've done both approaches.  Certainly a cool demo can go a long way to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sell a concept and often the change the framework process takes enough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time that prototypes don't happen. It's more work to maintain a branched
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; copy of core while you evolve your prototype into a set of changed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interfaces that support it.  Personally I believe that more disciplined
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approach is the key to seeing OpenSim get to 1.0. And ultimately be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; better platform for experimentation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I like the concept of hypergrid.  I think prototypes like that need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to exist if only to prove that the community is healthy. But I also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believe that how the &quot;framework&quot; is defined and evolves is equally if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not more important (to me at least). 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just my 2 cents.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; direction that's inevitably going to progress most.  If people coming along contributing code that enhances different 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; architectures, then development will also be driven in that direction.
