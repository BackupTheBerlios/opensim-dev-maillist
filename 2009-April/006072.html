&gt;<i> Now on to tags - trunk, branches and tags are really all one thing: paths. The only real difference is by convention: there is a certain path called /trunk that serves a certain purpose, nemaly to be the focal point for developers. There is a certain name used for paths other than trunk, and that is &quot;branches&quot;. Some branches by convention aren't meant to be modified, but serve as snapshots of a point in time - they are called &quot;tags&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But to the server, they are all revisions along differerent link paths. There is really nothing stopping you from committing to a tag - it's just the svn client will be reluctant to do so, as it's aware of the convention.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Keep this in mind, when referring to a 'revision' - it might be on a totally different path, so be sure to mention what path you're really talking about. specifying &quot;trunk, between revision 1343 and 1780&quot; or &quot;0.6.2 post-fixes, between revision 1764 and 2006&quot; again lets you compare revision numbers to indicate advancement of state.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, don't tell people to check a certain revision out, unless you mean _exactly_ that version - tell them the logical path to it instead.

Related to this, I just pulled together a script that will build a
source release (both .zip and .tar.gz) for all tags in the repository,
and dump them at <A HREF="http://dist.opensimulator.org.">http://dist.opensimulator.org.</A>

This is now running under cron hourly, so will pick up a new tag release
 pretty quickly.  This is *not* picking up the fix branches, mostly
because that opens the question of &quot;which version of fixes are being
used&quot;.  However, given that this means source releases magically appear
shortly after tags, I'd recommend just tagging off 0.6.4.1-release,
0.6.4.2-release, etc when fixes go in that should release to the world.
