<PRE>Another thought I had is the creator of the item can add a note card to the
contents of a prim that has a specific name like &#147;_License&#148;.  Then only
allow the creator of this note card to remove it.  The creator of the prim
and the creator of the note card would be the same creator name.  Any
attempts by anyone else to remove it would be ignored.  If this prim is
given to someone else, even if the object is full perms, the new owner will
not be able to remove this note card.  

 

But not sure how much this will really do since anything that is modify or
full perms can be copied and a new item made with a new creator except for
no mod scripts.

I have an idea that is probably a bit on the hackish side, and I'm not sure
it would without some experimentation but I believe it could work without
any modifications to the LL viewer.

 

Create a notecard containing the license information desired and name it
&quot;License&quot;. Save the notecard. Now take the UUID for the notecard and paste
it into the description field of the asset you want it to apply to. Opensim,
noting that the notecard is named &quot;License&quot; and is created by the same
person who created the asset, subsequently attaches that UUID to the asset
in a separate database field, and clears the description field of the asset,
allowing the description to be used for other purposes. When the asset is
transferred, the asset and the notecard are both given to the recipient in a
unique folder. Since the UUID is associated with the asset internally to
OpenSim and not directly accessible from the viewer, subsequent transfers of
the asset would always include the notecard.

 

There may be some problems that I haven't considered with this approach,
hopefully the community can comment and improve it or come up with
alternatives.

I think attaching license information to inventory entries in the database
would be a simple enough tweak. Getting the viewer to display that
information is a good deal harder.

Any suggestions on that matter I am welcome to hear - the better if it
doesn't require us to modify client code.

</I>&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i while ago i went over the legal side of many aspects with 2 lawyer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since this is a multinational question and in many cases has not
</I>&gt;<i> exampels
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. no judgments by court) it tends to be a discussion based on
</I>&gt;<i> personal
</I>&gt;<i> flavor, but not legal facts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And yes, maybe there is enough mud for the whole 3D web.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But to come to the point:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - I don&#180;t know any country, where having the ability to add a
</I>&gt;<i> hypergrid-aware note about the creator and a license (hint, url,
</I>&gt;<i> notecard)
</I>&gt;<i> would have negative impact
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - I know a few countrys where it would realy help from legal side
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - it would be a clear sign, that the opensim crew takes care about
</I>&gt;<i> content
</I>&gt;<i> rights and ownership
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And yes, this only is another brick in the wall of copyright
</I>&gt;<i> protection. We
</I>&gt;<i> still have RL laws, we still need secure technical system, rights
</I>&gt;<i> management
</I>&gt;<i> etc etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And spoken in sex beds, I am more afraid about the pure mass von
</I>&gt;<i> animations
</I>&gt;<i> etc - a few more notecards don&#180;t worry me to much.   :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So - if it is possible somehow, please add it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just my 2 cent...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Ralf

</I>&gt;<i> Won't this also force grids to do what SL do and forbid users to
</I>&gt;<i> transfer
</I>&gt;<i> their accounts/log in details to someone else (and hence all their
</I>&gt;<i> inventory)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why do I get the feeling that we are starting to wade in mud?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can't all the issues of permissions, i.e. the three future (next owner)
</I>&gt;<i> permissions, and the extra two current permissions (anyone can copy,
</I>&gt;<i> anyone
</I>&gt;<i> can move), and licensing, all be dealt with in the TOS of the
</I>&gt;<i> individual
</I>&gt;<i> grids, which then apply to all users of that grid, both creators and
</I>&gt;<i> end-users?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you imagine the mess of an object with multiple textures, filled
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> various anims, scripts and notecards (thinking sexgen bed here), and
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> all have different permissions/licenses. Doesn't bear thinking about :(
