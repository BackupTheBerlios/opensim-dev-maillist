<PRE>These concerns are valid but technically unfounded. There is absolutely 
no plans to remove what's already in OpenSim. There is simply the plan 
to add more and generalize what's already in there. Whenever possible, 
generalization is desirable; whenever the possibilities diverge, we add 
more options that co-exist without being generalized.

&gt;<i> Justin, thanks for clarifying the process. And I certainly understand
</I>&gt;<i> the interest in Hypergrid and the energy behind it. Charles your message
</I>&gt;<i> was also helpful in highlighting to me what is at the center of my
</I>&gt;<i> concern.  I agree the development process is somewhat chaotic and things
</I>&gt;<i> get hacked in based on interest.  That's probably completely to be
</I>&gt;<i> expected though it may not make for the best platform going forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using Hypergrid as an example,my preference would be to do it outside of
</I>&gt;<i> core. So let me explain that.  Something like Hypergrid is going to
</I>&gt;<i> require a different usage model from the original core (different
</I>&gt;<i> protocols for &quot;teleporting&quot;, now the exploration around inventory, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> Rather than have the changes to handle that get introduced into core I'd
</I>&gt;<i> have preferred to see something like an RFC that documents what is being
</I>&gt;<i> proposed, and what &quot;interfaces&quot; need to be changed in order to
</I>&gt;<i> accommodate the new use cases.  That RFC gets iterated and the
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces evolved to make &quot;hypergrid&quot; possible as a pluggable module.
</I>&gt;<i> Over time most likely the set of commonly used modules grows and you
</I>&gt;<i> ultimately end up with a core framework and a &quot;core&quot; set of modules that
</I>&gt;<i> define what the out of the box functionality of an installation is
</I>&gt;<i> (standalone, hypergrid, what have you).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The obvious problem with this approach is that it requires evolving the
</I>&gt;<i> core framework which is not nearly as &quot;sexy&quot; as hacking in new features.
</I>&gt;<i> I've done both approaches.  Certainly a cool demo can go a long way to
</I>&gt;<i> sell a concept and often the change the framework process takes enough
</I>&gt;<i> time that prototypes don't happen. It's more work to maintain a branched
</I>&gt;<i> copy of core while you evolve your prototype into a set of changed
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces that support it.  Personally I believe that more disciplined
</I>&gt;<i> approach is the key to seeing OpenSim get to 1.0. And ultimately be a
</I>&gt;<i> better platform for experimentation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I like the concept of hypergrid.  I think prototypes like that need
</I>&gt;<i> to exist if only to prove that the community is healthy. But I also
</I>&gt;<i> believe that how the &quot;framework&quot; is defined and evolves is equally if
</I>&gt;<i> not more important (to me at least). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just my 2 cents.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> architectures, then development will also be driven in that direction.
