<PRE>Resulting from several test i did over time, i would believe most oft he
&quot;memory leak&quot; dicussed are caching.

There are some, sure.   And there are version with bigger ones, sure.

But running on trunk since October on a nice amount of region - there is no
big problem.

I would even like to see 48h or 72h hour cache - since people are not every
day online.

I have plenty ram free on my server.  Others may be short on resources, so
making it configurable in opensim.ini would be great - even for testing.


Besides that, my experience is that people often talk about high ram usage -
but don&#180;t calculate their needs bases on prim, regions, scripts etc.  as
well, often people think prim is prim - wich is not my experience. The
larger, the more complex the prim is - the more ram. 

they assume, that the usage ~10 minutes after start is what should be
&quot;regular usage&quot; and all above is a memory leak.

Cheers,
Ralf

I think this may have to do with the asset texture cache.   It might
be worthwhile in the future to reduce it from 24 hours down to
something a bit less permenant.
