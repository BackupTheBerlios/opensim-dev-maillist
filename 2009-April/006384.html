I would just note that we've been here before in list history and a significant number of us want to retain the existing 
in-process services for various use cases.  Look through the mailing list for the previous discussion.

That being said, if someone wants to produce a 'remote API' based single sandbox executable then please go ahead.  I'm 
sure that if it's demonstrated to work just as well as the in-process services then fewer people would object to switching.
