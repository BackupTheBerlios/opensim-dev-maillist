<PRE>I think we need a different term. The &quot;grid&quot; as it exists today is more 
concerned with mapping regions than anything else; any trust domain or 
resource sharing that exists seems to me to have emerged as a side-effect 
of the necessities of co-location. We should abandon the grid and move 
toward federalism.

I don't see any reason why notions such as trust, co-location, asset sets, 
or anything else should necessarily be anything other than loosely 
coupled, independent, federations. I think this would encourage a more 
minimal approach to what constitutes a simple region implementation 
(looking outside for all of the &quot;services&quot; it requires apart from perhaps 
a local region database.

I do agree with the view that assets and inventory are user-centric, and 
any asset dependencies in a region are consequential, diverse, and not 
necessarily managed by the region at all.

Best regards
Alan

Re: [Opensim-dev] The essence of &quot;grid&quot;



I'm happy to see others are sharing my vision. :)

That is just what i think needs to happen:

Users becoming independent entities who use a inventory and asset 
space provider of their choice, even self-hosted if they have the 
bandwidth.

Regions service local assets themselves, so there is no nee for 
continuous access and authorization to the user's asset services 
just to render content.

Grids being like websites, as trust domains binding regions together 
that share a common pool of local resources (assets).

And the HG letting us travel freely between them, and comms being 
simply out of scope for regions, handled between comms provider 
networks and the client.

&gt;<i> see some as being utility asset services hosted by entities with

&gt;<i> regions for the management of local/near assets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And, I see connected groups of regions based around specific themes, 
</I>ideas
&gt;<i> or goals. Destinations that allow or disallow travel to a user based on
</I>&gt;<i> policy set by the connecting entity. Not necessarily  providing a user
</I>&gt;<i> service, but rather a consumer of the user service. Not necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> providing an asset service, beyond servicing local needs. But, more of a
</I>&gt;<i> consumer of the widely distributed asset services. The policy may 
</I>require a
&gt;<i> registration before allowing the user, and may allow or disallow entry 
</I>based
&gt;<i> on a set of preset criteria.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, user/group centric messaging services that span the infrastructure 
</I>to
&gt;<i> allow users and groups to communicate, offer teleports and inventory to 
</I>each
&gt;<i> other regardless of their location.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we think in terms of openness and distributed services that provide a

</I>to
&gt;<i> develop. And, if we think of  a grid as a UGAIM with a bunch of

&gt;<i> regions backed by a hall of lawyers and a bank, we don't get too far.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First of all, i'm not a big fan of beaurocracatic discussions about the

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One thing which really provoked a reaction from me in Melanie's

&gt;&gt;<i> was this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;being forced to share asset and inventory servers&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is that really such a bad thing? I have to be honest, I have not met a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single person in second life, OSgrid, reactiongrid, openlife, k-grid,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who has said to me &quot;You know what, what we really need is asset
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> segregation and to make content harder to find.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here's my viewpoint, in a summary.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Security is a good thing.  Real security, as in, stuff which prevents
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attacks, helps to keep the grid stable, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Please let's not provide a platform which promotes segregation. If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you're really looking for the definition of a &quot;grid&quot;, i believe there 
</I>is
&gt;&gt;<i> a definite conflict of interest with this approach.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Let's look to the future, and not base the way we think on constructs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already in place. No matter committed you think we are to the &quot;linden
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designed protocol&quot; - things can change in a matter of days.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - I can easily predict the availability in the future of &quot;asset farms&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which are linked in to multiple grids.  I think this is the right
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approach, please don't push things in the other direction.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I believe that, for technical purposes, a &quot;grid&quot; should indeed be

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and bending it to anything else would be very painful and not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; entirely successful, feature-wise. The Linden-designed protocol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; elements are best suited to that situation, and the HG ones are best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; suited to untrusted connections.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; OSGrid really does straddle the fence in many respects, but I think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it will change over time and become HG connected rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; grid-structured. The server-centric region handoff system doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; allow for any level of content protection and being forced to share
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; asset and inventory servers is no longer needed in the new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; architecture that Diva and I hashed out last night.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; We would, indeed, arrive at a secure Hypergrid, and a true 3d
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; internet, much sooner if we made that distinction and considered a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;grid&quot; as we know it today a trust domain.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  From that follows:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Region = Webpage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Grid = Website
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Hypergrid = Internet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The operator of a complex, multipage website needs trust between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it's pages, and so the operator of a complex HG site with many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; regions needs trust between them.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a map/lookup service and a user accounts service?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; b) a trust domain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If we choose b) then we need to think about OSGrid-like grids. How

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; we trust that a collection of regions administered by different

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; such that it delegates to the region admins any liability on bad

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; happening in their regions? -- that leaves the user with no central
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; authority to complain, which is as good as not having a trust 
</I>domain.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If OSGrid-like grids (i.e. no contracts, or very loose ones; just a

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; service) are to exist, then it's clear that b) doesn't hold in 
</I>general.
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It means that there can be grids that are simply a collection of 
</I>regions
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that come together in virtual space, but whose trustworthiness as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; whole doesn't exist.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The Hypergrid is specifically designed to cross trust boundaries. 
</I>Should
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the OSGrid-like grids become HG-ed sims that share the same map, and 
</I>let
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;grids&quot; be, fully, trust domains?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; You may think I'm getting into philosophy, but this is critical for 
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; technical work I'm doing right now related to authentication,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; server-side vs client-side authority, etc. If we can assume that a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;grid&quot; is a uniform trust domain with a central authority, things 
</I>will
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; be simpler in many ways. If not, things will be a bit more 
</I>complicated.
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Thoughts?
