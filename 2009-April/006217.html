<PRE>About the status of the Hypergrid.

The hypergrid is being redesigned so that it can be made mutually safe 
for users and for the sims they visit. The &quot;safe&quot; hypergrid is heavily 
client-side based. I haven't had much time to write documents, but ppl 
can look at the very few things I have here:
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Grider">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Grider</A>
(and I know some of the devs know exactly what's going on, so no need to 
explain (excuses, excuses :-). Melanie gave a great explanation in an 
earlier email)

This is the only way to achieve safety for everyone in a web of VWs, so 
instead of improving the current version of the Hypergrid, which is 
heavily influenced by the server-side dominance in OpenSim/Second Life, 
we need to do this right.

It's more important to protect people's inventories, for example, than 
to fix the appearance issues in the current Hypergrid. Once the 
client-based Hypergrid is in place, all of those issues will be 
naturally fixed.

(The brave in here can try out Grider -- just get the latest zip file 
(0.1.4) and try it logging in to sims running with -hypergrid=true. You 
won't see much of a difference, but things are done through completely 
different procedures, all controlled by the client.)

</I>&gt;<i> So, from the most basic point, we can say that our current and most

</I>&gt;<i> able to HyperGrid to a different grid and have that avatar and inventory 
</I>&gt;<i> stay reasonably constant. That is, the avatar should not be ruthed.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But, I think it all begins with a desire for a consistent avatar and 
</I>&gt;<i> inventory experience while HyperGridding.
