Wonderful job, Diva. I think we're onto something here.

 

&gt;<i> &gt; - &quot;Simulator trust domain&quot;: a set of simulators that trust each other, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; operated by one single authority
</I>

Sounds fine; akin or parallell to an 'estate' perhaps?

 

I propose the entity &quot;Resource Services&quot;: A set of zero or more services serving resources for regions. Resources include:  assets, user accounts, and assorted services like lookup services,  forums, etc.

 

&quot;Grid&quot;: a set of simulators that share &quot;Resource services&quot;.  [And this is the thing] A Grid includes one *or more* 
 simulator trust domains.


&gt;<i> &gt; - &quot;Hypergrid&quot;: the interconnection of grids.
</I>

Am I correct in assuming that the hypergrid then boils down to the &quot;untrusted&quot; connections? What is left, basically.


&gt;<i> As a small point, the &quot;Grid&quot; definition would appear to mean that our current 'Standalone' mode is confusingly also a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Grid&quot;. Is there a suitable alternative term to &quot;Grid&quot; for this definition? I've run into this problem myself when 
</I>&gt;<i> writing about OpenSim. I keep having to using unclear formulations such as OpenSim installations.
</I>

I have always said that we should talk about &quot;Services&quot; not &quot;Servers&quot;. The trust is established between services, and the standalone is a &quot;Grid&quot; trust boundary in itself.


&gt;<i> Also as a small suggestion, it might be helpful to write this in a glossary on the wiki somewhere so we can point back 
</I>&gt;<i> to it. I think ages ago someone started a general one but I wouldn't be surprised if it has been buried by now.
</I>

+1
