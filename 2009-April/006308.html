</I>
I think that's basically the idea behind many of the proposals. You have 
some relationship manager which holds has associations to all the 
services you use. You then only authorize that relationship manager to 
give out tokens to some third party on your behalf. This then can be 
automatic or you might choose to being asked each time you teleport.
I yet have to understand the details of ProtectServe but it seems to be 
something along those lines based on OAuth. Additionally I think they 
also handle contacts between those services so that you can define in 
detail which service has access to what data. But I am not sure on this 
point right now.

&gt;<i> If you want to see how this key request/verification process currently 
</I>&gt;<i> works in OpenSim, take a look at 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim/Framework/Communications/UserManagerBase -- at the very end of 
</I>&gt;<i> that file.
</I>
Will do (but tomorrow, getting late here).

&gt;<i> Those keys are sent along authenticated requests, like for example
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim/Framework/Communications/Services/HGInventoryService
</I>&gt;<i> This particular service then establishes a bunch of CAP URLS for secure 
</I>&gt;<i> access to inventory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Service discovery is another matter, I think. For starters, we can 
</I>&gt;<i> assume that the user explicitly specifies the URLs of the services it 
</I>&gt;<i> uses -- so that service catalogue you mentioned -- in his/her ID server.
</I>
What exactly is the ID server? And if you have some sort of server then 
I guess it would be easy to write some web frontend to create some XRDS 
or XRD file, after all it's rather simple XML. (Some OpenID or XRI 
providers even let you edit your XRDS file already).

&gt;&gt;<i> The reason I like OpenID and OAuth is that it will allow in the future 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to manage a limited set of identities properly. There is no need to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> create yet another account with profiles etc. on each service. This is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also very much where the discussions in the social networking space are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> heading right now and it would be great if I can reuse the same things 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in OpenSim, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You don't need OpenID redirects to do this. You login directly with your 
</I>&gt;<i> ID service.
</I>
Well, that means though that I am bound to that service and probably 
need yet another login/password to remember.

But I think in general the best would be a flexible authentication 
architecture where the user can choose between different mechanisms, be 
it OpenID, simple username/password, an InformationCard/CardSpace 
approach or the SSL solution. What the user support could also be stored 
in the XRD file and what the service supports could be stored in the 
service's XRD file (as you can of course use the same concept for 
checking on the services a region provides, much like GridInfo).
