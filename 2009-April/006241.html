<PRE>Hello,

you're basing your argument on a flawed assumption.

OpenSim's purpose is NOT to be a SL clone. It is to be expected that 
OpenSim will evolve away from the LL model in significant ways, 
possibly even before 1.0.

If your desire is to duplicate the LL grid, you can likely still do 
it, and in the future you may need additional modules, which may be 
on forge.

Hypergrid is certainly core, because Hypergrid is what the core team 
sees as the future. SL compatibility is still a focus, but is 
largely understood as a stepping stone into the next generation web.

Therefore, you may well find a &quot;walled garden&quot; forge module in the 
future.

</I>&gt;<i> was also helpful in highlighting to me what is at the center of my
</I>&gt;<i> concern.  I agree the development process is somewhat chaotic and things
</I>&gt;<i> get hacked in based on interest.  That's probably completely to be
</I>&gt;<i> expected though it may not make for the best platform going forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using Hypergrid as an example,my preference would be to do it outside of
</I>&gt;<i> core. So let me explain that.  Something like Hypergrid is going to
</I>&gt;<i> require a different usage model from the original core (different
</I>&gt;<i> protocols for &quot;teleporting&quot;, now the exploration around inventory, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> Rather than have the changes to handle that get introduced into core I'd
</I>&gt;<i> have preferred to see something like an RFC that documents what is being
</I>&gt;<i> proposed, and what &quot;interfaces&quot; need to be changed in order to
</I>&gt;<i> accommodate the new use cases.  That RFC gets iterated and the
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces evolved to make &quot;hypergrid&quot; possible as a pluggable module.
</I>&gt;<i> Over time most likely the set of commonly used modules grows and you
</I>&gt;<i> ultimately end up with a core framework and a &quot;core&quot; set of modules that
</I>&gt;<i> define what the out of the box functionality of an installation is
</I>&gt;<i> (standalone, hypergrid, what have you).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The obvious problem with this approach is that it requires evolving the
</I>&gt;<i> core framework which is not nearly as &quot;sexy&quot; as hacking in new features.
</I>&gt;<i> I've done both approaches.  Certainly a cool demo can go a long way to
</I>&gt;<i> sell a concept and often the change the framework process takes enough
</I>&gt;<i> time that prototypes don't happen. It's more work to maintain a branched
</I>&gt;<i> copy of core while you evolve your prototype into a set of changed
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces that support it.  Personally I believe that more disciplined
</I>&gt;<i> approach is the key to seeing OpenSim get to 1.0. And ultimately be a
</I>&gt;<i> better platform for experimentation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I like the concept of hypergrid.  I think prototypes like that need
</I>&gt;<i> to exist if only to prove that the community is healthy. But I also
</I>&gt;<i> believe that how the &quot;framework&quot; is defined and evolves is equally if
</I>&gt;<i> not more important (to me at least). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just my 2 cents.
