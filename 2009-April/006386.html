<PRE>There is nothing wrong with the in-process (local) services, and I think 
they should stay. They're as much services as the remote ones, and are 
quite handy for standalone grids. I hate having to track N different 
processes.

This is all a matter of finding the right *vocabulary*, which usually 
means having a good model in place for what's going on, and the right 
mechanism to support it.

If we start looking at OpenSim as a sort of service-oriented 
architecture, then it's clear that the issue of which processes host
which services is a configuration issue, not an architectural one.
