<PRE>Clearly changing process now isn't appropriate.  There sounds like a
plan and I'd +1 moving forward with it. 

I'd be willing to invest time in release coordination *if* we can add
some structure to how thats done going forward.  So for my part I'd +1
to the approach being discussed and doing the refactoring necessary to
gain the modularity proposed.  The release process can be a separate
topic of discussion.
