<PRE> It may seem that by supporting as many of these as possible its making the
task easier for the  client, but I believe making a very generic version of
option C, allowing each region to be customised to require varying levels of
protection and pushing back the ease off use issue to the client would make
the task simpler for opensim AND give the client the freedom to choose.

For example you can attach multiple logins to an im messenger application or
an email client, and use all of them seemlessly from one computer, so the
viewers should be able to store grid / region passwords and manage them,
allowing for strict password protection even on a region basis yet seemless
useage / teleporting / walking for the client.

I've been debating with myself and with some ppl in IRC about whether
OpenSim should support many security schemes or shoot for the most generic
one. Advice appreciated. Here's the situation.

There are already 3 different authentication schemes on the pipeline for
Teleports, one of them being the current one, and two being on my local
non-committed changes. These 3 schemes are: (a) no authentication; (b)
session authentication; and (c) key authentication (keys being unique,
one-time strings for each client-server pair).

(a) is what is currently in place -- hence my nagging about the lack of
security in non-VPN'ed grids. But for VPN'ed grids this is perfectly fine.
(b) is a weak form of authentication that prevents spoofing from the outside
of a grid, but that doesn't prevent spoofing from inside. That is, regions
can find out the sessionID of users when they're logged in, and impersonate
them. In open grids this is highly unsafe; but in walled-garden grids, this
is perfectly fine.
(c) is the strongest form, as it allows clients to have a lot more control
-- not the raw Linden client, which doesn't quite do that, but others. (c)
can also be implemented in the current setup, with the raw Linden client,
and with server-side teleports. It's kind of meaningless in this case, but
it's no worse than (b) for open grids.

So, back to the original question. Should OpenSim support all of these and
more, or should we shoot for (c) only?

The corollary being that multiple implies some clever software 
architecting...

(c) is the most important; there is a very well established pattern
using SSL, there should also be many libraries for this

Well, if a key is an arbitrary string, then it may also be a 
constant UUID value, e.g. the standard session id we have now, so 
(c) really includes (b).

Now, my vision of the future 3d internet is that all grids will be 
walled gardens, trust domains, as an analog to a large, multi-server 
website. I see people move between those trust domains using the 
Hypergrid protocol and client side teleporting. I see people use 
nonlocal messaging (Jabber, etc) instead of local grid comms.

Therefore, I believe the ability to run a trust domain with 
hypergrid ability should be maintained, we should not mandate that 
all protocols in all cases must assume untrusted regions, because I 
see those in the hypergrid, rather than the local grid in the future.

Hypergridding between these trust domains, I believe, must involve 
the target domain's user server, which would, in the case of (c), 
negotiate the key with the viewer.

So, for now, (c) is the way to go, just don't forget the (b) use 
case. Interregion trust should remain possible.

</I>They are very different. A key is specific for one client-server pair. 
So for each region the client visits there is a unique key that the 
other regions might not know about. When TPs are performed on the 
server-side, this is equivalent to (b) because the regions are acting on 
behalf of the agent. But for client-side Teleports, this makes all the 
difference -- the regions don't know about the other regions' keys.

</I>Right. Even though my main focus is the Hypergrid, I'm a little 
reluctant in letting go of (b), and even of (a). The problem I'm 
debating is how to architect OpenSim so that these different schemes can 
co-exist without the code and configuration being a mess.

If we're going to do it 'right' from the start, then obviously, (c) as the
general case and (b) as the special case should be the way to go.

 

(Easy for me to say)

 

And on a tangent, I'm closing in on having the AssetServer demanding a
connection to a user server to resolve user urls. Thoughts?

 

(It baffles me we don't seem to have that already - I'm not working on the
AssetInventory server as I feel its ultimate destiny is still somewhat
hazy?)

I have now updated the wiki with the proposal, linking to 

 

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_2005">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_2005</A>

 

from the main page. Please read article and add to it.

 

On the page I have stated that 0.6.5 be the last version building on VS
2005. Ideally, I'd like to tag that now, and then introduce a VS 2005
'breaker' to really get things going.

 

Do we have a 0.6.5-rc1 rev?

Subject: [Opensim-dev] Proposal: Drop VS 2005 suppost [Was: C# 3.0 vs .Net

I propose that
 
&quot;if nobody actually objects on this or the users list before 1st of May
2009, we'll drop VS 2005 support and move on&quot;.

If I get no strong objections on this, I'll re-post a proposal and update
the wiki with the proposal and guidelines to objecting, on friday 3rd of
April 2009.

You may find some issues with that since it?s a CTP (pre-beta) from 2006, so
some supported syntax in there may have changed for final release, but can?t
say for certain. 
 
Teravus is correct in that VS2008 is available for free
(<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/">http://www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/</A>). Installing C# 2008 Express you
also get SQL Server 2008 Express installed, so you have some options for
using that out of the box too. C# Express should be able to handle most
basic development tasks ? I guess it just depends on how nice you want to be
to 2005 Pro or higher owners going forward as to whether to stay in 2.0 land
or move on.

Could anybody actually using VS 2005 comment on whether installing the Orcas
CTP would solve this?
