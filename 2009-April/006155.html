I'd agree with Mel here about lets keep it a bit more open and sloppy
for now, and start to lock that down once we're on the other side of the
loader issue.

We all come to this from different perspectives.  Mine is a lot of scars
and lost time due to IScriptHost a year ago.  Just about every LSL
commit required changing IScriptHost and adding back in functions for
SOP.  Eventually, I just threw out IScriptHost, as it was clear that
interface was far too premature.

I think we're a bit premature on IScene at this point.  We know what we
all would do with it, but leaving the barn door open to other random
folks abusing the interfaces in ways that we didn't expect is probably
reasonable at this stage, so we make sure we don't lock off a piece of
function that's very reasonable to want.

That being said, breaking Scene into more digestable parts would be a
*very good thing*.
