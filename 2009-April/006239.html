Mike, nobody is going to prevent people from running walled gardens, as it's a valid use case in many scenarios.  If we 
did somehow come to a point where we had to make a choice, then this would have to be subject to a proper proposal which 
makes it clear what functionality is being removed.  But I should think that Hypergrid development can go forward 
without that happening.

But I do have to also point out that OpenSim development is largely driven by the interest of the developers (since 
there's no single company behind it).  If there's a lot of development interest behind Hypergrid then this is the 
direction that's inevitably going to progress most.  If people coming along contributing code that enhances different 
architectures, then development will also be driven in that direction.
