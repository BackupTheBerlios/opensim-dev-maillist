Indeed, that was part of my initially written long reply I wrote
yesterday, but I fell back to try to more clearly define the problem
scope first before solving it :)

There are various problem statements, and they require different
approaches of varying complexity. if the consensus is that the core
code should have some &quot;framework&quot; functionality - then it would be the
least common denominator between the cases - so the best approach
would be to try to anticipate all the possible things the folks would
like to solve, and then make up the base that would be compatible with
all of them.

thanks,
andrew
