<PRE>I have had this discussion with Adam and Lbsa in the past.

The OpenSim equivalent to SecondLife's AgentDomain is our UserServer. 

So, the &quot;trust domain&quot; is the UserServer executable on a given grid.

Now, it may be incomplete, but that is the direction we have been going for the last two years.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] The essence of &quot;grid&quot;

 Finally someone to explain in brief what is &quot;trust domain&quot; and is
precisely what we need. We need to create something that the grids and
regions connected by
hypergrid can behave as &quot;trust domain&quot; 
Cristina got 100000% of reason in your security considerations for
links between grids and regions. 
Melanie, thanks for the help given by your post.

In the future, the avatar and his inventory will be independent of 
the grid. This is already almost a reality.

To address another post, a &quot;trust domain&quot; doesn't imply that the 
visitor trusts it. It merely means that all regions within it trust 
each other. Like the servers that make up a web application.

Backing up a bit, I think we need to start with the fact that a grid provides a common start point for an avatar logon. By that, I mean, a grid will have some quantity of users in the users MySQL or MSSQL table with a particular avatar appearance and some semblance of an inventory.

For the purpose of HyperGrid, many folks wish to travel from grid-&gt;grid, standalone-&gt;grid, standalone-&gt;standalone or grid-&gt;standalone. And most of those folks will expect to have their avatar appearance constant based on their original logon place as they HG around.

So, from the most basic point, we can say that our current and most reasonable use case is an avatar with custom edits and some inventory that logs onto a particular standalone or grid and then expects to be able to HyperGrid to a different grid and have that avatar and inventory stay reasonably constant. That is, the avatar should not be ruthed.

In order to accomplish this in the general case is a bit tricky and I believe is one of the issues being worked on currently. A number of other things begin falling out of this notion after this one is working reliability and consistently such as the other things brought up in this thread. 

But, I think it all begins with a desire for a consistent avatar and inventory experience while HyperGridding.
