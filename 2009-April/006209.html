<PRE>Thank you, Michael, for a good and objective description. I would concur with your points.

As we move forward, we also have to consider that economic considerations come into play in the notion of &quot;personal trust&quot; and &quot;software trust logic&quot;.

There are folks already using both V$ (VirtualWallet) on some OpenSim regions and grids. Other folks are using vendor scripts with external web site connections in browsers. So, delivering goods and services in a reliable manner with currency transactions will have a significant effect on both notions of trust.

Charles

</I>&gt;<i> To me, a Grid is a virtual space that can be of any given size, and to 
</I>&gt;<i> date, currently consists of one or more discrete Regions that are laid 
</I>&gt;<i> out in a two dimensional grid pattern.  A Grid allows for these 
</I>&gt;<i> discrete individual spaces to be joined together to provide a seamless 
</I>&gt;<i> virtual space that viewers can traverse as if they were a single large 
</I>&gt;<i> simulation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A Grid can consist of just a single Region, or many Regions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Within a Grid, it may be desirable to assign ownership of virtual 
</I>&gt;<i> space to specific agents for administration.  Those agents, through 
</I>&gt;<i> their viewers (or other means) should be able to determine who may 
</I>&gt;<i> enter their space, what those visitors can do once there, including 
</I>&gt;<i> what communications are available and what objects they may simulate.  
</I>&gt;<i> Currently we determine areas of administration in 256m^2 regions of 
</I>&gt;<i> space, that are then sub-divided by parcels.
</I>Oh, and I forgot to mention, I fully expect to see Grids of Grids  -- in 
fact, OSGrid could be seen as a grid of grids.  It consists of many 
individual Regions of space, that can on their own be considered a grid.

I'll state it again here, for those that don't care to read my other 
longer rambling message -- each instance of OpenSim is to a certain 
extent a self contained grid.  In standalone mode it has nearly all the 
same services as what is currently called a &quot;Grid&quot; -- and those services 
that are missing could be added.  In fact, &quot;Grid Mode&quot; is simply the 
delegation of specific subsets of responsibility to another entity.
