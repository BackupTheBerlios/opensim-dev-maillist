<PRE>Thanks for this clarification Sean. I am learning more all the time about
revisions/trunks better.

&gt;<i> Now on to tags - trunk, branches and tags are really all one thing: paths.
</I>The only real difference is by convention: there is a certain path called
/trunk that serves a certain purpose, nemaly to be the focal point for
developers. There is a certain name used for paths other than trunk, and
that is &quot;branches&quot;. Some branches by convention aren't meant to be modified,
but serve as snapshots of a point in time - they are called &quot;tags&quot;. 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But to the server, they are all revisions along differerent link paths.
</I>There is really nothing stopping you from committing to a tag - it's just
the svn client will be reluctant to do so, as it's aware of the convention.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Keep this in mind, when referring to a 'revision' - it might be on a

talking about. specifying &quot;trunk, between revision 1343 and 1780&quot; or &quot;0.6.2
post-fixes, between revision 1764 and 2006&quot; again lets you compare revision
numbers to indicate advancement of state.
&gt;<i>

</I>_exactly_ that version - tell them the logical path to it instead.

Related to this, I just pulled together a script that will build a source
release (both .zip and .tar.gz) for all tags in the repository, and dump
them at <A HREF="http://dist.opensimulator.org.">http://dist.opensimulator.org.</A>

This is now running under cron hourly, so will pick up a new tag release
pretty quickly.  This is *not* picking up the fix branches, mostly because
that opens the question of &quot;which version of fixes are being used&quot;.
However, given that this means source releases magically appear shortly
after tags, I'd recommend just tagging off 0.6.4.1-release, 0.6.4.2-release,
etc when fixes go in that should release to the world.
