<PRE>See invitation. Any ideas before I talk to him? I can propose him 
anything; I can tell him to make a panel, a talk, invite the whole 
group, whatever. Let me know who is interested and what you think is 
best, by tomorrow preferably.

Thanks.

Hi Christa,

thank you very much for your email. I do remember you well and you were 
on list of people to contact about this and beat me to writing you :)

You may have seen from whoever alerted you to Metaverse U that this 
conference will have a focus on open virtual world platforms so an 
Opensim presentation would be great. I have pasted my usual blurp below 
in case you haven't seen it.

You may also be interested in the new Sirikata 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.sirikata.com%20">http://www.sirikata.com%20</A>&gt; platform I am involved with. We are very 
open to collaboration with Opensim as well.

Do you have some availability to talk on the phone about all these things?

Henrik


The blurpy thing:

On May 29th and 30th my group is putting on the second iteration of 
our Metavese U conference &lt;<A HREF="http://metaverse.stanford.edu/">http://metaverse.stanford.edu/</A>&gt;. The main 
purpose of this conference is to define a strategy for advancing open 
source virtual world platforms and explore their potential in a broad 
variety of contexts, including scientific research, education, private 
enterprise, and cultural programming. Our mission statement is as follows:

/The Metaverse U conference will explore the cutting edge applications 
of virtual worlds and the open platforms that drive them. 
/
We are using sponsorships to keep the cost of attendance down to $50 for 
two full days of conference. Should this present a barrier to anyone 
then let us know and we will figure it out. We also realize that not 
everyone who should be a part of this conversation has the opportunity 
to make it to Stanford so we plan to have a free live video stream for a 
remote audience. 

We are in the process of building the agenda with speakers and topics. 
There is still lots of room for your input so please write us with any 
ideas you may have. For the right speaker we would also consider remote 
options.

We plan to open registration around mid April and have lots of 
announcements coming so watch <A HREF="http://metaverse.stanford.edu/">http://metaverse.stanford.edu/</A> for updates.

Hope you can make it!

Cheers,

Henrik

    Hi Henrik,

    We meet about a year ago at a workshop at NASA about virtual worlds,
    not sure if you remember me. Last year I couldn't go to the
    conference you organized, but this year, I think I might, if there
    is interest in talking about OpenSim (<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/">http://opensimulator.org/</A>).
    I've been on sabbatical this year, 100% dedicated to OpenSim and
    applications with it. If you're still looking for ideas for
    sessions/panels/etc I would like to propose one of those about OpenSim.
    Let me know.

    Regards,
    Crista
