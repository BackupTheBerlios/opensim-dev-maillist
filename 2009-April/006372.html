<PRE>Melanie,

I'm gonna take you on your volunteering to create a skeleton, just like 
you did the other time :-) I'm willing to do the extra work of carrying 
around 2 monolithic architectures, along with a configurable one, as 
long as we can plug them in.

I'll need your help with all the things that this will break, like the 
master avie stuff.

</I>&gt;<i> Also, region modules can reference each other even when in spearate 
</I>&gt;<i> DLLs. So, one packager may want to put LocalComms and GridComms into one 
</I>&gt;<i> DLL and not expose any config, while another one may put local comms 
</I>&gt;<i> into a dll itself and not ship grid comms at all. yet another may make 
</I>&gt;<i> separate DLLs and ref local services in grid services.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I have an interface in Scene that allows multiple region 
</I>&gt;<i> modules to share an interface - the script engines use it. Region 
</I>&gt;<i> modules are infinitely flexible there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, we don't need
</I>&gt;<i> ILocalUserService
</I>&gt;<i> IGridUserService
</I>&gt;<i> IHGUserService
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> all we need is
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IUserService
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Each of the stacked modules can then decide whether it is it's call or 
</I>&gt;<i> not. That would be via strings in config, as it is for other region 
</I>&gt;<i> modules now. As done in permissions, I have found new semantics to call 
</I>&gt;<i> events with return values as well, where I can harvest all return 
</I>&gt;<i> values, not just the latest. There is a lot more flexibility in all of 
</I>&gt;<i> this than has been used up to now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be happy to talk about how and create skeletons for this as well.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OK, let me backtrack. There are really two separate issues going on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a) One issue is the means by which we specify different service 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connectors. The dlls + entry class is the right way. Unfortunately, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that isn't in place yet, and I'm not sure I'm the right person to do 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it :-/
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b) Another issue is whether Local/OGS1/Hypergrid are really 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternatives in the true sense of the word, just like MySql is an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternative to SqlLite, or ODE is and alternative to Bullet. I don't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think they are; I think they are generalizations, in that precise order:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OGS1=Local+more (you can see this in the dependencies)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hypergrid=OGS1+more (again, see the dependencies)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Being generalizations, one can simplify things by having the most 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general model, and configuring it to obtain the more specific 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behaviors. (This is independent of how we split the model physically)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, I guess I'm torn here. On the one hand, I can see how things would 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improve dramatically if we had a plugin thing really going, whatever 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plugin thing that would be.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the other hand, the plugin thing doesn't exist, and I don't see it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the horizon anytime soon. We're stuck with having to define 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behavior by configuration variables, instead of dlls. Hence my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> original proposal, which did *not* include specifying dlls.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [I'm having the same feeling I had just before I did RESTComms... so 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this may very well end up going Melanie's suggestion of region modules 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> again... or I'll just give up trying to fix this in general, and focus 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the much narrower things that matter to me which are the security 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configurations for the hypergrid -- the hell with OGS1]
