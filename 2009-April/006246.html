<PRE>Then do it in your own repository and push changes back to &quot;core&quot; when
they're baked enough and have been reviewed.  Lots of good examples of
that development model in open source projects.  Though perhaps Justin
is right that there's not enough people in core to support that.  

I hear of lots of &quot;side&quot; projects in this space all the time so I
suspect there really is sufficient critical mass to do this. Just a lack
of will. 

In the interest of following my own advice I'll write up a proposal that
states the model I think makes sense given the current maturity of the
project.  If it gets shot down fine, at least then the case was made.
