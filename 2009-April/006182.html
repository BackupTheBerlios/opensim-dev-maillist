Definitely.  I've spent quite some time moving things out of Scene myself.  Much of what remains are the much more 
indigestible bits (e.g. land/terrain management, inventory).  I plan to look at these in the course of my normal 
attempts to chip away at the big ball of mud but any help here would be much appreciated.

Switching the region module mechanism seemed to me to be a good opportunity to introduce a Scene interface without 
causing a separate bout of pain later on.  But on hearing some of the rational feedback, I accept that it could still be 
too early to do this.  If people were to treat this interface as a contract they could build against, as Teravus pointed 
out, then it needs to be stable.

Nonetheless, I'm seeing that with the exception of Melanie, the core developers who have posted are in favour of having 
an interface eventually (I presume before 1.0).  So it is coming and if people have to endure some update pain later on, 
well that's the price of building against alpha code.  It's not a huge upheaval either, in most cases it is simply a 
search and replace of Scene with IScene.  When this happens later on I will point back at this discussion as warning.

I'm quite happy to hear arguments against a scene interface, but I will forcefully counter and later ignore any attempt 
by Melanie to bully me off the point with completely exaggerated statements.  We're here to discuss, negotiate and 
compromise in good faith, not to shout at each other across the mailing lists.
