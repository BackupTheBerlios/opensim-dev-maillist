&gt;<i> Well, you /could/ use hashing to define the license text, but honestly? A URI works better. Really, just making it complicated in order to have a UUID really isn't ideal.

</I>thought more - and my hashing idea was pretty bad in a sense that it
did not solve the problem completely.

but i think what might be happening is that everyone has different
class of the problem in mind, in which case we could discuss for quite
a long time ;)

is the problem:

a) &quot;thank you for making your purchase. Oh by the way - if you don't
wipe your butt with this texture, would be awesome&quot;.
b)  &quot;why are they suing me ? these textures chased me themselves!
honest! which textures you are talking about ?&quot;
c) { c = malloc(5); strcpy(c, &quot;sale&quot;); give_to_user(c); strcpy(c,
&quot;rent&quot;); go_to_court(c); }
d) &quot;oh Ms. $Hollywood[rand()], we are sorry our user giving out your
nude photo, no, if you sue we are bankrupt&quot;
e) &quot;hmmm did this guy _really_ build this texture he is selling? looks
too good compared with the rest&quot;

A couple of those I made from theoretical examples in the paranoid
head, the rest I tried to summarize my understanding of others'
posts... and those have varying requirements, so would it be useful to
give a 160-character description per each one that is missing in he
above list ? then we could see what's the scope of the &quot;Licensing
support&quot; issue and how it could be chopped down into chewable pieces ?

Of course, if all everyone wants is the extra field in the DB and
firing up the browser with that URL each time the asset crosses
&quot;hands&quot;, that's would be my last mail on the subject :)

cheers,
andrew
