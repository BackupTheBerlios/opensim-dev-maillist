<PRE>Right.
This whole issue can be formulated in one very simple question:
If the client is to delegate authority to the server-side, should it do 
it to the specific simulator or to this other server that speaks for a 
collection of simulators, aka &quot;grid&quot;?

Under the Apache model, the answer is &quot;to the specific simulator&quot; which 
then can get its response from some other server, if it wishes to do so. 
But in a lot of discussions related to webs of VWs, there is an implicit 
assumption that there needs to be this other controller with which the 
clients have to interact.

As I said, this is not philosophy. As I'm doing Grider, I need to decide 
with which server it interacts for purposes of authority delegation. I 
think it should interact with specific simulators. But I just wanted to 
shake things a bit and see what's out there in people's minds, 
specifically for this concept of what a &quot;grid&quot; is.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To me, a Grid is a virtual space that can be of any given size, and to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> date, currently consists of one or more discrete Regions that are laid 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out in a two dimensional grid pattern.  A Grid allows for these 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discrete individual spaces to be joined together to provide a seamless 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> virtual space that viewers can traverse as if they were a single large 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simulation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A Grid can consist of just a single Region, or many Regions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Within a Grid, it may be desirable to assign ownership of virtual 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> space to specific agents for administration.  Those agents, through 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their viewers (or other means) should be able to determine who may 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enter their space, what those visitors can do once there, including 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what communications are available and what objects they may simulate.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Currently we determine areas of administration in 256m^2 regions of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> space, that are then sub-divided by parcels.
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and I forgot to mention, I fully expect to see Grids of Grids  -- in 
</I>&gt;<i> fact, OSGrid could be seen as a grid of grids.  It consists of many 
</I>&gt;<i> individual Regions of space, that can on their own be considered a grid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll state it again here, for those that don't care to read my other 
</I>&gt;<i> longer rambling message -- each instance of OpenSim is to a certain 
</I>&gt;<i> extent a self contained grid.  In standalone mode it has nearly all the 
</I>&gt;<i> same services as what is currently called a &quot;Grid&quot; -- and those services 
</I>&gt;<i> that are missing could be added.  In fact, &quot;Grid Mode&quot; is simply the 
</I>&gt;<i> delegation of specific subsets of responsibility to another entity.
