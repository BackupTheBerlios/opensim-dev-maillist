<PRE>&quot;I would even like to see 48h or 72h hour cache - since people are not 
every day online.&quot;

Correct me if I'm wrong but after the sim processes and crunches the 
images to whatever specs the client requests doesn't the client then 
keep the image and prim data in its own cache on the local disk?  If so 
then why hold on to it in the server's memory for so long unless you're 
expecting a high volume of first time visitors or ones with a clean cache? 

For example in my case we have one server set aside to handle new users 
and hypergridders. On that same server we also have our inventory 
library which holds quite a large volume of prim inventories such as 
texture sets, clothing, etc.  For that one I can understand a 24 hour or 
longer cache time in order to accommodate a high volume of first time 
visitors and those pulling from the library's prim inventories.

On the rest of our servers however we have all the different roleplay 
environments which are likely to be frequented more by our existing 
users.  For these, since most of the visitors would already have the 
scene in their local cache it doesn't seem make all that much sense to 
hold anything in the sim's cache for longer then say an hour or two in 
order to accommodate the few new users and hypergridders that may pop by.

I wonder if maybe instead of hard coding the cache time if it would 
perhaps make more sense to place it in the ini file as a tweak-able setting?

Thanks, :)
