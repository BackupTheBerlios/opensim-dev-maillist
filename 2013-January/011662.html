<PRE>Not all of the users of OpenSimulator are sysadmins. Have you ever worked
in a corporate environment? Often the computers that people use are managed
by a central IT department and deviating from the long-term supported IT
mandated solution is not allowed. Similar situations exist in education.
OpenSimulator is not necessarily designed for the sole benefit of a few
for-profit grids, in fact, much of the code base has been contributed by
people who use *and develop* it in such restricted environments. This is
true for content development as well.

Likewise, not all of the contributors have a large R&amp;D budget. For some,
upgrading to the latest and greatest is not an option, in fact, it could
disable other applications they need to use a shared computer for. Some of
these users have contributed major functionality to the code base. As
stewards of the code base, we need to keep the needs of *all* users in
mind. These are some of the reasons these traditions exist.

</I>&gt;<i> Mono 2.10 would make it harder for non-technical people to run OpenSim then
</I>&gt;<i> there would have been some (small) justification for holding back on
</I>&gt;<i> advancing OpenSim. However, to do so in order to save sysadmins from
</I>&gt;<i> upgrading their outdated distros is putting the needs of the very few above
</I>&gt;<i> those of the great majority of OpenSim users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Delaying advancement of a software project that is labeled Alpha for the
</I>&gt;<i> stated reason places enterprise-level legacy support requirements on an
</I>&gt;<i> open-source project that is developed and used by people that have nothing
</I>&gt;<i> preventing them from upgrading their systems (Windows and Mac users have no
</I>&gt;<i> problem using the latest Mono versions as it is). No end-user is going to
</I>&gt;<i> be affected by this upgrade, if any of them is using Linux at home (which I
</I>&gt;<i> doubt more than a few dozen are) then they are likely either using Ubunto
</I>&gt;<i> in the first place and/or are capable of downloading and installing Mono
</I>&gt;<i> from a third-party site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How many people are going to be served by delaying an upgrade to .NET 4.0?
</I>&gt;<i> How many people will have an inferior OpenSim because of that delay?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not that we're preventing anyone from using the existing OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> version. We're just saying that if you want to use the latest version on
</I>&gt;<i> Linux you need to have Mono 2.10 or later installed. If it doesn't come
</I>&gt;<i> with your distro then search for a third-party site that provides it and
</I>&gt;<i> download it from there. People who can't be bothered to doing either one of
</I>&gt;<i> those things can continue using the existing OpenSim version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, let's focus on advancing OpenSim and not on saving some sysadmins
</I>&gt;<i> the few hours it will take them to install and setup Mono and/or a new
</I>&gt;<i> Linux distro on their server(s).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just curious.  Call me crazy and stuff but why are you worrying about

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you are concerned about adopting .NET 4.0 features because someone might

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ok enough ranting.  If you feel that upgrading to the 4.0 .NET apis would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> benefit OpenSim as a whole (I do) then do it.  Deciding what versions of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mono to use and what distribution to use it on are deployment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> considerations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that someone should be considering carefully based on what they want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the software for.  And if they are trying to run anything close to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> production service then they need to be aware of the issues involved in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> various versions of mono and make their choice based on that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I doubt I get a vote but if I did I'd vote to advance the API version of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .NET and pick up the new features therein.  Document the dependencies and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> let people doing deployment sort out the environment that best meets their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requirements.  My 2 cents.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Subject: [Opensim-dev] Raise minimum .net framework version to 4.0 and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mono
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version to 2.8 (with 2.10 strongly recommended) in 2Q2013
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After some further investigation, it turns out that Mono 2.6 does not make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the higher parameter Func calls available unless it has been built in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> special preview mode.  This is not available on at least the Ubuntu Mono
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> package and I suspect most, if not all, of the other distro packages as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Therefore, the minimum version of Mono that will use them is 2.8 (for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> C# 4.0 is the default).  Polling the earliest supported release versions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> various Linux distros, the situation is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Debian 6.0 (squeeze)    Mono 2.6.7
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ubuntu 8.04 LTS         Mono 1.2.6
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ubuntu 10.04 LTS        Mono 2.4
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ubuntu 11.10            Mono 2.10.8.1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ubuntu 12.04 LTS        Mono 2.10.8.1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> openSUSE 11.4           Mono 2.8.2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> openSUSE 12.1           Mono 2.10.6
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CentOS 5                no Mono package
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CentOS 6                no Mono package
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I see Debian squeeze as the sticking point here.  Debian 7.0 (wheezy) will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ship Mono 2.10.8.1 and has been frozen since 2012-06-30.  Debian does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work to release dates so it's impossible to say when it will be released,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though the indications are that it will be in the first half of this year.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even when it is released, Debian squeeze will most probably be supported
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until early 2014.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In light of this, I am going to recommend that we do not update the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minimum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version of Mono until Debian wheezy is released.  We've already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effectively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been living with this situation for a while so I don't think that a bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> longer is going to hurt, though making modInvoke() properly useable is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important.  If wheezy is not released by the time that OpenSimulator 0.7.6
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is here, which I anticipate being shortly after Easter, then we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revisit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the topic.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This means that existing binary packages will continue to be compiled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against .NET 3.5 (though ironically the current 0.7.5-RC packages have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compiled to work with Mono &gt;2.8 only, which will be fixed for the final
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> release).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When the update occurs, everything will compile and run against Mono 2.8
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mono 2.10 will be strongly recommended as the Mono 2.8 series has proved
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> considerably buggy in the past.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once the update is made, the target framework will be .net 4.0 rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .net 3.5.  This will allow c# 4.0 language features to be used and will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> require the Microsoft .NET Framework 4 packages to be installed on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We've already heard arguments both ways so I doubt that it's worth
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rehashing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them.  However, I also think this would be a marginal decision so I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> welcome
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any new points.
