<PRE>Justin,

Simudyne would be willing to donate some funds to help set-up the Overte Foundation. What would you need?

Best,
Justin

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Subject: [Opensim-dev] Built libbullet shared object libraries for Linux but this isn't what you wanted!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Robert.  I briefly putzed around with building shared object Bullet 2.78 under Linux tonight and popped the results
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in as commit 23bf773 on the bulletsim branch.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I just realised that you weren't asking for the bullet libraries to be built.  What you were really asking for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in <A HREF="010271.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/opensim-dev/2011-June/010271.html</A> were Linux/OSX makefiles to build your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BulletSim.dll interfacing library in the opensim-libs svn repo (for which anonymous access is unfortunately not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currently working - this need to be fixed).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That doesn't look too difficult but it's a little more involved for me since it's a long time since I wrote a Makefile.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   I don't know when I might get a slice of time to do that, so I think help from anybody else would still be very much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appreciated.

</I>&gt;<i> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I'm sure everybody on these lists is aware, OpenSimulator currently has some restrictions on who can contribute code 
</I>&gt;<i> to the project (<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Contributions_Policy">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Contributions_Policy</A>).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The most controversial of these is the one that prevents contributions from people who have studied the Linden Lab 
</I>&gt;<i> viewer within the past 6 months.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This policy came about because the early core developers wanted to be very cautious when dealing with a project that was 
</I>&gt;<i> intimately intertwined with OpenSimulator through a common virtual world protocol and concept, but which was licensed 
</I>&gt;<i> under the copyleft GPL license rather than OpenSimulator's BSD license.  It was also inspired by bad, though unrelated, 
</I>&gt;<i> early experiences of unwanted inclusion of GPL code within OpenSimulator.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, this rule increasingly restricts progress and innovation.  To state the obvious, it effectively stops Linden 
</I>&gt;<i> Lab viewer and third party viewer developers from contributing to OpenSimulator and it stops OpenSimulator developers 
</I>&gt;<i> from contributing code to those viewers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We do want to do something about this.  In very broad terms, there are two choices of action.  Either we simply drop the 
</I>&gt;<i> 6 month restriction or we establish a Contributor's License Agreement (CLA) to explicitly clarify that a developer has 
</I>&gt;<i> the necessary rights to contribute the code that they're giving.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Simply dropping the restriction is tempting.  However, the conditions under which it was established have not changed - 
</I>&gt;<i> the core of the Linden Lab viewer and derivatives is still under the copyleft LGPL license.  Some people think that in 
</I>&gt;<i> general such restrictions are entirely unnecessary but others think that it's a reasonable precaution in the absence of 
</I>&gt;<i> a CLA.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the other alternative is to have that CLA.  This is the route that we've started going down.  The proposal is to have 
</I>&gt;<i> a CLA by which a contributor explicitly grants a copyright license over their contributions.  Each contributor will 
</I>&gt;<i> continue to own their own code (i.e. there is no transfer of copyright).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, there is considerable debate over CLAs, with some people seeing them as essential and others thinking that they 
</I>&gt;<i> are entirely unnecessary.  However, many open-source projects have CLAs (Apache, Django, Python, the Linden Lab viewer) 
</I>&gt;<i> so we would not be in bad company.  Having to submit a CLA might also reduce casual 'drive-by' patches, though we would 
</I>&gt;<i> make CLA submitting as easy as possible - by accepting them electronically, for instance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In order to grant a copyright license there needs to be a receiving entity.  To this end, we are in the process of 
</I>&gt;<i> setting up an organisation known as the Overte Foundation.  The Overte Foundation will receive the copyright licenses 
</I>&gt;<i> and become the official distributor of OpenSimulator rather than individual core developers.  This will put it in a good 
</I>&gt;<i> position to deal with code origin or other issues, if any should ever arise.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once the CLA is complete, the current contribution restrictions to OpenSimulator will be removed.  It will be down to 
</I>&gt;<i> each developer (including core developers) to affirm via the CLA that they have the necessary rights over the code that 
</I>&gt;<i> they are contributing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One advantage of going down the foundation route is that it will also be able to promote and support OpenSimulator in 
</I>&gt;<i> other ways, quite possibly incorporating members of the community other than just developers.  The foundation could also 
</I>&gt;<i> extend to cover other open-source virtual-environment/virtual-world projects and components.  In the short term, though, 
</I>&gt;<i> we will be concentrating on establishing the CLA.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At some point soon we would be very grateful for donations to the Overte Foundation in order to deal with some of the 
</I>&gt;<i> costs involved in setting things up and for ongoing support and promotion of OpenSimulator.  Setup costs should not be 
</I>&gt;<i> too high since Ben Esplin of Pillsbury Law is very kindly donating time and expertise (he also helped OSgrid establish 
</I>&gt;<i> their organisation).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We're actually still in the process of setting up the foundation so we'll only be requesting donations once we have a 
</I>&gt;<i> bank account for them.  However, we wanted to get this out in the open now so that people know what is being proposed 
</I>&gt;<i> and so that we can get feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For a much shorter public statement and FAQ about these topics shorn of the historical context, please see
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Foundation">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Foundation</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Foundation_FAQ">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Foundation_FAQ</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will be acting as the first Overte Foundation president, with Diva as treasurer, Melanie as secretary and Nebadon and 
</I>&gt;<i> Ben as initial board members.  The foundation itself will not directly control OpenSimulator development - this will 
</I>&gt;<i> remain with the OpenSimulator team and community as it does now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Discussion about this is very welcome, whether supporting or critical.  I'm logging off now so will likely answer any 
</I>&gt;<i> points tomorrow.  Of course, other core developers are very welcome to chip in.
