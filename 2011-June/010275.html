Got it, you had mentioned before that the viewer would cache 
this.  That explains why it persisted across roll backs of my 
database!  Thanks.  Easily fixed.  My many viewer caches now being 
cleared to get back to a tidy state!

One issue I had was that I have the same avatar name on many grids 
(all with different UUIDs of course).  And for convenience I made 
some of them HG friends for tests. I have now set up a specific new 
name OSGrid avatar for the tests so as not to get this friends name 
and caching issue.

I think going offline across grids is NOT yet pushing through to the 
friends list... do you believe it is?

And off-line messaging for me is definitely not working, Does German 
Grid have Offline IMs Bernd?  If so can you see if its still working 
on the regions you have the new HG Friends/IM enabled?
