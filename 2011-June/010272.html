<PRE>Giving HG Friends/IM testing info here... unless there is a better 
place to report this experience Diva?  I was on IRC and left some 
info there too.

I did find that I had mistakenly used port 8003 for the two new 
connectors for HG Friends and Im in Robust.HG.ini and fixed that to 
make them be port 8002 (accessible outside the firewall) and 
friendship confirmations now appear, and IMs can be sent when avatars 
are online across the Openvue and OSGrids... So that's good progress.

I note a few glitches that I am tracking down now.

a) friends on different grids shows as just te avatar name...The 
friends DB table in MySQL looks plausible showing the friends I set 
up as tests properly and a reciprocal entry for te OSGrid avatar back 
to teh local avatar UUIDs.  So 2X2 entries for 2 local friends to one 
OSGHrid avatar.

b) BUT a friend now made on the SAME grid shows as avatar name @grid 
name.  I checked the friends data base table and there doe snot seem 
to be an old entry in there from the time when I was testing and 
things were partially failing.

c) When an Openvue avatar goes offline, the OSGrid avatar friends 
table continues to show it as online - long after it logged off (15 
minutes or so anyway).  Even when an IM is sent to that avatar and 
the IM window reports user is busy or offline, the friends list 
continues to show that same avatar as online.

d) When I send an IM from OSGrid to a friend on Openvue who is 
offline but indicated as online by friends list), the Robust.exe 
console shows quite a long list of attempts to send the message and 
saying received message from UUID of OSGrid avatar, and unable to 
locate UUID of local Openvue avatar.  I saw one crash of Robust,exe 
while that stream of messages was coming in.  Maybe its trying a lot 
of times too rapidly for Robust?

e) Even simple IMs within Openvue grid between friends now seem to 
use the [HG IM SERVICE] message sending and repeat each part of the 
three step process warning (yellow message) twice (sending, user is 
not present, unable to locate).

f) Offline message delivery has stopped working though I had it 
configures.  is that incompatible or need setting up differently when 
using the HG IM SERVICE?  I see an attempt to retrieve stored 
messages on login but they are not delivered, and on looking at the 
wi_offline_msgs table there are no new messages being queued while 
avatars are offline.

because of the crashes on Robust.exe with my current setup, and I am 
assuming its still something in MY config that is wrong, I have 
reverted back to 0.7.1.1 . Hope this testing and feedback helps get 
this all going for everyone.
