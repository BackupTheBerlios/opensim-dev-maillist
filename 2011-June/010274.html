There's some improvements left to be done. Here's how it works currently.
If you go elsewhere and you meet someone local in range, the sim will 
send the local name to your viewer. From then on, your viewer always 
associates that person's UUID with the name that it got. Friends does 
the right thing, as you saw in the table. So for now, if you want to see 
the correct display, you need to clear the viewer's cache at some point.

&gt;<i> And if you can tell me if offline messaging ising the WI offline.php 
</I>&gt;<i> module is tested as working by anyone after using the HG Friends/IM 
</I>&gt;<i> addins that would be useful, as its stopped working for me just now.
</I>
I don't know anything about offline IMs. I don't think the additions 
have any effect. If others can confirm that it stopped working for them, 
I'll take a look.
