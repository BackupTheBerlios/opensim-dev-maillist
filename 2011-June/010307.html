<PRE>Hey Justin,

When i try to tp to a region with one axis &gt; 64k, the imprudence(1.4) viewer 
returns: 
&quot;Could not teleport. The region you tried to teleport to doesn't exist 
anymore&quot;. 

Latest snowglobe has the same issue. There is no feedback from the simulator 
or robust service besides the search-operation for the region in the map(which 
is ok). It's not that i want to run a large amount of regions, rather i would 
like to combine two map-layers; single os-region tiles with openstreetmap-
tiles, based on their shared grid locations at zoomlevel 17 or 18, which 
require a gridaxis of 2^17. Like if i wanted to create a region on top of some 
location in the netherlands, then it would require a grid-location which is 
larger than 64k at each axis. 

The tile-renderer thats part of hwios now, works for quite some time already. 
It was tested succesfully on os-grid tiles some time ago. It works in 
openlayers, kde marble and in viewer 2(using the mapservice uri, but without 
the osm-layer), but if one can't tp to the regions &gt; 64k in-world, then it 
doesnt make much sense to try to mashup both osm and os.

I tried to avoid the error in the past, by introducing mapping offsets, but 
that would complicate things alot. The use of this 1-1 mapping approach is 
that you always know the rl osm tile thats linked to a region, so you can for 
instance get the osm tile on a 256x256 prim and show where rl roads and 
buildings are supposed to be in-world. If this feature would work, it would be 
possible to introduce a mapping client like marble inside of a viewer, or use 
geodjango on top of hwios for AR-related stuff.

kind regards,

Jeroen
