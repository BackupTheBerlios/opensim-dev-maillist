<PRE>Building Bullet itself is a start. Thanks Justin.

The makefile should be fairly straight forward as there are just the two cpp files and one .h file with the only dependencies being on the std library and Bullet itself. As you now know, Bullet used CMAKE for its build/configuration tool and I don't know if there is a way to link a BulletSim build into it (put the Bullet directory under BulletSim and do a CMAKE which builds both together).

I'm setting up a Linux build environment so I should be able to help anyone working on this by next weekend. I'm doing some stress testing this week and then I will look into linksets again -- I want to get vehicles working.

I was able to pull opensim-libs anonymously last week (<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/svn/opensim-libs">http://opensimulator.org/svn/opensim-libs</A>). Has it broken since then?

Subject: [Opensim-dev] Built libbullet shared object libraries for Linux but this isn't what you wanted!

Hi Robert.  I briefly putzed around with building shared object Bullet 2.78 under Linux tonight and popped the results 
in as commit 23bf773 on the bulletsim branch.

However, I just realised that you weren't asking for the bullet libraries to be built.  What you were really asking for 
in <A HREF="010271.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/opensim-dev/2011-June/010271.html</A> were Linux/OSX makefiles to build your 
BulletSim.dll interfacing library in the opensim-libs svn repo (for which anonymous access is unfortunately not 
currently working - this need to be fixed).

That doesn't look too difficult but it's a little more involved for me since it's a long time since I wrote a Makefile. 
  I don't know when I might get a slice of time to do that, so I think help from anybody else would still be very much 
appreciated.
