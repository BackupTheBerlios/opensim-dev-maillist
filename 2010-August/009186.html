<PRE>I think we should treat this cautiously, but optimistically &#8211; this is a big move for Linden to undertake; it is not quite as significant as a move to BSD would be, but it is a solid step forward and may eliminate our chief concerns, and I am of the personal belief it opens some doors to use as far as contributors co-developing goes.

I would however ask everyone to please hold from examining the code until we&#8217;ve got a legal opinion on the matter, but I am quietly optimistic that this may allow us to remove that clause from OpenSim&#8217;s own contributor agreement.

Regards,

Adam

If I heard Oz and Esbee correctly, the whole of the viewer, with the exception of the proprietary libs they use (which I htink is the KDU jpeg2000 stuff and one or two media codecs at this point) go to LGPL. You can't mix LGPL and GPL deeply, as Adam's pointed out. I'm not enough of a LGPL wonk to know exactly where that takes things. I'd think the question is &quot;does it change the dynamic on &quot;derivative work&quot; I know being LGPL means that one could link bits direclty into OpenSim legally. That's straightforward. What's less obvious is whether reading the LGPL code causes the same issues that
reading GPL code causes. They did point out that they still insist on the contribution agreement, and that the contribution agreement was why they could shift licenses.

It&#8217;ll have to be all LGPL if parts of it are &#8211; since the GPL wont accept redistribution of a mix of LGPL and GPL &#8211; only pure GPL.

Check the post on sldev about it &#8211; it looks to me from that one that the intention is for it all to be LGPL.

As regards to OpenSim contributions, I doubt that the viewer license change to LGPL will make any difference. LGPL just
makes it possible to link non-GPL code to the viewer code. The viewer co
de itself is still virally licensed.
Justin, where did you get this information? Its not the way it was presented at SLCC (I watched the entire announcement and read the postings afterwards by LL). So, its not the way I read it, but we need to check. They even amended the licence from GPL to LGPL for a lot of the top level parts of the viewer source code as I examined some of the key commitdiffs.


&quot;for a lot of the top level parts&quot;? Not the entire code base? I'm curious which parts are now LGPL and which are not, and if not, what license they are under?
