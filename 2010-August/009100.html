<PRE>Can I suggest an approach here... as someone who has spent a LOT of 
time getting something working for our Openvue and adding in 
gradually the functionality as time allows.

I can say that our grid has a small number of users, and that is 
mostly as three attempts to integrate OpensimWI have failed.  Though 
we use offline IM from that useful offering.  We now have Wifi going 
as opf yesterday and I just opened up te grid to the Virtual 
University of Edinburgh members... whereas for 2 years I could not as 
it would need too much manual setup.  To me this is a no 
brainier.  Diva has provided some useful functionality and it is important.

However, there are alternatives like simian grid, d4os, OpensimWi etc 
which provide a lot too.

Can I suggest an approach...

Core should be as small as possible.  Minimum to get running.

Other things ought to look like addons.  Packed in the addons 
directory and separately enableable.  By default if in addon they 
should be OFF. There can be several alternatives, but at LEAST ONE 
for each important function.

- voice
- web front end
- offline IM
- groups
- ?

We should be open to anyone adding alternatives.  But quality control 
means the community ought to use them a while before they get added 
into the main download.  If they date, no problem, they date, and the 
community can decide if and when to remove them from the main 
download... they can still be add ons added separately BEFORE compile 
or released as binary addons with the same directory structure.

Refinement and addons to addone (I think this will apply a LOT to 
wifi which I can see vast potential for) should be available in a 
contributed addons directory.

Looking good guys...  and thanks for all the effort everyone.. and 
Diva for this module.  Name is odd though :-) 4 users today said they 
thought it must relate to something about Wireless Wifi. Wi better?

See our wifi front end at: <A HREF="http://virtual.aiaie.d.ac.uk:8002/wifi">http://virtual.aiaie.d.ac.uk:8002/wifi</A>
