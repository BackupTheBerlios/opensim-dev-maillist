&gt;<i>I'm not sure exactly what you mean.  What do you mean by appearance being loaded each time - to the viewer or updated on the server?

&gt;<i>It's quite possible that something will have changed in OpenSim 0.7 since this incorporates significant reorganizations of code, and I know there were changes to home location handling.  You might have to experiment with this.

Ok, thank you, I meant that when I use the GridClient object from OpenMetaverse to log a bot, and I look at what is happening from my client, the bot is logged as a kind of grey piece of skull before its apperance is loaded (and moreover it is not logged to its last position).

I don't know where this problem is coming from, I guess the appearance is not updated on the server. I have to wait (about 2 minutes) before this piece of grey skull becomes a default appearance avatar. (sometimes, just a part of the avatar is loaded, like only the hair, the eyes...)

Well, thanks you for your answer Justin CC, and if you and anyone is facing this problem or can propose a solution, I would be please to read it. 

Cheers
