That's a gross mischaracterization of what I said.

I said I had no time, and that was fact -- I have a limited amount of 
time to dedicate to this. It was either making the Hypergrid 1.5 come to 
life for real, or engaging in email exchanges that, as interesting as 
they may be, don't produce code. I also said I thought the 
standardization process was premature, given that there were no viable 
reference implementations at the time; not even the Hypergrid 1.0 was 
good enough, and it was the most similar thing to an interoperability 
scheme that we had around. I stand by that -- it was premature. Plus, in 
the beginning, it looked like the goal of VWRAP was to give a cover-up 
of legitimacy to Linden Lab's plans of doing a federation of virtual 
worlds involving Linden Lab and its customers, and I was not interested 
in being a part of that.

Now that (a) Linden Lab is out of the picture, and (b) HG 1.5 actually 
exists, it seems like a perfectly good time to pay attention to 
standards. In my book, standards come after implementations exist, not 
before. I seem to have read that somewhere in the documents outlining 
the workings of the IETF, that it's not intended to design protocols 
from scratch, only to standardize protocols coming from possibly 
competing technologies.

So thank you, others and Linden Lab for setting this working group up at 
the IEFT. OpenSim will soon put forward its technology in the form of a 
concrete proposal backed up by a solid reference implementation.
