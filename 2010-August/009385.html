that's great, but it doesn't require a URL. maybe a data structure
with an optional display name and a URL for the rest of the info.

&gt;<i>

</I>
but you're going to REQUIRE servers to now do a redirect from
&lt;URL&gt;/&lt;old name&gt; to &lt;URL&gt;/&lt;new name&gt;. or you're going to need to stop
treating URLs as opaque data strings.

&gt;<i> The main concern here is to remove the need to look up remote data
</I>&gt;<i> each time a prim is selected.
</I>
are you suggesting that the client magically acquired the data without
looking it up remotely somewhere. URL construction and caching are
orthogonal.

&gt;<i> Also, changing avatar names is something the protocol wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> designed for. The caching involved makes it a very iffy proposition,
</I>&gt;<i> because even the CLIENT caches key-&gt;name mappings. This is why
</I>&gt;<i> renamed avatars in a local grid appear as their old names the
</I>&gt;<i> friends list, while over their heads, they have the new name.
</I>&gt;<i> So, whoever renames avatars gets whet they deserve. Chaos.
</I>
okay. so now you're saying you're going to backfill use-cases to match
your protocol. good luck with that. let me know how that works for
you.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> c. if you want to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.avination.net/user/44626b40-13d6-4817-b61b-de5df7b5e7e8/Melanie+Milland">http://www.avination.net/user/44626b40-13d6-4817-b61b-de5df7b5e7e8/Melanie+Milland</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (or something like it) be that URL, then what happens when i want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> move from avination.net to example.com?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You do not &quot;move&quot;. The URL defines the avatar known as Melanie
</I>&gt;<i> Milland on the avination grid. It will never reference another
</I>&gt;<i> avatar. In this case, avination.net is the identity provider for
</I>&gt;<i> that account and the account exists in this namespace.
</I>&gt;<i> You can't &quot;move&quot;. If you want to _switch_ identity providers, you
</I>&gt;<i> MAY be able to take inventory, etc, with you, but the identity is
</I>&gt;<i> another one. You would no longer be the avatar who created those prims.
</I>&gt;<i> It's like email accounts. You call it &quot;moving&quot; from gmail to yahoo,
</I>&gt;<i> but you don't move, you create a new account and set up a forwarding.
</I>&gt;<i> We may devise a system that handles forwarding, but that depends on
</I>&gt;<i> the original grid still being there. As with the email, if you move
</I>&gt;<i> from gmail to yahoo and gmail were to go out of business, your mail
</I>&gt;<i> addressed to gmail would no longer be forwarded to your yahoo address.
</I>
so if i decide i don't want to trust avination.net, but i do want to
trust example.org, i can't get example.org to redirect to
avination.net?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mixing URLs with URIs isn't the end of the world, but it does make it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difficult to change names or canonical URLs when you mix them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See above. Name changers get what they deserve. Name change is not
</I>&gt;<i> even safe on a local grid. Avoidance of lookups in the 99% case is
</I>&gt;<i> more important than correctly handling corner cases.
