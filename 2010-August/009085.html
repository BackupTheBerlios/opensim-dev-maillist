<PRE>Thanks Diva. I added a potted version of your intro. into 
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Wifi">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Wifi</A>

Karen, I added a bit that can be expanded to cover the alternative 
HTTP port issue.

</I>

I see you structuring your distribution to put Wifi in the add-on 
modules directory which seems right.  If there can be a way to get a 
zip that contained what was required set out in opensim standard 
directory pattern... and a readme to explain what gets added in and 
where.  It could be available from your normal distribution web site, 
like the ImageService dll for example.  the read me could note where 
you have to make changes to enable the module in the standard 
OpenSim.ini.example, Robust.ini.example and Robust.ini.example 
files.  Or those could have them included (like we have for Groups 
and Freeswitch) but like those it would be shown disabled by default.

That would seem to be a good approach?  Notes on the Wiki could 
essentially repeat whatwas in the readme... hence me starting the 
Wiki page to help along a bit.

But personally I think if it could be included with the core it would 
be useful.  Like voice, groups and offline IM, having one solution 
included that works is good.  It can always be replaced by other more 
comprehesive options such as OpenSimWI, SimianGrid and/or d4os
