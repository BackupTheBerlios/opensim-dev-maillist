<PRE>I have different answers than Melanie.

&gt;<i> An open question with this approach is whether you need to use global identifiers when dealing with cross-grid scenarios, or whether there is always enough context to derive a global identifier. Some examples:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * A HyperGrid user is teleporting from grid A to grid B. Does grid B have enough information to build the global identifier &quot;gridA/user&quot;?
</I>
Yes. It already does that on the spot. We don't need persistent global 
identifiers for agents.

The issue we are now talking about is if someone in grid B makes friends 
with this user. In this case, we need to add an entry to grid B's 
Friends service referring to an external user, and vice-versa. That's 
when we need global identifier for this user (not its agent).

&gt;<i> * A HyperGrid user rezzes an object into grid B that exists in their inventory on grid A. The object has a creator that is unrecognized to grid B. Should grid B pull the creator profile from grid A (which may actually be storing a local copy of the real creator identity from grid X)? Note that this isn't a question about trust because we're already trusting grid A to provide creator information for the object, it's just about where we pull profile info from.
</I>
Yes, it should. And since the code that does that is exactly the same 
code that prepares inventory items for archiving, this should be no 
different than archiving itself.

&gt;<i> * An OAR file is loaded and contains an unrecognized identity. Should identities in OAR files be encoded as global identifiers, or a header added to the OAR file to say &quot;all of this content came from grid A&quot;, or the full profiles of all the identities in the OAR embedded right into the archive?
</I>
I don't think it can be bulk in the general case, although that could be 
option in some cases. I'm looking at my inventory right now and it's a 
rainbow of stuff I got from all sorts of places.
