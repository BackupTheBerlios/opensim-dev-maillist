<PRE>Diva (and all of those helping with this piece),

I am delighted to see this discussion unfolding. I fell this functional
'hole' has been crippling opensimulator adoption in many respects for some
time.

That said, I wish to add that for a time I felt rather passionately that
this belonged in core. My passions haven't really abated in that respect,
but will say that I've begun to question my commitment to the idea that it
belongs in core. In explanation, I'd summarize as saying that it's the ready
availability of the functionality to me, in as streamlined a fashion as
possible.

So, I think the way it is resolving for me is that were there to be improved
support for installing and operating so-called 'third party' applications
alongside opensimulator, it would not only address my concerns with respect
to what I feel is a limitation of functionality that is injurious to the
growth of the ecosystem (tip o the tam to JustinCC here), I think that
concern would be addressed in spades with a better (hopefully more
automated) approach to managing our add-in modules, and I would heartily
encourage any efforts anyone was willing to extend along these lines :)

Speaking of support, I am looking forward to this code being pronounced
ready for primetime use -- and as with everything I actively use, you can
count on me to be ready to support it for all comers.

Kudos to you all!

Cheers
James

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I must admit, one part of me would be very happy to see it in core since

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the other hand, I'm always concerned about expansion of core - we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already have 500,000 lines of code to support and this probably isn't going
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to shrink any time soon (though the number has been surprisingly static
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since the beginning of 2010).  And if we include wifi there's the question
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of where one draws the feature line (do we accept patches and hence have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support lots of other front end code?).  I'm not sure if this would conflict
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with what Diva wants to do with wifi.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On balance, I would actually be in favor of including wifi in core.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think the benefits in terms of making OpenSim easier to pick up (hence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> growing the long-term ecosystem) would outweigh the extra support burden, as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> long as we were happy to limit the functionality that would go into it.
