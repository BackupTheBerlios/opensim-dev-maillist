<PRE>Ok have now had time to produce a proper test case for the problem I am
facing.

 

Environment:

 

OpenSim version: OpenSim head revision from today

OpenSim mode: Standalone

OS: Windows XP

Database: sqlite and mysql

 

Test sequence 1 using the latest SL viewer:

 

1)      Create a new user via console

2)      Login the user

Following messages appear in the log:

08:28:50 - [SCENE]: Received request for wearables of test test

08:28:53 - [LOCAL INVENTORY SERVICES CONNECTOR]: Could not find item with id
66c

41e39-38f9-f75a-024e-585989bfaba9

08:28:53 - [LOCAL INVENTORY SERVICES CONNECTOR]: Could not find item with id

41e39-38f9-f75a-0000-5859892f1111

08:29:04 - [GENERICMESSAGE]: Not handling GenericMessage with method-type
of: av

atarpicksrequest

3)      Added all body parts and shirt and pants

4)      Wear all of the above (side note: it seems like the eyes never show
up in viewer 2. Anyone else noticed this?)

5)      Changed the sex to male

6)      Logout (please see file inventory_after_avatar_creation.csv for
database state)

7)      Login the avatar

Avatar appears naked and the following appears in the log:

08:41:55 - [GENERICMESSAGE]: Not handling GenericMessage with method-type
of: av

atarpicksrequest

8)      Wear clothes again

9)      Logout (please see file inventory_after_relogin.csv for database
state)

10)   Quit OpenSim

11)   Start OpenSim

12)   Login the avatar

All inventory items appear ok but the avatar has reverted to female and the
following in the log:

08:48:40 - [GENERICMESSAGE]: Not handling GenericMessage with method-type
of: av

atarpicksrequest

 

Test sequence 2 using the latest SL viewer:

 

Exactly like sequence 1 but restarted the server after step 6. Exactly the
same results so this does not seem to be related to persisting the data at
server shutdown.

 

Test sequence 3 using older version 1 SL viewer:

 

When wearing any item things seem to work fine in the UI but I get the
following errors in the log:

 

10:48:18 - [APPEARANCE]: AvatarIsWearing

10:48:18 - [LOCAL INVENTORY SERVICES CONNECTOR]: Could not find item with id

41e39-38f9-f75a-024e-585989bfaba9

After steps 7 and 12 all appears ok and is worn.

 

Conclusion:

 

Maybe someone else is able to find something more from the information above
but what stands out for me is that with viewer 2 we always get the following
message in the logs:

 

08:41:55 - [GENERICMESSAGE]: Not handling GenericMessage with method-type
of: avatarpicksrequest

 

While with viewer 1 that line is not there.

 

Regards,

 

Olli
