<PRE>Hi,

As a content creator this concerns me.  I believe if I license my content to
an avatar, and then they go to another grid that any content pulled should
be from the grid that I have the content loaded into.  I think I should be
in control of my content.  I also think I should be able to block grids that
my content is being accessed from.  If you don't always maintain the
original content location there will be no control.  If I give someone a
copy of my content, then that is something else, they are now the owner of
it and are free to do as they please with it, at least within any license I
give them.  But that is a legal stuff not a technically programmed one.  At
least I don't expect all situations to be programmed.

Also when asset services start happening this will become more of an issue.
I will have XRMarketplace.com live soon and plan to start selling content
and provide that content as an asset server.  How will I maintain any kind
of control over the use of my content if people don't have to pull copies
from me?

I also think, and haven't seen in the new hypergrid, if someone goes to a
new grid I may not allow any of my content to go there unless that avatars
gets an authorization from me which should be attached to his proxy profile
for access into my grid/asset server.

The other thing to think about is how updates or corrections are propagated.
SL has a terrible system of only supporting copies so any updates or copies
have to be sent to everyone.  Seems content replacement needs to be
supported and if content is all over the place this will get even crazier.
Also to support dynamic content there needs to be a ways to refresh or
update content.  I suggest there needs to be an expiration date on the
content just like how images and HTML pages on the web work so that cached
content will know to pull a new copy.  And if the expiration date is 0, at
the time it was pulled, it will always get refreshed.

This is maybe should have its own discussion thread but seems to be part of
how this is all going to work.

M.

myticaldemina makes a lot of good points... one thing that could be 
problematic though relates to this comment...

&gt;<i>From: &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">mysticaldemina at xrgrid.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>...I would suggest any
</I>&gt;<i>proxies would give the external system and identifier and not chain proxy
</I>to
&gt;<i>proxy unless there is a reason to do it, and the assets should be copied
</I>&gt;<i>from the original source.
</I>

I agree with the first half... no chains, just hand over the external 
system &quot;authority&quot; and its given identifier pair for the identity involved.

But I don't agree at all with the idea that you then have to get the 
asset from that original authority.  The permissions could have 
changed, corruptions could have occurred or much more likely the 
authority simply will no longer be there.  The asset &quot;as is&quot; (with 
its textures, scripted content and what not) should be provided to 
the destination location/grid if the object permissions allow it, 
with proper transfer of the permissions to next owner exactly as if 
an avatar to avatar transfer or rez in world took place on the local 
grid, without trying to reload the asset from an original source.
