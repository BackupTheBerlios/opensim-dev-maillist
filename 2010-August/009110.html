<PRE>The more I think about this, the stronger I feel about Wifi not being  
included in core. It really doesn't belong there.

The goal here is ease of installation. That's the goal; the means to  
achieve it vary.

Not all addons are equal when it comes to installation overhead. Many  
(most) OpenSim addons out there (groups, offline IM, etc) require  
external components such as Apache, so there's a whole other side to  
them that has to do with running the Apache (or whatever) side of  
things. Even if you include the corresponding connectors as addons in  
the core distribution, this still doesn't make it easy for people to  
activate them. The fact that the service is not 100% integrated with  
OpenSim is what makes them more difficult to deal with.

Wifi doesn't require those external components, that's why it's such a  
no brainer.

Let's not jump to the conclusion that because Wifi is a 3rd party  
addon that it is as difficult to install as those other addons; that  
might not be the case. The difficulty of the others may have more to  
do with the Apache side of things, which obviously will never be  
included in OpenSim.

So, let's keep Wifi as an external addon, and see how things go.
