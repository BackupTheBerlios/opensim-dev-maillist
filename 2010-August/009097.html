<PRE>I have very mixed feelings about where to draw the line. It's tempting 
to add more things to core, but where do we stop? We can't just put 
everything in.

A better approach might be to somehow make it easy for people to get and 
install 3rd party packages. I'm going to try to make it easy for ppl to 
add Wifi to their installations. The issue here is dll version 
compatibility, so we'll see how far the ease can go.
