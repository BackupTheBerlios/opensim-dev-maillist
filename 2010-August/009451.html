<PRE>YES - this is a separate and VERY involved discussion!

As a content creator and retired IP lawyer I share mysticaldemina's concerns
.

However, lets not lose sight of the fact that the underlying legal issues
are far from settled!

Is a &quot;virtual good&quot; an &quot;object&quot; of some sort which is bought and sold, or is
it a &quot;work&quot; which must be licensed, or is it some other animal entirely?

There are courts which have found aspects of all three!

Concepts like &quot;fair use&quot; and &quot;scholarly use&quot; are nowhere near settled for
either software or virtual goods.

There have even been recent attempts to use &quot;copyright infringement&quot; as a
from of censorship!

In the US, the Library of Congress (who administer many aspects of US
copyright law) has issued a policy allowing legal &quot;DRM circumvention&quot; in
certain cases.

The real life fashion industry has totally abandoned the concept of
copyright and accepts &quot;knock offs&quot; as part of their business model. The
economics work out to be very similar to virtual fashions with very much
smaller numbers for both originals and copies.

Finally I note that many new bands are abandoning the &quot;sell copies of our
music&quot; business model and depending on their concert revenues to pay for
their art. Are they any good? Will this work? Who knows? I certainly don't

My point is that any DRM must exist within a framework of laws and must
reflect those laws or it is totally useless.

This issue is far more than &quot;lock the doors firmly to keep the bad guys
out&quot;!

It does need to be discussed (extensively!) but as Melanie points out this
belongs to HG V2.0 planning NOT HG V1.5!

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a content creator this concerns me.  I believe if I license my content
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> an avatar, and then they go to another grid that any content pulled should
</I>&gt;<i> be from the grid that I have the content loaded into.  I think I should be
</I>&gt;<i> in control of my content.  I also think I should be able to block grids
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> my content is being accessed from.  If you don't always maintain the
</I>&gt;<i> original content location there will be no control.  If I give someone a
</I>&gt;<i> copy of my content, then that is something else, they are now the owner of
</I>&gt;<i> it and are free to do as they please with it, at least within any license I
</I>&gt;<i> give them.  But that is a legal stuff not a technically programmed one.  At
</I>&gt;<i> least I don't expect all situations to be programmed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also when asset services start happening this will become more of an issue.
</I>&gt;<i> I will have XRMarketplace.com live soon and plan to start selling content
</I>&gt;<i> and provide that content as an asset server.  How will I maintain any kind
</I>&gt;<i> of control over the use of my content if people don't have to pull copies
</I>&gt;<i> from me?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also think, and haven't seen in the new hypergrid, if someone goes to a
</I>&gt;<i> new grid I may not allow any of my content to go there unless that avatars
</I>&gt;<i> gets an authorization from me which should be attached to his proxy profile
</I>&gt;<i> for access into my grid/asset server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing to think about is how updates or corrections are
</I>&gt;<i> propagated.
</I>&gt;<i> SL has a terrible system of only supporting copies so any updates or copies
</I>&gt;<i> have to be sent to everyone.  Seems content replacement needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> supported and if content is all over the place this will get even crazier.
</I>&gt;<i> Also to support dynamic content there needs to be a ways to refresh or
</I>&gt;<i> update content.  I suggest there needs to be an expiration date on the
</I>&gt;<i> content just like how images and HTML pages on the web work so that cached
</I>&gt;<i> content will know to pull a new copy.  And if the expiration date is 0, at
</I>&gt;<i> the time it was pulled, it will always get refreshed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is maybe should have its own discussion thread but seems to be part of
</I>&gt;<i> how this is all going to work.

</I>&gt;<i> myticaldemina makes a lot of good points... one thing that could be
</I>&gt;<i> problematic though relates to this comment...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From: &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">mysticaldemina at xrgrid.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;...I would suggest any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;proxies would give the external system and identifier and not chain proxy
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;proxy unless there is a reason to do it, and the assets should be copied
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;from the original source.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with the first half... no chains, just hand over the external
</I>&gt;<i> system &quot;authority&quot; and its given identifier pair for the identity involved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I don't agree at all with the idea that you then have to get the
</I>&gt;<i> asset from that original authority.  The permissions could have
</I>&gt;<i> changed, corruptions could have occurred or much more likely the
</I>&gt;<i> authority simply will no longer be there.  The asset &quot;as is&quot; (with
</I>&gt;<i> its textures, scripted content and what not) should be provided to
</I>&gt;<i> the destination location/grid if the object permissions allow it,
</I>&gt;<i> with proper transfer of the permissions to next owner exactly as if
</I>&gt;<i> an avatar to avatar transfer or rez in world took place on the local
</I>&gt;<i> grid, without trying to reload the asset from an original source.
</I>&gt;<i> .
