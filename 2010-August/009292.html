<PRE>In our load testing, we use TestClient from OpenMetaverse which is implemented using GridClient. We have contributed several changes in the past few weeks related to running a hundred or more bots in a single TestClient instance. The main reason we see incomplete appearance is that TestClient does not have time to bake each appearance before the appearance handshake times out between TestClient and the server. All client threads become consumed baking/encoding/decoding image data. They all slow down and new baking requests appear to time out.

There are 2 workarounds for this we have used with equal success:

1. Run fewer than 25 clients per TestClient instance.
2. Increase the baking timeouts in TestClient (passed as params to GridClient's AppearanceManager) to a large value (10+ minutes). 

We routinely run 300-400 bots against a single region using 4 TestClient instances with 100 bots each.
We also run 1000+ bots on our research grid using 40 TestClient instances with 25 bots each or 10 instances of 100 each.
In both of these situations, every avatar appears baked in the viewer.

&gt;<i> Hello Everybody,

</I>&gt;<i> My observation is this one :
</I>&gt;<i> When we log a lot of bots (50 for instance), the appearance of the bots is not completely loaded for each bot. Some of them are fully loaded, while some others have just hair, eye, or just a grey part of skull loaded (or a ghost with SL viewer).

</I>&gt;<i> This problem is occuring on 0.7.0, and didn't existed on 0.6.8

</I>&gt;<i> Maybe these problem are bound to each others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wrote this to understand, if somebody could tell me what information is stored about each avatars, and where is it stored (for instance the last position of the avatar).

Last and home positions are stored in a table called GridUser.  Appearance information effectively comes from the body 
part and clothing entries in an avatar's inventory and the assets that they link to.  This is stored in inventoryitems 
(and the assets table, of course).

I've seen problems with appearance with multiple bots on Intel load tests as well.  Don't know why this is.
