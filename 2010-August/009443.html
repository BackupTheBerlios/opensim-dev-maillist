<PRE>Right. I think some of the use cases related to how content is shared
have been glossed over. In a completely open model which is what has
been discussed this is all pretty straightforward.  But if I'm running
an asset service (as part of a grid or separately) I might want to
provide access controls as part of that service. The same with user
services.  I may have a trust relationship with one agent service and
allow content to be transferred to agents that service represents. But
for another agent service for which no such relationship exists I'd like
to deny access to content. And even in the transfer case does the new
user get a new copy or a reference. That concept isn't supported now but
in a distributed grid its an important distinction. I might wish to know
that copies of objects rezzed in a simulator always come from a specific
asset service.

In short I think how the security model works is way more important than
a caching optimization being applied to a URI/URL.  Its important to
understand what levels of trust between services are supported and under
what conditions an access is supported.  As an Agent Service I may
consider even the &quot;Names&quot; of my users to be confidential and only to be
revealed to services for which a trust relationship exists.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a content creator this concerns me.  I believe if I license my content to
</I>&gt;<i> an avatar, and then they go to another grid that any content pulled should
</I>&gt;<i> be from the grid that I have the content loaded into.  I think I should be
</I>&gt;<i> in control of my content.  I also think I should be able to block grids that
</I>&gt;<i> my content is being accessed from.  If you don't always maintain the
</I>&gt;<i> original content location there will be no control.  If I give someone a
</I>&gt;<i> copy of my content, then that is something else, they are now the owner of
</I>&gt;<i> it and are free to do as they please with it, at least within any license I
</I>&gt;<i> give them.  But that is a legal stuff not a technically programmed one.  At
</I>&gt;<i> least I don't expect all situations to be programmed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also when asset services start happening this will become more of an issue.
</I>&gt;<i> I will have XRMarketplace.com live soon and plan to start selling content
</I>&gt;<i> and provide that content as an asset server.  How will I maintain any kind
</I>&gt;<i> of control over the use of my content if people don't have to pull copies
</I>&gt;<i> from me?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also think, and haven't seen in the new hypergrid, if someone goes to a
</I>&gt;<i> new grid I may not allow any of my content to go there unless that avatars
</I>&gt;<i> gets an authorization from me which should be attached to his proxy profile
</I>&gt;<i> for access into my grid/asset server.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing to think about is how updates or corrections are propagated.
</I>&gt;<i> SL has a terrible system of only supporting copies so any updates or copies
</I>&gt;<i> have to be sent to everyone.  Seems content replacement needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> supported and if content is all over the place this will get even crazier.
</I>&gt;<i> Also to support dynamic content there needs to be a ways to refresh or
</I>&gt;<i> update content.  I suggest there needs to be an expiration date on the
</I>&gt;<i> content just like how images and HTML pages on the web work so that cached
</I>&gt;<i> content will know to pull a new copy.  And if the expiration date is 0, at
</I>&gt;<i> the time it was pulled, it will always get refreshed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is maybe should have its own discussion thread but seems to be part of
</I>&gt;<i> how this is all going to work.

</I>&gt;<i> myticaldemina makes a lot of good points... one thing that could be 
</I>&gt;<i> problematic though relates to this comment...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From: &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">mysticaldemina at xrgrid.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;...I would suggest any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;proxies would give the external system and identifier and not chain proxy
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;proxy unless there is a reason to do it, and the assets should be copied
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;from the original source.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with the first half... no chains, just hand over the external 
</I>&gt;<i> system &quot;authority&quot; and its given identifier pair for the identity involved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I don't agree at all with the idea that you then have to get the 
</I>&gt;<i> asset from that original authority.  The permissions could have 
</I>&gt;<i> changed, corruptions could have occurred or much more likely the 
</I>&gt;<i> authority simply will no longer be there.  The asset &quot;as is&quot; (with 
</I>&gt;<i> its textures, scripted content and what not) should be provided to 
</I>&gt;<i> the destination location/grid if the object permissions allow it, 
</I>&gt;<i> with proper transfer of the permissions to next owner exactly as if 
</I>&gt;<i> an avatar to avatar transfer or rez in world took place on the local 
</I>&gt;<i> grid, without trying to reload the asset from an original source.
</I>&gt;<i> .
