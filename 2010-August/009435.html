<PRE>It was buried in another post, but I maintain that the definitive problem is
not th eone where the &quot;authority&quot; simply disappears (wait to update the
cache), but where there are multiple &quot;authorities&quot; claiming the same UUID!

There are numerous reasons why this could happen, ONE of which is
&quot;malfeasance&quot; (fraud)!

More likely is the case where the cached &quot;authority&quot; is very much out of
date and there have been several changes since the last cache update! In
some situations this could happen in only a few minutes!

Every other case resolves to (a) it is in the cache (update whenever we can)
or (b) the (single) authority can tell us what we should use as the
&quot;name&quot;/UUID

While Diva has pointed out that EVERY &quot;name&quot; is really a UUID (not obvious
in the &quot;global&quot; case) many of the comments imply that the &quot;name&quot; is some
arbitrary text string!

I claim that Diva is exactly correct - the UUID *IS* the name BOTH global
and local, and the &quot;text string&quot; (of whatever form) is merely the &quot;human
compatible liveware&quot; version.  ANYTHING else leads to an enormous number of
identity collisions!

I think that it is all available in the &quot;open&quot; literature now, but in the
1960's/1970's the US Military spent an enormous effort ($$$) to be certain
that the person with the badge &quot;General Jack D. Ripper&quot; really WAS that
person! With Nuclear Weapons the stakes really ARE that high!

Our problem is very similar although not with such dramatic consequences.
