</I>IMHO, all references should always be to a key type that is by
definition not prone to collision.  UUIDs were designed for this
purpose.  That does leave what user name and whatever a UUID maps to. 
Caching the mapping with something like memcache should be possible.  
Stuffing possibly mutable [and/or collision prone] data  into URIs
(effectively pointers) or other identifiers is a bad idea.  Identifiers
are not supposed to be meaning or semantic bearing.
