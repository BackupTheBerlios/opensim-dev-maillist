<PRE>Hello Everybody,

I made some additionnal test using bots (GridClient)(using different viewer, different database on Opensim 0.7.0).


My observation is this one :
When we log a lot of bots (50 for instance), the appearance of the bots is not completely loaded for each bot. Some of them are fully loaded, while some others have just hair, eye, or just a grey part of skull loaded (or a ghost with SL viewer).

This problem is occuring on 0.7.0, and didn't existed on 0.6.8
Actually, I already talked about that, but, the new fact is that when a bon log into the simulation, it is set to the HOME location, and not to its previous position into the simulation.
Maybe these problem are bound to each others.

I wrote this to understand, if somebody could tell me what information is stored about each avatars, and where is it stored (for instance the last position of the avatar).
For instance, where is stored the appearance of the avatar, and when it is loaded.


Thanks a lot for your cooperation, I greatly appreciate it,
'Arigatou gozaimasu' from Japan
