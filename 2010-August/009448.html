<PRE>M... I believe we are talking about the current situation where you 
give or sell copies of assets to others and they might have open/full 
or restricted permissions on them. They can then be used as 
appropriate without reauthentication or update of those assets being 
required.. as the provider might be long gone, site down, or the 
internet connection may not be possible. Anyone with the permissions 
you have given can do what you have allowed surely.

I think we should view the Hypergrid as one big grid for this 
purpose.  The licence and any object/asset permissions that back up 
that licence you give to another  avatar should work across the 
environment they can reach, and the systems should respect those 
permissions when handling the assets.

You are raising quite valid points about a broader dynamically 
provided asset set from possibly many locations that can be licenced, 
used and updated in interesting and useful ways.  Maybe that's worth 
discussion on a separate thread of discussion.

&gt;<i>As a content creator this concerns me.  I believe if I license my content to
</I>&gt;<i>an avatar, and then they go to another grid that any content pulled should
</I>&gt;<i>be from the grid that I have the content loaded into.  I think I should be
</I>&gt;<i>in control of my content.  I also think I should be able to block grids that
</I>&gt;<i>my content is being accessed from.  If you don't always maintain the
</I>&gt;<i>original content location there will be no control.  If I give someone a
</I>&gt;<i>copy of my content, then that is something else, they are now the owner of
</I>&gt;<i>it and are free to do as they please with it, at least within any license I
</I>&gt;<i>give them.  But that is a legal stuff not a technically programmed one.  At
</I>&gt;<i>least I don't expect all situations to be programmed.
</I>&gt;<i>...
</I>&gt;<i>This is maybe should have its own discussion thread but seems to be part of
</I>&gt;<i>how this is all going to work.
