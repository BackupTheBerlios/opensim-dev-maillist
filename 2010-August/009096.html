I must admit, one part of me would be very happy to see it in core since it does provide the basics for managing small 
OpenSim installations (default avatars, account creation, password recovery, etc.).

On the other hand, I'm always concerned about expansion of core - we already have 500,000 lines of code to support and 
this probably isn't going to shrink any time soon (though the number has been surprisingly static since the beginning of 
2010).  And if we include wifi there's the question of where one draws the feature line (do we accept patches and hence 
have to support lots of other front end code?).  I'm not sure if this would conflict with what Diva wants to do with wifi.

On balance, I would actually be in favor of including wifi in core.  I think the benefits in terms of making OpenSim 
easier to pick up (hence growing the long-term ecosystem) would outweigh the extra support burden, as long as we were 
happy to limit the functionality that would go into it.
