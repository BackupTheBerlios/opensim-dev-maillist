</I>&gt;<i> That's what's going on.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is probably also a hidden question of how to mark a local
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> account as linked to a foreign identity, which may solve the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> friending issue. If I am friends with your avatar and we are both on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grid B but your avatar actually originated from grid A, that link in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the profile is what can tip off the presence service to try a remote
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> presence check (assuming the user is not online in the local grid).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My only interest in these low level questions like how the global
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> identifiers and profile links look is what the final decision is so I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can implement it in the OpenSim SimianGrid connectors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, we distinguish &quot;user accounts&quot; from &quot;grid users&quot; -- these are 2
</I>&gt;<i> different interfaces, although implementers may decide to collapse
</I>&gt;<i> them. But they are different concepts. User accounts are the
</I>&gt;<i> locally-registered users; in some cases, like for example, the UCI
</I>&gt;<i> grid, there's only some people who can get accounts there, namely
</I>&gt;<i> people associated with the university. Grid users are users that are
</I>&gt;<i> referenced by things that happen in the grid. So we already have an
</I>&gt;<i> interface for that, although now I'm thinking that perhaps we need to
</I>&gt;<i> separate its UserID field into 2 things: a local UUID and a reference
</I>&gt;<i> to the external name. And I guess that's my main issue at this point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It seems more reasonable in a distributed system to say that an X is an
X - a User is a User, whether they originally were instantiated on a
local or a remote system.   So I would go for collapsing the two as much
as possible as a matter of policy.  Otherwise freedom to move between
nodes in the system is more limited and there is more special case logic
to deal with.    But that is speaking from a general distributed
computing perspective.  There may be many Opensim details that make that
seemingly ideal position in practice rather naive.
