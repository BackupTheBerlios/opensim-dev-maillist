<PRE>It seems to me that if the &quot;global&quot; name is considered to actually be
URI/user/UUID/[+stuff] as diva is suggesting, then any ambiguity is
resolvable by the original system.

If that URI becomes invalid then there are already mechanisms to resolve
successor URIs as needed.

If there is some conflict (i.e. a long stored backup) then the assumption
must be that wherever the UUID is found must be the &quot;successor&quot;.

This is not foolproof if someone is truly malicious, but any naming system
can be spoofed without some other form of authentication.

The obvious &quot;worst case&quot; here is to have several systems which appear to be
the &quot;sucessor&quot; to the original.

This is why I suggested using a type 1 UUID which is derived from the
originator's MAC address and a time stamp. It was originally abandoned
because identified the originator so very well (see THAT extended
discussion! LOL), but in this case we actually want an unambiguous
identification.

In the worst case I described then you would have to hunt for other UUIDs
available to you which have the same MAC address and similar time stamps for
clues as to which is the &quot;genuine&quot; system. It then becomes a probability
game in which the genuine successor has likely originated many more
name/UUID pairs than a forger.

I agree fully that the central authority does not solve this problem, it
merely makes another target for the &quot;bad guy&quot; to corrupt, take over or
spoof. Peer to peer technology (e.g. Bottorrent and Emule/KAD) has developed
a very robust authentication system with no central server required for
example.
