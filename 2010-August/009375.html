<PRE>mmm... the argument that tacking an identifier onto the end of a URL
smacks of premature optimization to me. it should be possible for any
reasonable client to cache the relationship between a display name and
a URL. in fact, HTTP has some mechanisms to help you with that. so you
wouldn't have to query the agent service EVERY time you need the name.

at linden i developed a pathological dislike of the <A HREF="secondlife:///">secondlife:///</A> URI
scheme (more on that later), and making the path of URLs &quot;important&quot;
sort of smacks of that old URI scheme. i understand why you might want
to stuff names and other information into URLs, but IMHO, the benefits
you get from one less query is minimal compared to loss of
flexibility.

for instance... the reason the VWRAP CALM message exists is because
jhurliman and i sorta figured out it would be a PITA to support
multiple revisions of the <A HREF="secondlife:///">secondlife:///</A> URI handling code. john was
doing some cool stuff with OAuth and OpenID to allow peeps to log into
a grid via the web. the last part of john's auth process was to
redirect you to a <A HREF="secondlife:///">secondlife:///</A> URI.

the idea here was that if the second life viewer was installed, then
it would register itself as a helper app for that URI scheme and &quot;do
the right thing&quot; of rezzing you at a certain location on the main
grid.

but

the problem here was that the <A HREF="secondlife:///">secondlife:///</A> URI handling code in the
viewer would ONLY rez you on linden's main grid. we would have had to
modify the viewer to handle the addition of a 'loginurl' term. it was
technically doable, but i was worried about maintaining the URI scheme
as the defacto way of altering the viewer's startup behavior. i was
kinda worried that anyone who wanted to experiment with new features
for the SL viewer would have to perform surgery on the <A HREF="secondlife:///">secondlife:///</A>
URI handling code (and might become durty with respect to the GPL in
the process.)

so john and i put our heads together and came up with the CALM idea.
from a technical perspective it seemed a bit easier to take everything
that was buried in the <A HREF="secondlife:///">secondlife:///</A> URI and turn it into a LLSD map.
since we already had LLSD map parsing code, it was pretty
straightforward to use. it also allowed us to remove the processing of
startup messages from the GPL'd source, which had been problematic for
some people.

so why am i hijacking this thread to tell you about the history of a
VWRAP component? mostly as a parable about making things as flexible
as possible. had the <A HREF="secondlife:///">secondlife:///</A> URI scheme (and it's
implementation in the viewer) not been inflexible, we would never have
had to take the time to build the CALM scheme.

starting with designs that enhance flexibility will payoff in the future.

though seriously, it's not going to be the end of the world if you do
this &quot;wrong.&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sigh
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The name has absolutely zero value for any sort of attribution. &#160;I can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have the same name someplace else (or on the same grid if the grid owner
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allows it an uses some other identifier or mechanism for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authentication). Only UUID is valid to identify a specific agent. &#160;Also,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what if I don't want just anyone to know the full names of my users. &#160;Or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if I use a slightly different mechanism to describe a user (email
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addresses for instance).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The core developers have said over and over again that OpenSim is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> framework. &#160;That being the case the semantics of &quot;names&quot; can vary across
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grids and how could you ever depend on anything like that to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;attribution&quot;. &#160;Only the Agent service for a grid should be able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolve agent id's down to more specific information. &#160;In that way it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can also provide whatever access controls on that information the grid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> owner prefers in order to enforce that grid's TOS.
