<PRE>My understanding was that *-post-fixes branches would get all the fixes from master that have been committed since the last release; only new features added since the last release remain solely in master.

But with the 0.7.0.1 release, which was taken from 0.7-post-fixes, there are several fixes that are only in master. Examples:

54dcfe3 Fixes: llSetLinkPrimitiveParams - PRIM_POSITION is not relative to root, causes unexpected movement of child prims
f809797 Allow the trash folder itself to be passed to PurgeFolder
1869572 Prevent setting the hovertext from firing changed_color

Were these and other fixes intentionally left out of 0.7-post-fixes? What are the actual criteria for adding a commit also to a *-post-fixes branch?
