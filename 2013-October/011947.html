<PRE>Hello, I'm highly interested in region border crossing support for vehicles
(actually vehicle types airplane, balloon and boat). As such I already
explored Opensim 12 - 18 months ago. There was a lot of rumor about
BulletSim and upcoming work that will be done in the direction of my
interests, so I decided to wait.

Now, one year later, I'm happy to see big improvements with BulletSim but I
still cant see any improvements in region border crossing. I read a side
note in the dev meeting minutes of 2013/08/20 where Nebadon mentioned that
Melanie is itching to get vehicle border crossing in before someone else
attempts it. However, I cant find any further information nor anything else
related in the Mantis.

What are the current plans, are there any? Am I missing something or is the
hype over? And what can I actively do to get the work done that's needed to
get it as fast as possible? From my side I can offer some time for testing
on both, Windows and/or Debian Linux. I'm not a crack, but in addition to
LSL I also have an average knowledge of C#/.Net and can at least read and
understand the code or even make small changes. I'm somewhat familiar with
OpenMetaverse and have a deep knowledge of Radegast and its plugin concept.

Now it's your turn to get on me with your suggestions and information how
to proceed.
