&gt;<i> Hello, I'm highly interested in region border crossing support for

</I>Melanie's work was, I believe, held back from Core OpenSim, while work 
needed for OSCC and the 0.7.6 release was being done. She said, on Oct. 
6th, in IRC, that she'd been given a &quot;green light&quot; to start adding it. 
She commented that she needed to make time in her schedule, for the 
merging, which would probably start soon, and that the first things that 
would be merged were the entity transfer module and scene presence 
changes, as they are the base for the region crossing code.

So, be patient just a little longer, as it looks like the long wait is 
about to be over. :)
