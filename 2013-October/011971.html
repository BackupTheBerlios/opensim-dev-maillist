<PRE>This is an issue if all caching is disabled.  However, it should have been fine with just disk caching enabled.  This is 
the default that OpenSimulator ships with - one shouldn't need to do any copying of FlotsamCache.ini.example, though it 
won't hurt.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a very interested observer of this issue, but not a Singu team member just a user, I would like to make a hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> helpful comment and also confirm this issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed this issue about 2 weeks ago and have been testing extensively since then as I too suffered it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have mostly solved the byproduct; the error message in the log (not the root cause) by enabling the server cache (copy
</I>&gt;<i> the FlotsamCache.ini.example to FlotsamCache.ini - OS setup documents mostly forget to constantly tell people this
</I>&gt;<i> rather important step &gt;.&gt;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a side effect loads are also much faster.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Googlefu found and confirmed that enabling *both* memory and disk caching in the FlotsamCache.ini file must be done to
</I>&gt;<i> remove the error. (Devs: Remind me to add the cross reference to OpenSim's mantis later. hehe.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With 2 weeks solid testing, it seems at least on my OS regions if you don't have both settings set to on then the baked
</I>&gt;<i> textures are obtained by the server on TP in, but not applied and then lost by the OpenSim server as it deals with
</I>&gt;<i> everything else before finally rendering you. Before this workaround, on my regions at least, when it came time to
</I>&gt;<i> render the avatar I saw the warning in the logs. The previously sent but lost (due to insufficient server caching) baked
</I>&gt;<i> textures are thus re-requested and applied and you finally turn from cloud to avatar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (As a hint to the reporter, I also bumped up my cache retention quite a lot as my three regions are not so high traffic.
</I>&gt;<i> I can afford the ram and disk to hold things for 3 days to a week even. YMMV depending on scenes and visitors.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All that said:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is STILL the root cause to this issue as I see it, in that the baked textures for a new person to the region - to
</I>&gt;<i> my inexpert eyes looking at both server and client logs in depth - are done at the wrong interest level or lost by the
</I>&gt;<i> server. As a hint to any developer who looks at this in the future; it's almost looks like the avatar needs to be baked,
</I>&gt;<i> rendered and placed in world before the world is drawn around it... as an alternative, there could be a new step
</I>&gt;<i> included in the initial region processes... draw a known default texture as skin/eyes until the baked texture is ready.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect Cool does this by displaying a blank white skin, but I've not yet bothered digging into Henri's code to see
</I>&gt;<i> his differences. Avatars on Cool do rez super fast, but they come in as blank textured, 0xFFFFFF coloured and remain
</I>&gt;<i> that way it seems for as long as Singu people are clouds. It's better to look at.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ((Votes +1 for return of your shape but 0xFFFFFF skinned Ruths))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No matter what viewer though... My own server logs after this flotsam change is made show new people to the region will
</I>&gt;<i> be unbaked for a while. Far less than without a server cache though. Some people will need to force rebake. But the
</I>&gt;<i> error is gone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a respectful triage hint... I'd love to be proven wrong but this seems like it's an OpenSim root cause, but I do feel
</I>&gt;<i> Singu could handle that failure better. I should discuss it one day in depth with a dev when new people into my region
</I>&gt;<i> stay as a cloud.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reporter: If you have fcache turned on with both memory and hard disk and are seeing those errors then my findings are
</I>&gt;<i> for a different bug. But as the error messages were the same 2 weeks ago and I've not had one since... it is worth
</I>&gt;<i> writing this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /me leaves it for the very capable Singu team to research/triage further. ;)
