<PRE>I agree here with Stefan. Although I am fairly new to the community I have
met with Sakai/Steve and he was very nice to me. I also have met with
RealXtend who are very gracious. I think we have many teams developing
proprietary mixes but isn&#8217;t that what the BSD license is about? I foresee a
day when many companies have customized OpenSim installations and for many
reasons, security, profit, company intellectual property issues, custom
integration and more have chosen not to contribute back some or all of their
own code. 
 
This is partly why OpenSim is appealing. It could be argued that OLG with
its easy installer and other freebies is growing the community and proving a
business model which is benefitting the growth of OpenSim. I think it would
be nice if OLG/RealXtend shared as much as possible of their new code but
again the BSD license allows for them not doing this.  I think we should
embrace all grids using OpenSim as the core regardless of what they gave
back or if they forked.   Perhaps it is being left off the list that is
making these grids and developers feel like they are not part of the
community. At the very least give them some clarity. Even here

gives credit to OpenSim.

People,
 
I guess we need to clarify this policy on the grid page, as that only states
&quot;Grid List Policy: Please only list your grid is your software is based on
OpenSimulator.org SVN software code&quot; which obviously is too vague.
 
How many of the grids on that page would you say are &quot;contributing back&quot;?
and what is &quot;some time&quot;?
 
could you define &quot;pure opensimulator grid&quot;? How far from trunk shall we
deviate before we're not &quot;pure&quot;?
 
Tribal Media has Tribal Server, our own branded version of OpenSim, just
like 3Di has its. Ours are retail products that are not completely open
source. But it sure is OpenSim.
 
I have no idea what's going on with OLG, so could you please guide me to the
post where they state that &quot;they have officially forked and are no longer
using, or supporting, OpenSim&quot;.

Best regards,
Stefan Andersson

Well there is a bit more history to this than just then forking it, but they
have not contributed back to this project, and really has realxtend for that
matter, at this point only pure opensimulator grids will be listed unless
the project is directly contributing back to the project, which openlife
grid has not done in some time and like melanie has said they have forked
into a new project and have even renamed it something else and its also a
retail product thats not completely open source.

That is weird they (OpenLife) are using RealXtend which is OpenSim at the
core and I see Steve/Sakai talking in this thread and contributing. Seems
like OpenLife is as much a part of the community as the rest. Am I missing
something or don't they deserve to be a listed grid as well?

Hi,

the reason was that they have officially forked and are no longer
using, or supporting, OpenSim.
