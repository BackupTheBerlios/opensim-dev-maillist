<PRE>Hi,

I've been noticing that there is a certain confusion in the code about 
the names of methods and fields when it comes to denoting a user vs. an 
agent vs. an avatar. That could be cleaned up, eventually, if someone is 
up for a little bit of renaming. But there seems to be a deeper 
confusion in the data structures themselves, and that's much nastier to 
deal with. Specifically, agents take the UUIDs of the users they 
represent, instead of having a UUID of their own and pointing to the 
user. By doing this, the separation between user and agent is defeated. 
Also, AgentCircuitData takes a copy of the first and last names of the 
users they represent, and this is a bit fragile when one wants to 
process the names of users in interesting ways.

I really like the conceptual separation of those 3 things. I can imagine 
situations where it is advantageous for a single user to be logged in 
several times -- e.g. wanting to attend multiple events at the same time.

Is this &quot;id collapse&quot; being done for optimization? Or is this one of 
those things that made it to the code and never got challenged? Or is 
this a well-known TODO?

This is not urgent, I'm just wondering what the story is.

Crista
