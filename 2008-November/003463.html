<PRE>Yes, I think catching duplicates is important - but I'm not 100% confident the Mantis SOAP adapter is sufficiently advanced that we can search for that, but I think that might warrant us building a separate webapp for this actually if we can't.

In terms of catching the errors - that part is relatively easy, we're a managed application which means we can catch exceptions at the root level. Getting those is easier - it's already been suggested we use a secondary application so we can catch Mono errors too, but I'm not quite sure we really want to do that - because I believe that falls outside the OpenSim scope. (ie issues with Mono are a problem for Mono)

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Automated Bug Reporting

Brilliant idea back there! An automated bug reporting system would certainly be one helpful thing. But indeed it would raise a lot of complications and could even risk sending false positives at one point. And indeed the best method for this is a separate project in the Mantis. opensim-automated_bug_report or something else. Otherwise I don't think it would be a good idea.. a separate project is the best method in Mantis that would keep things arranged at their best with this.

Now a question; How would we prevent this from making a flood of an unrecognizable pile of issues and crashes? What if the user keeps experiencing the same crash over and over again? That crash will be spammed 100 times in that Mantis project which wouldn't be that good. So I'm suggesting a way in which every single type of crash is auto-reported only once. If the parameters of a crash being reported are exactly the same as an older crash already there, skip that second report so the same thing doesn't get posted two times.

And now another problem; -Who- will report a crash if the only running process (opensim.exe) is the one who crashes and disappears? We could either make it so opensim.exe sends the previous crash to Mantis the next time it starts, or some background process watches opensim.exe and the second it crashes it takes all the info and throws into the Mantis.

Subject: [Opensim-dev] Automated Bug Reporting
The subject has been raised recently, in anticipation of the 0.6.0 release about including an automated bug report process in OpenSim, obviously it would be switched off by default, but the option would exist to have exceptions logged in OpenSim reported to the Mantis bug tracker automatically.

The big advantage to doing so is it becomes easier to prioritise which bugs need to be fixed - issues which occur frequently would immediately become visible (whereas right now they aren't so much). It would also allow us to get some debug feedback on features we implement - ie internal exceptions which we ignore right now could be dumped onto the mantis with appropriate tags.

The solution I am considering for implementing this is the MantisConnect .NET adapter which basically uses the mantis SOAP interface - right now we've got a section of code in the main OpenSim.exe which handles the 'last exception' - I'd like to put the code initially in there, then open the option up for developers to report bugs via a 'Util' member function at a later point.

In terms of Mantis itself, I'm thinking it might be best to setup a second project for the automated reports - while we lose the ability to then link issues as 'related' with a manual report, it also avoids cluttering up the project with thousands of automated reports.

Thoughts?

Adam
