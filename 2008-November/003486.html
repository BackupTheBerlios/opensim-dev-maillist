Todd,
 
from the tone in your letter, it sounds like you are an official representative of openlifegrid. Are you?
 
If so, could you tell us if you are still using opensim for openlife grid regions and if you are doing periodic updates of your opensim code base from the opensim repository. I believe that is what people are wondering/questioning.
 
Also, do you state that you are opensim-based anywhere on your site, and if so, could you provide an url to that page?
 
I'm not making any demands, just noting that if you could answer these questions, the matter would probably be solved without further flame drama.

It sounds like ranting to me.   Of course OpenLifeGrid has contributed...And at least our system runs on real servers...&quot;Like i said come to osgrid.org i will give you a server and you can prove it too me, i have never ever seen anyone get 45k prims into a simulator ever under any circumstance, you are both wrong and i will prove it to you and anyone who wishes to see it proven.. DONT TALK SHOW ME!! all you talkers need to shut up and do some work to prove your claims.&quot;<A HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ta2025/3007243590/Do">http://www.flickr.com/photos/ta2025/3007243590/Do</A> you want more? or is 45,400 enough?  That took 17 minutes and no problems with 5-10 people watching over my shoulder..Anyone can come to Bourbon Street @ OpenLifeGrid to see for themselves.  <A HREF="http://openlifegrid.com">http://openlifegrid.com</A> No need for silly drama any more.  We guarantee 45,000 prims - we deliver!
