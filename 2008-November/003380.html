Just FYI. Sorry for the formatting, Google Groups sucks.

Has there any work being done on accelerating some ODE features (say,
collision detection) using ATI/nVidia GPUs? I wasn't able to find
anything so far.

Those familiar with both AMD Stream and CUDA, which architecture
provides a better match for ODE?

With 1 GByte on-card memory, how much scene complexity (e.g. in
OpenSim) can I expect to handle without resorting swapping to main
memory?

Thanks.

I'm working on a dWorldStep implementation in CUDA, but it's not
complete, nor optimized. Hopefully I'll have some time to finish it in
two or three moths (hopefully with some other operations, like
narrow-phase collision detection too).

I think NVIDIA is doing a better job promoting CUDA than AMD
promoting... whatever it's the current name.

Feature-wise they are incredibly similar. I don't have much experience
with FireStream, but apparently it doesn't expose different types of
memory like CUDA does, so you have to trust the platform (which IMHO you
shouldn't for any new technology) to do the correct optimizations.

Apparently the Bullet guys are working on CUDA too, might be worth checking
out:  <A HREF="http://www.bulletphysics.com/Bullet/wordpress/">http://www.bulletphysics.com/Bullet/wordpress/</A>

We are indeed working on a broadphase, narrowphase and constraint solver in
CUDA for Bullet. This parallel constraint solver is similar to quickstep.
Some results will be discussed at the Game Developers Conference in 2009.

CUDA is probably the best way to go for now. It will likely be easy to port
from CUDA to OpenCL in the future (both NVidia and AMD will support OpenCL).
Hope this helps,
Erwin
