<PRE>As the bard says, a rose by any other name...

But I'm not sure that changing the name will significantly reduce the 
confusion about what it does. Looking at the class tells us what it does, 
what is missing is the additional stuff that says what it should do, what 
it could do, and why it has been separated; all presumably evident in the 
plan. I know that the idea of spending a significant amount of time 
documenting or specifying this stuff has little appeal, but if we want 
OpenSim to grow, it really becomes a necessity. We can get away with it as 
long as the people who &quot;know&quot; what these things do are part of the 
project, and the project is small enough for those people to be able to 
chat to anyone who has a question. But neither of those hold in the long 
term. I'm not talking so much about an accurate documentation of what is 
in the classes, that is arguably redundant, I'm talking about capturing 
the rationale and the considerations that influenced the present structure 
and design.

And I'll be very happy if someone says &quot;it's over there you idiot&quot;.

So I say +1 to the rename, as long as pithy statement of how the set of 
classes Scene-InnerScene-RegonInfo et al comes along with it :-)

Noblesse oblige.

Best regards
Alan

[Opensim-dev]  Renaming innerscene






A long time ago, we started the process of separating the 3d scene 
handling code into its own class, rather than having it mixed in with more 
region level code, like rezzing/inventory handling. 

It was always planned to renamed the InnerScene and Scene classes, once 
this separation of the 3d scene graph code was completed. The original 
plan being that Scene became Region (or something like that) and 
InnerScene changed to Scene. 

It might be a bit to much work to rename the Scene class at this stage. 
But what are everyone thoughts on renaming InnerScene to something like 
SceneGraph. 

I think the InnerScene class is one of the more confusing areas as a lot 
new coders aren't really aware what design role it is meant to play.
