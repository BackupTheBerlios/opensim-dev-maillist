<PRE>Hi,

Just a quick note to tell you that the hypergrid extension is rapidly 
progressing. The two most important functions, teleports and inventory 
access, are essentially done, modulo a list of things that are still 
TODO. Noteworthy:

- if you have a scripted object in your inventory, and you rez it in a 
foreign place, that works already.
- if you're in a foreign place and you &quot;take&quot; an object to your 
inventory, it gets stored in your home inventory/asset servers. You can 
rez it back home.

Things that still don't work, or aren't properly tested:
- updating inventory items while in foreign places
- giving inventory to foreign avatars
- objects with complex inventories

In the next few days, besides completing the missing functionality, I 
will be writing documentation about the hypergrid, including possible 
uses, what the security problems are and some ideas for tackling them, 
and details on how the hypergrid extension is implemented over the core 
opensim.

Once I have the documentation in place, I will disseminate more broadly 
how to run opensim in hypergrid mode, as well as the addresses of a few 
hypergrid-ready nodes out there that you can link to.

In the meantime, if you want to test this out, you can do it over the 
hyperlink that exists between the region &quot;UCI Welcome&quot; @ OSGrid and the 
UCI Grid. Go to that region in OSGrid, pull up the map, search for 
ucigrid, TP there, and rez some object out of your OSGrid inventory; you 
can also &quot;Take Copy&quot; of objects that are there and rez them once you're 
back. To get back to OSGrid, simply hit the Home key combo Ctrl-Shift-H 
(that works already, assuming you have a &quot;home&quot; that's up &amp; running).

The funny thing about the hypergrid is that the more functionally 
complete it gets, the more it looks like normality :-) Except that 
centralized control (of assets, users, rules, space, etc.) is replaced 
with decentralized, but interoperable, control.
