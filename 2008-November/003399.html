<PRE>I am mostly interested in the email field for maintenance. Lost password,
Grid updates etc.  So a user could use any email for this and keep their own
private. Since this is a field on our registration form I will make a note
that this email is mainly for maintenance but to feel free to use any email
address as we do not share.  Good point!

In reality, you need some sort of contact information to deal with lost
passwords on any account.  In this day and age, that's an email address.
 Like I said *every* web based management system for OpenSim has added
this field, because it's really required for just about any system.

Agreed.  This is going to open up a whole other discussion on reasonable
reaping strategies, which needs to happen.  However, if we think of
assets sort of like inodes in a filesystem, and inventory like hard
links, it does make sense to have the a/ctimes on assets (mtime is
thrown out as assets can't be modified).
