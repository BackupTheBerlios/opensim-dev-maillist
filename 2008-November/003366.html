<PRE>Hi everybdoy.

I played a bit with open sim recently and found the following behaviour with scripts:

1. A script is starting fresh after a sim start.
2. A script is starting fresh after rezzing it's containing prim.
3. A script is not surviving a sim border crossing.

Especially the last point is of interest (thinking about vehicles, esp. sail boat) for me but I think all these issues are somewhat related.

This behaviour is different to SL but I haven't followed related discussions to closely the last months.

Point 1 and 2 indicate that there is no (or a faulty) persistance for scripts, point 3 seems to be related to point 1 and 2 as a working persitance could be a way to implement sim crossings for scripts (smarter and more efficient ways can surely be imagined). Thus I'm also interested in point 1 and 2.


So here a few questions:

a) Is the observed behaviour correct or maybe depending on the right script engine?
b) Is is a bug? Or a known &quot;todo&quot;?
c) Or is it by design and will not be changed?

d) If it's an open point, is somebody still working on it? Or working on related issues so that I should talk to her/him?

best regards
Gerhard
