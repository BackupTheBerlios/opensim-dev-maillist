<PRE>I was suggesting a secondary mantis project for it.

IE: so it's a separate 'namespace' of issues.

Wouldn't this possibly flood mantis? Maybe it should go to some other database first and then go to mantis after it's been sorted and tabulated so it wouldn't generate duplicates?

The subject has been raised recently, in anticipation of the 0.6.0 release about including an automated bug report process in OpenSim, obviously it would be switched off by default, but the option would exist to have exceptions logged in OpenSim reported to the Mantis bug tracker automatically.



The big advantage to doing so is it becomes easier to prioritise which bugs need to be fixed - issues which occur frequently would immediately become visible (whereas right now they aren't so much). It would also allow us to get some debug feedback on features we implement - ie internal exceptions which we ignore right now could be dumped onto the mantis with appropriate tags.



The solution I am considering for implementing this is the MantisConnect .NET adapter which basically uses the mantis SOAP interface - right now we've got a section of code in the main OpenSim.exe which handles the 'last exception' - I'd like to put the code initially in there, then open the option up for developers to report bugs via a 'Util' member function at a later point.



In terms of Mantis itself, I'm thinking it might be best to setup a second project for the automated reports - while we lose the ability to then link issues as 'related' with a manual report, it also avoids cluttering up the project with thousands of automated reports.



Thoughts?
