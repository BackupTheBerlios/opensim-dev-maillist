Perhaps what is really needed here is some performance benchmarks 
which highlight existing problems? So for individual
changes to lockless versions we better see what improvements we'd
get on both small and large SMP machines and whether its worth the
increase in complexity.

I did some debugging of a deadlock a couple of weeks ago and found it
already pretty complicated. Any suggestions on how other people
approach these problems with OpenSim? I sprinkled lots of console
messages around as mdb doesn't seem to work for me, but in retrospect
it would have been really handy to have been able to just turn on
a lock debugging flag and have debug output when locks are taken
and released.

Regards,

Chris
