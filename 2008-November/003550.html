One large and complex class to make the other logic everywhere much 
simpler. A worthwhile tradeoff, i'd say.

Yes. It puts that complexity in one place, rather than all over. I'd 
rather have one central point wher ethis is checked, than having to 
check it in tens of places.

</I>
Keeping consistency is mostly the responsibility of the link/unlink 
code. Which I already volunteered to write and maintain, if that was 
all that's stopping it.

&gt;<i>

</I>
If using automatic dot net serialization, that may be so. If using 
manual serialization, it doesn't have to be so.

In the database, we have that now. There is no rootprims and 
childprims table, just prims.

&gt;<i> At the moment I'm actually leaning towards the single LLEntity suggestion, though I'm a little concerned about the 
</I>&gt;<i> duplication that ends up at the database/serialization level.  But I'd really like to hear what other people think.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Well, I'd be on blard to help make sure it results in an elegant, 
easy to use class that is a joy to manipulate
