<PRE>As I plow ahead with the hypergrid, I ran into an interesting situation 
that can be considered a bug or a feature. I wonder what people think of 
this.

I'm running into a mechanism for providing grid/user-specific items, 
which is something that I heard being discussed here before as a 
&quot;feature&quot;, especially for games. It's sort of jerky right now, because 
of the viewer's cache. And this is an accidental surprise on the way to 
implementing the new region asset cache.

I'm wondering whether this should be considered a feature to be enhanced 
or something to get rid of altogether when the hypergrid asset cache is 
implemented. Maybe do this for items that are acquired in some foreign 
grids? Something like &quot;what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas&quot;? 
(configurable at grid or region level, of course)

If you want to try:

1 - Log on to OSGrid, find your way to a region called UCI Welcome
2 - On that region, pull up the map and search for ucigrid
3 - Teleport there -- you're out of OSGrid
4 - Fiddle with your inventory while in the UCIGrid. The existing items 
will not be rezzable. But upload textures, &quot;take&quot; objects, and create 
scripts, for example
5 - When you want to go back, pull up the map and locate the OSGrid Gateway
6 - Teleport, you're back to OSGrid
7 - Check what happened to the items you created in UCIGrid. Some assets 
(textures) will be available because they are in your viewer's cache. 
But others (e.g. scripts) won't.
8 - Go back to the UCIGrid, and verify that all those items are 
available there, especially the scripts.

As usual, this live demo is only available until one of the region 
crashes/freezes (which has been happening a lot in recent opensim 
releases). And expect bumps...
