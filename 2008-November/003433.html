<PRE>I definitely do not want to upset Nebadon I have tons of his scripts on my
grid in use and as giveaways but I link to the OSG forum page where I got
each script and add the scripters name and of course leave their copyright
info in place.  So don&#8217;t cut me off Neb! Your scripts are amazing and
examples that I use daily to show how far OpenSim has come.

all im saying is OpenLifeGrid is no longer an OpenSimulator grid and will no
longer be listed as such, im not trying to say that openlife has not played
a part in opensim, but their non participation in Opensimulator is nothing
more than they are using the code, previously and now they no longer are,
anyone working on the project directly knows this, they have not contributed
code or been a part of any opensimulator development discussions this year
at all, if someone can disprove to me that they are contributing anything at
all back to opensim i would be willing to listen, but even Tribal has
contributed back to this project quite alot, more so than most infact.  But
just like you do not see any reference to Realxtend on the opensimulator.org
website, i really see no need to list non-opensimulator grids in our grid
list, has nothing to do with politics.  Lets talk more about it i suppose.
Perhaps a new section for projects spawned from OpenSIM??
