<PRE>I mean being able to do:

PrimDBType.Meta[&quot;blah&quot;] = new MetaField();

And having that serialise into the DB as a metadata field.

Not fully groking you, but I would say that we would come a long step if we made sure all data sources were abstracted by a provider, so for example user profiles had its own provider, search had its et c.

Remember, any given class (like a local user service proxy) can implement several provider interfaces, and thusly serve multiple roles - there's no real penalty to let separate context use separate interfaces to the same class, but it opens up for redirection and customization.

I'd love to have a DB pattern which better supported metadata myself.

There's been several occasions right now where it would have been handy to attach extra fields of data in (even if they cant be searched on easily).

I agree with Stefan, we have too much data mixed together in the dbs. Avatar appearance for instance. I don't believe that should be part of user data. We should either have it as part of the Inventory/Asset data or a separate Avatar  data set.

Mixing all the data together like we do, really makes it hand to make changes to the backends. And to make custom applications that function in a different manor to the standard opensim setup.

I'm also unsure we really need a email field as part of the opensim db. I would think that should be part of the website account data. Which I believe most likely should be separate from opensim data.

The more data we have mixed together in the db's. The hander/ more work it becomes to maintain a opensim installation; to update it when changes are made to the database structures.


For 0.6, lets think about some new layouts, to make things easier to customize and maintain?

It is my firm belief, based on numerous integrations with custom backends, that we should separate the 'user' concept from the 'avatar' concept. On all Tribal Medias productions, the user logs on with a user id, not avatar first/last. In the real world (aka non-sl-grid world) it makes sense to separate them in the db.

Maybe the cross-section would be the 'agent' - and in the simplest of instances, agentId == userId == avatarId.

What I mean is that an asset was uploaded and accessed by an 'agent', not a 'user' or an 'avatar'. This should be reflected in the tables as well.

As you say, e-mail in user information should be non-controversial, but it does highlight the difference between users and avatars. Does the OpenSim database actually reflect users? Or avatars? I thought the latter. What purpose will the e-mail address serve? I think there maybe more reluctance to provide this information than you might think. I'm prsonally nearly as opressed by providing my e-mail as I am my telephone number.

Create time, given its one-to-one correspondence with an asset seems OK to me, but I think there is probably room for lots of discussion on ways to determine currency.

[Opensim-dev] Proposed additional db fields







I've got a couple of proposed db fields that I think we should add in,
but I want feedback before just putting it in.

users:
* email - this is added by a lot of the web based management stacks,
and would be really handy to be in the base user definition.  I suspect
this is non controversial.

assets:
* create_time - the unix timestamp when the asset is created
* access_time - the unix timestamp for last asset access

The rationale for these asset additional fields was some brainstorming
this weekend on how we'd ever support asset reaping.  Why not perfect,
this may help in determining what are active assets, and what are
ancient assets that may be suitable for reaping.  Without these bits of
information, we've got a hard time here.

Comments welcomed,

                -Sean
