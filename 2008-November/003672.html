<PRE>So Adam, or anyone else that wants to weigh in on this.  It has been a long
time since I set up an OpenSim grid, so my recollection is a little hazy and
it was probably version 0.5 that I was working with.  Back then, my
recollection is that the OpenSim.ini file had configuration lines for the
region to contact grid, asset and user servers.  Typically, these were URIs
using IPv4 addresses.  However, if I understand what you are saying
properly, if grid, user, or asset servers had an IPv6 address, I could use a
URI pointing to the IPv6 server.  Is that right?  Could I use either the
dnsname or the format <A HREF="http://[2001:4860:0:2001::68">http://[2001:4860:0:2001::68</A>]:8001 ?

If this is accurate, does anyone out there have a Grid that can talk on IPv6
to regions and IPv4 to clients?  I would be glad to set up a region which
has IPv6 connectivity to add it to such a grid.  Likewise, I could use IPv6
to connect to an IPv6 enabled IRC server?  Anyone trying that?

I'm interested in learning more and perhaps doing a little testing.

  IPv6 is possible in OpenSim.



  There is nothing particularly hard-coded to IPv4 &#150; all our internal use of
IPAddress for instance natively supports IPv6 addresses.



  However.



  The second life viewer is very IPv4 coded, including large sections of the
protocol &#150; such as the simulatorenable/disable methods, etc.



  Perhaps when we have some alternate clients in &#150; we can look at enabling
IPv6 in the clients that will support it.

  I've been playing with IPv6 a bit here in the States as well and would
love to run an IPv6 enabled OpenSim.  I'm curious to hear what it would
take.

    Subject: [Opensim-dev] IPv6

    Hi all,

    Is-it possible to add to the OpenSimulator wish-list the support of IPv6
stack please?

    I make this request because more &amp; more european ISP provide /64 or /56
IPv6 prefix and the end for IPv4 is not so close (first quarter 2010).

    Thanks for all.

    Regards,

    Stephane.
