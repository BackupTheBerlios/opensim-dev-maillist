<PRE>Well, it depends a little bit on your projects and their timeframes.

There's quite a few people putting professional projects ontop of OpenSim right now (Shenlei's project is probably the most visible of these). But anyone doing so needs to be prepared to spend some time stabilising and hardening OpenSim, and also be prepared to encounter bugs.

If you need a SL clone, and you need it today - I'd probably send you to Linden Lab. If you have something else though that really needs an application platform, and your prepared to spend some time developing it - then OpenSim can be a perfect partner.

I don't know maybe someone else will offer there services but I think people wanting make money on it should play around with it trial and error and learn as much as they can by reading the wiki: <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page</A>

Also remember this is consider a Beta/Alpha software and you will never be able to fully run a stable service so make sure you offer a full refund as the last thing we would want to hear is people getting scammed with the opesim core :(

Hi guys,

I'm involved in a startup business thats using opensim as part of its core offering.

Is anyone out there interested in providing consultancy (paid for of course) to help us
get up to speed on the opensim archtitecture?

We're particularly interested in getting detailed archtictural documentation to help us get up to speed quicky as there is
quite an extensive codebase.

Thanks for your help

       Sean
