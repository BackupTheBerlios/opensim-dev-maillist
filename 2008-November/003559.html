<PRE>If we do it this way, could we have an base class containing just the link descriptions, and recursive handling of properties to sequential parents?

IE:

        BaseSop : IEntity {
                List&lt;BaseSop&gt; m_parents;
                List&lt;BaseSop&gt; m_childroons;

                void ForeachParent(delegate(BaseSop e) x);
                ... etc

                Position
                Name
                ID
                Scale
                Rotation
                ... etc
        }

Then if this is embedded everywhere we might stand a chance of having it useful for other VW's than SL. (IE the SL-specific properties (like say 'Shape') go into LLSop : BaseSop)

Adam

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Cons
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1.  LLEntity becomes very large and potentially complex.  SOG and
</I>&gt;<i> SOP are already large and complex.  It may be possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to improve this by further refactoring.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One large and complex class to make the other logic everywhere much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simpler. A worthwhile tradeoff, i'd say.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I disagree - any large and complex class is a result to be
</I>&gt;<i> avoided.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, as I said, I suspect that it could be broken up somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> (unless you want absolutely everything in a single
</I>&gt;<i> class on principle).  For instance, all the inventory stuff should
</I>&gt;<i> really be in a separate class, especially as one can
</I>&gt;<i> imagine virtual environments either where prims don't have inventory,
</I>&gt;<i> or where inventory is handled different (e.g. an
</I>&gt;<i> inventory for the whole object rather than for individual prims).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2.  Every setting and getting of a property in LLEntity has to
</I>&gt;<i> delegate up to its root LLEntity unless it is the root.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Therefore, code such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes. It puts that complexity in one place, rather than all over. I'd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather have one central point wher ethis is checked, than having to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; check it in tens of places.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's going to look pretty messy.  Almost every single property and
</I>&gt;<i> method would need to potentially delegate up to a
</I>&gt;<i> root entity.  If we ever get to deeply linked sets this could add up to
</I>&gt;<i> quite a few method calls.  However, I personally
</I>&gt;<i> don't think this is an issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; One also needs to be careful to set the publicly available property
</I>&gt;<i> so that delegation happens if required, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the private field to avoid state such as 'attached' becoming
</I>&gt;<i> inconsistent (this is a potential source of bugs).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Keeping consistency is mostly the responsibility of the link/unlink
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code. Which I already volunteered to write and maintain, if that was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all that's stopping it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One person writing and maintaining is a bad solution.  The code should
</I>&gt;<i> be written in such a way that as many people can
</I>&gt;<i> maintain it and safely change it as possible, not just one person.  But
</I>&gt;<i> I do agree that maintaining consistency would
</I>&gt;<i> only be a problem within the entity class itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 3.  It leads to an increase in property duplication at the database
</I>&gt;<i> and serialization levels.  Every LLEntity will have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a set of fields, even though some of those conceptually only apply
</I>&gt;<i> to a linkset/SceneObjectGroup.  This probably isn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; serious but I think that it will make things harder to work with at
</I>&gt;<i> those levels.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If using automatic dot net serialization, that may be so. If using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manual serialization, it doesn't have to be so.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the database, we have that now. There is no rootprims and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; childprims table, just prims.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's true, though arguably for some properties this isn't correct.
</I>&gt;<i> For instance, region handle is present in every
</I>&gt;<i> prim even though it arguably only ever applies to objects as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i> This forces us to have extra code for locking and
</I>&gt;<i> making sure things are consistent (though under a 'root entity' scheme
</I>&gt;<i> this largely wouldn't be an issue, as long as
</I>&gt;<i> people set properties rather than member fields directly).  Anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> there aren't many such properties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; At the moment I'm actually leaning towards the single LLEntity
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion, though I'm a little concerned about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; duplication that ends up at the database/serialization level.  But
</I>&gt;<i> I'd really like to hear what other people think.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, I'd be on blard to help make sure it results in an elegant,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easy to use class that is a joy to manipulate
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I'm leaning towards this now.  However, I'd still like to wait
</I>&gt;<i> until the weekend, at least, for any other input.
</I>&gt;<i> This change will require code changes in lots of areas, including some
</I>&gt;<i> currently being worked (such as the EntitiesList)
</I>&gt;<i> so it would be good to try and see if anybody can see any major
</I>&gt;<i> obstacles ahead before plunging in.
