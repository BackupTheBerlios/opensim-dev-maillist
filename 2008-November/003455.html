<PRE>
I just want to make sure everybody understands that I don't give a rats ass about whether OLG is 'on the list' or not. And I share MW's standpoint on that particular case.
 
I was merely trying to instigate reflection upon whether that page is there at all. Is it a &quot;these grids are recommended starting points&quot; page, &quot;add your cool grid here&quot; page, or &quot;these are OpenSim partners/affiliates&quot; page, or a &quot;these grids are known to be based off our software&quot; page.
 
We should always strive for professionalism in dealing with the outside world, and having clear policies for stuff like this, is part of being that.
 
Otherwise we'll degerate in &quot;yes! no! yes!&quot; squabbling.

They have also given back a lot less than looking through the SVN logs would suggest, as a lot of the old commits which said sponsered/provided by OpenLife grid, shouldn't have.But the bigger factor here, I believe is that they do seemed to totally have forked from opensim. Are no longer giving anything back. And seem to do everything they can to avoid be associated with Opensim, unless it is to their benefit.Is all this enough for them to be removed from the grid list? I'm not sure. I wouldn't have removed them myself, but I'm fine with going along with it if its what other believe should happen. Why should we help them when they have done everything they can to hurt a lot of the people in the opensim community.One thing I think we should be clear on is that Openlife Grid isn't RealXtend. It might be running their code, but thats all. Seems to be some mixing up going on here, with people considering RealXtend and Openlife Grid as the same entity. While RealXtend have forked they are trying to give as much back to OpenSim as possible. With the modules that they are working on.Justin Clark-Casey &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">jjustincc at googlemail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

No apparant ill &gt; effects on a sniff test.Those were patches that were 9 months old, which is why they have low mantis numbers. It was only when some community volunteers went through the bug database that they were brought back to our attention and we did something about them (though I think there's still one hanging about somewhere).I don't have anything against proprietary development - I myself belong to a company that does some of this. But if you just take from the pot and don't contribute back according to your means, then I don't blame people for not feeling that the organization is not a real member of the community.&gt; &gt; &gt; These don't count??&gt; &gt; what exactly is the cutoff date so everyone can know?? and again, &gt; OpenLibrary has nothing to do with it.. Its beneficial to everyone. &gt; the only reason Im point this out at all is I was downloading a new &gt; verision because my computer died and I'm running linux now..I went to &gt; get the library and its now missing... that made me very curious.&gt; &gt; and im even more curious now.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2008/11/4 Kyle G &gt;&gt; &gt; I definitely do not want to upset Nebadon I have tons of his scripts&gt; on my grid in use and as giveaways but I link to the OSG forum page&gt; where I got each script and add the scripters name and of course&gt; leave their copyright info in place. So don't cut me off Neb! Your&gt; scripts are amazing and examples that I use daily to show how far&gt; OpenSim has come.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *From:* <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">opensim-dev-bounces at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; &gt; [mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">opensim-dev-bounces at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; ] *On Behalf Of&gt; *Nebadon Izumi&gt; *Sent:* Tuesday, November 04, 2008 4:53 PM&gt; &gt; *To:* <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A> &gt; *Subject:* Re: [Opensim-dev] User vs Avatar [WAS: Proposed&gt; additional db fields]&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all im saying is OpenLifeGrid is no longer an OpenSimulator grid and&gt; will no longer be listed as such, im not trying to say that openlife&gt; has not played a part in opensim, but their non participation in&gt; Opensimulator is nothing more than they are using the code,&gt; previously and now they no longer are, anyone working on the project&gt; directly knows this, they have not contributed code or been a part&gt; of any opensimulator development discussions this year at all, if&gt; someone can disprove to me that they are contributing anything at&gt; all back to opensim i would be willing to listen, but even Tribal&gt; has contributed back to this project quite alot, more so than most&gt; infact. But just like you do not see any reference to Realxtend on&gt; the opensimulator.org website, i really&gt; see no need to list non-opensimulator grids in our grid list, has&gt; nothing to do with politics. Lets talk more about it i suppose. &gt; Perhaps a new section for projects spawned from OpenSIM??&gt; &gt; No virus found in this incoming message.&gt; Checked by AVG - <A HREF="http://www.avg.com">http://www.avg.com</A>&gt; Version: 8.0.175 / Virus Database: 270.8.4/1754 - Release Date:&gt; 11/3/2008 7:46 AM&gt; &gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A> &gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev--">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev--</A> justinccJustin Clark-<A HREF="Caseyhttp://justincc.wordpress.com_______________________________________________Opensim-dev">Caseyhttp://justincc.wordpress.com_______________________________________________Opensim-dev</A> mailing <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">listOpensim-dev at lists.berlios.dehttps</A>://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev
