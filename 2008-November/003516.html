<PRE>Dear Todd:

I'm going to weigh in here and suggest that it would help all of us if one or more members of OpenLifeGrid could participate in the OpenSim community a bit more. As you know, our community communicates on this mailing list, the opensim-users mailing list, the FreeNode #opensim channel and the FreeNode #opensim-dev channel.

I suspect that many of the feelings expressed recently about OpenLifeGrid have to do with the real or perceived lack of participation in our community and I would urge you and others at OpenLifeGrid to help rectify that perception by participating. After all, we all become stronger by our community participation, so this is of some importance to all of us.

Charles

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Security and ClientView

&quot;oh yea and btw everyone
OpenLifeGrid has played absolutly no role in developing OpenSimulator,
if you think im lieing do some research and you will also find
OpenLifeGrid was nothing more than a OpenSimulator User, not a
developer, they have done ZERO DEVELOPMENT on opensimulator project.
and now they forked into a new project and no longer run OpenSimulator
and are no longer recognized as an opensimulator Grid by the OpenSIM
team. join me in irc.freenode.net #opensim to get the truth.&quot;

You can really back this up??  It sounds like ranting to me.   Of course OpenLifeGrid has contributed...

And at least our system runs on real servers...


&quot;Like i said come to osgrid.org i will give you a server and you can prove it too me, i have never ever seen anyone get 45k prims into a simulator ever under any circumstance, you are both wrong and i will prove it to you and anyone who wishes to see it proven.. DONT TALK SHOW ME!! all you talkers need to shut up and do some work to prove your claims.&quot;

Do you want more? or is 45,400 enough?  That took 17 minutes and no problems with 5-10 people watching over my shoulder..

Anyone can come to Bourbon Street @ OpenLifeGrid to see for themselves.

No need for silly drama any more.  We guarantee 45,000 prims - we deliver!
