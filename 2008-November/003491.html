<PRE>As one who has spent a lot of time in InnerScene with the local 
dragons, I see that in lots of cases, even having it InnerScene at 
all complicates things horrendously.
There are actions that change between Scene and InnerScene 4 times 
to get the job done. That could be done much more efficiently if 
those methods were combined and then split up into functional units, 
rather than &quot;3d&quot; scoped.

One flow I found was like this:

Caller calls Scene:A
Scene:A calls InnerScene:A
Scene:A calls Scene:B
Scene:A calls InnerScene:C
InnerScene:C calls Scene:C
Scene:A returns.

This is overcomplex and baffling to new coders. I am not surprised 
that many people choose not to touch it.

Needless to say, I removed the above flow and made it into a single 
call into InnerScene. It was part of attachment rezzing. When i did 
that, I streamlined that flow.

I believe InnerScene and Scene should not be separate, or not be 
separated along the line they are separated now.

On the name, I don't really care.

+-0 there.

</I>&gt;<i> A long time ago, we started the process of separating the 3d scene handling code into its own class, rather than having it mixed in with more region level code, like rezzing/inventory handling.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It was always planned to renamed the InnerScene and Scene classes, once this separation of the 3d scene graph code was completed. The original plan being that Scene became Region (or something like that) and InnerScene changed to Scene.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It might be a bit to much work to rename the Scene class at this stage. But what are everyone thoughts on renaming InnerScene to something like SceneGraph.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the InnerScene class is one of the more confusing areas as a lot new coders aren't really aware what design role it is meant to play.
