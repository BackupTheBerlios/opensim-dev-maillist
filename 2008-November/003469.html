On the subject of the flood now as I missed that; I don't personally think that this will be such a horrible issue at least for the time being. I mean unless we have millions of opensim users running simultaneously the probability for so many crashes to occur at the same time is very small. Don't forget this will also be turned off by default, which will make it even more rare for too many reports to take place at the same time.

So overall I believe that if 10000 opensim users are running simultaneously for lets say an hour, in that hour there wouldn't be more then 100 crashes overall (unless someone really pushes their luck with a setting there). Not something anyone can just predict but just the most probable thought. Now given the fact that not more then 15% of the users the users there would even bother running the auto-reporter... not much at all for the time being. -And- given the fact that duplicate issues would only be checked and ignored when found, the flood should be really really small.

If flood is proven to be a real problem however, we could add a flood limit on Mantis and if the traffic is too big make the auto-reporter application wait a few seconds before reporting if possible.
