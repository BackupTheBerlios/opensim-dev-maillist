<PRE>Harrumph! I agree with Stefan on separating the user from the Avatar.

[mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">opensim-dev-bounces at lists.berlios.de</A>] On Behalf Of Stefan Andersson

It is my firm belief, based on numerous integrations with custom backends,
that we should separate the 'user' concept from the 'avatar' concept. On all
Tribal Medias productions, the user logs on with a user id, not avatar
first/last. In the real world (aka non-sl-grid world) it makes sense to
separate them in the db.
 
Maybe the cross-section would be the 'agent' - and in the simplest of
instances, agentId == userId == avatarId.
 
What I mean is that an asset was uploaded and accessed by an 'agent', not a
'user' or an 'avatar'. This should be reflected in the tables as well.

Best regards,
Stefan Andersson

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Proposed additional db fields


As you say, e-mail in user information should be non-controversial, but it
does highlight the difference between users and avatars. Does the OpenSim
database actually reflect users? Or avatars? I thought the latter. What
purpose will the e-mail address serve? I think there maybe more reluctance
to provide this information than you might think. I'm prsonally nearly as
opressed by providing my e-mail as I am my telephone number. 

Create time, given its one-to-one correspondence with an asset seems OK to
me, but I think there is probably room for lots of discussion on ways to
determine currency. 



Best regards

[Opensim-dev] Proposed additional db fields
 
		



I've got a couple of proposed db fields that I think we should add in,
but I want feedback before just putting it in.

users:
* email - this is added by a lot of the web based management stacks,
and would be really handy to be in the base user definition.  I suspect
this is non controversial.

assets:
* create_time - the unix timestamp when the asset is created
* access_time - the unix timestamp for last asset access

The rationale for these asset additional fields was some brainstorming
this weekend on how we'd ever support asset reaping.  Why not perfect,
this may help in determining what are active assets, and what are
ancient assets that may be suitable for reaping.  Without these bits of
information, we've got a hard time here.

Comments welcomed,

                -Sean
