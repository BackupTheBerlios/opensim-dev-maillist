+1 fo sho.
 
Also, I would love if there was any kind of room for 'fortifying' a given version branch within the repo.
 
I mean, when we tagged 0.6.0, could we have a branch that was dedicated to just applying bug-fixes, and stabilizing fixes to?
 
We've already said that we don't have the resources within the project to do proper release cycle, but could we at least have somewhere for people who want to work on stability over features for a given version? I know it would definitively help with my debugging motivation to have one there - and believe it or not, but in the majority of cases, you can actually apply the changes directly into the next version as well.
 
How about a 0.6.0_fortified branch? Or some other numbering, perhaps?
 
So, 0.6.1 would be bugfixes + ongoing development,
0.6.0_fortified would only be bugfixes, and done only by those who actually find the motivation to work on fortification of a given version.Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A>

I&#8217;d like to propose switching our version numbering schemes to something similar to how the Linux Kernel used to operate, whereby we have unstable and stable version numbers independent of each other.
 
For instance,
 
0.6.0 is a stable release
0.6.1 is under development
0.6.2 is stable, etc.
 
 
So as soon as we tag a stable release, we then increment the version number straight away up to an odd number to indicate that we&#8217;re now working on potentially a not so stable version, when it returns to stability, we tag it again to an even number, add the tag &amp; release, then increment back to an unstable one.
 
This way, when users say they are using 0.6.X, we can quickly determine if they are on a stable supported release, or bleeding edge.
 
Thoughts?
