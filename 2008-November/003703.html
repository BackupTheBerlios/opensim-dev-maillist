<PRE>There's something else in opensim that adds to the confusion: 
ScenePresence, which seems to be a composite between client, agent, and 
avatar. Specifically, ScenePresence is the thing that makes agents 
become root/child. ScenePresences are created when new clients are created.

As far as I can tell, ScenePresence is being treated as Avatar, but I'm 
not sure this is conceptually correct. When a scene presence is 
associated with a child agent, there is no avatar.

</I>&gt;<i> I love that this thread is still alive, +1 on cleaning the whole thing

</I>&gt;<i> actually coding was rather confused themselves, and to a certain

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Also, +1 on separating them more. I have posted several times to this

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Authentication&quot; or &quot;Membership&quot; - since a user can actually use 
</I>&gt;<i> several authentication schemes to authenticate his agent, and there 
</I>&gt;<i> might not be any RL user at all (as in the case with services).
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Also, consider the potential relationships and permutations between 
</I>&gt;<i> these entitites. A user can have an avatar, but no agent. Or we can

</I>&gt;<i> These are often confusing terms. I'd like to throw out some simplistic 
</I>&gt;<i> straw dog definitions and hopefully set a path towards a consensus.I 
</I>&gt;<i> haven't traced through the OpenSimulator code enough to know if these 
</I>&gt;<i> definitions fit well in this implementation, but rather I am lead to 
</I>&gt;<i> believe these definitions are somewhat fitting through my experiences 
</I>&gt;<i> with SL I suspect some will have differing opinions on these 
</I>&gt;<i> definitions so please reply with any corrections that may help towards 
</I>&gt;<i> a consensus or better represent their use in the code base.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> User - a person who interacts with the service. A user will create an 
</I>&gt;<i> account, use the service through the viewer software and web sites, 
</I>&gt;<i> and possibly eventually delete the account.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agent - that which represents the user for simulation purposes. An 
</I>&gt;<i> agent would need a consistent means of identification while it is 
</I>&gt;<i> actively part of the simulation and this identification should be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to link the agent to the user's account so it can be associated with 
</I>&gt;<i> inventory, assets, and communication. An agent will be associated with 
</I>&gt;<i> a physics proxy which will be used to model interactions with the 
</I>&gt;<i> simulated physical environment. An agent would serve as a 
</I>&gt;<i> communications focal point and relay this communication between scene 
</I>&gt;<i> chat, group or personal instant messages, and the user's viewer session.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Avatar - the graphical representation of both an agent and a user that 
</I>&gt;<i> appears on the viewer screen of those using the service. It operates 
</I>&gt;<i> in tandem with the agent in that it moves in the scene as the agent 
</I>&gt;<i> proxy moves in the simulation scene, and it is usually controlled 
</I>&gt;<i> along with the agent by the user.  Software may interact with both the 
</I>&gt;<i> agent and the avatar, such as in physical movement and collisions, or 
</I>&gt;<i> it may interact solely with the avatar, such as in appearance or 
</I>&gt;<i> animation.

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I've been noticing that there is a certain confusion in the code about
</I>&gt;<i>     the names of methods and fields when it comes to denoting a user
</I>&gt;<i>     vs. an
</I>&gt;<i>     agent vs. an avatar. That could be cleaned up, eventually, if
</I>&gt;<i>     someone is
</I>&gt;<i>     up for a little bit of renaming. But there seems to be a deeper
</I>&gt;<i>     confusion in the data structures themselves, and that's much
</I>&gt;<i>     nastier to
</I>&gt;<i>     deal with. Specifically, agents take the UUIDs of the users they
</I>&gt;<i>     represent, instead of having a UUID of their own and pointing to the
</I>&gt;<i>     user. By doing this, the separation between user and agent is
</I>&gt;<i>     defeated.
</I>&gt;<i>     Also, AgentCircuitData takes a copy of the first and last names of the
</I>&gt;<i>     users they represent, and this is a bit fragile when one wants to
</I>&gt;<i>     process the names of users in interesting ways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I really like the conceptual separation of those 3 things. I can
</I>&gt;<i>     imagine
</I>&gt;<i>     situations where it is advantageous for a single user to be logged in
</I>&gt;<i>     several times -- e.g. wanting to attend multiple events at the
</I>&gt;<i>     same time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Is this &quot;id collapse&quot; being done for optimization? Or is this one of
</I>&gt;<i>     those things that made it to the code and never got challenged? Or is
</I>&gt;<i>     this a well-known TODO?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     This is not urgent, I'm just wondering what the story is.
</I>&gt;<i>
