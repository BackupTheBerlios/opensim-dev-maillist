Diva et al,
 
for some time I have been playing with the idea of externalizing the local map creation and interaction into a module. I don't know how much of this is already in the hypergrid, but;
 
The hypermap module -
 
* All map items would be declared in an xml file - either as singular items (hypergrid links, I guess) - or as references to a map service interface (basically, the grid server url that would serve the getneighbours request for that part of the map) - this would be something like a html 'links' or 'sitemap' page.
 
* All map items would have an optional mapTexture, which would let the region represent the link with a nice picture, not necessary generated from region content, or generated with a much higher and better resolution (take a birds-eye snapshot of the region in the viewer, for example - or a picture of yourself - or a tainted old parchment map for a western game)
 
* On map teleports, the module could re-map the regionhandle of the 'local' map request, to the localhandle fetched from the grid server for that part of the map - and route the teleport accordingly.
Unfortunately I haven't had the time to implement it, but I think it would be a really cool advancement. Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A>

Paul,Your division of logical vs physical space is right on. But I think this is closer to reality, though:1 Logical Space1.1 A region is 65,536 sq. meters and infinite Z space, which provides a 3D space *service*1.2 A Map (logical grid, matrix) contains one or more regions. 1.3 A collection of *services* glue the regions together. Those services are:       grid service, user service, asset service, inventory service, and others.2 Physical spaceThe different *services* mentioned above are implemented by *servers*. Servers can run one or more of those services.2.1 In the simplest case, there is only one server running all the services. This is known as &quot;standalone&quot;.2.2 In another common configuration, one or more servers run the 3D space service (1 or more regions per server) and independent servers run the glue services. This common configuration is known as &quot;grid&quot;.Paul Fishwick wrote: 
Here is a suggested rewrite. Hopefully, I have
not confused matters:

1. Logical Space (map) is defined as follows:

   1.1 A Grid contains one or more Regions,
         where each region is managed by
         a different Region Server. A Grid map
         is indexed by Grid coordinates.
         [Example: OSGrid]
   1.2 A Sim contains one or more Regions,
         where each region is managed by
          the same Region Server. A Sim map is
          indexed by Sim coordinates.
   1.3 A Region is 65,536 sq. meters, and
         contains one or more Parcels
      

2. Physical space (architecture) is defined as follows:

    2.1 StandAlone Mode is one computer running
          one Sim (one instance of OpenSim).
    2.2 Grid Mode is one or more computers in the
          following configurations:
          2.2.1  Region Server: Region servers  are
                    defined by an instance of OpenSim, and
                    they are clients of the Grid Server.
                    [Example: a region that connects to OSGrid]
          2.2.2  Grid Server: Grid servers (UGAIM) connect
                    the Region Servers together to form a Grid.
                    [Example: OSGrid servers]
     2.3  Hypergrid Mode is a hyperlinked configuration
            involving Sims and Grids

A Region is the same thing as a Sim (65,536 sq. meters)
    
      Rightly or wrongly, I've been making a distinction between those two
terms since using Opensim, although they're pretty much equivalent in
SL:

- A Region is a 64K area
- A Sim is an instance of OpenSim.exe

A single Sim can host several Regions; Linden tend to run each Region
in a separate Sim, so they can be split in hardware terms, but I
prefer to run my four Regions with just one Sim, and this is normal
for Opensim.
