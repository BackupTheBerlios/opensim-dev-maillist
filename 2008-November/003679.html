<PRE>This is just a &quot;me too&quot; message with regard to Hypergrid and ODE, and a
general mesh question in part (3).

(1) Hypergrid

I've been experimenting around with Hypergrid, and this has a real
potential for laying
the virtual groundwork for world cross-linkage and small community
building -- something missing. The problem of
<A HREF="https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/SVC-2941">https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/SVC-2941</A> is
significant since one has to know, ahead of time, where grids locate themselves,
but hopefully that will be fixed. In the mean time, having this part
of the release
seems really good. In a release incorporating the hypergrid, would there be
an opensim.ini (rather than the current approach using a command line option)?

(2) ODE

We have done some small robot work here using OpenGL, OGRE, and ODE so
having this capability in OpenSim seems to make a lot of sense. I
suppose there is
always the issue of server load (where ODE is running) but that can be
at the discretion
of the server admin.

(3) Mesh Loads

Do you think it possible to employ an osl function for loading an arbitrary mesh
(similar to what is attempting to be done in RealXtend) ? I've looked
through some
of the code in meshmerizer, and while this was a cursory inspection,
all of the prims
seem to be already based on meshes, suggesting that to allow arbitrary
mesh loads
could be straightforward. Thoughts?
