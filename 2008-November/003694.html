<PRE>Well, this Mac G5 has had Fedora 9 Linux installed by me, so I dont think the dylib's affect the situation.

I have been able to compile openjpeg-dotnet.dll from our svn and can get the &quot;Mac Land&quot; region up and running on OSGrid. The issue currently is that the region crashes with a mono thread spew when a login occurs. It looks like mono threads are getting wrapped all around each other as the crash occurs at different times in the login process.

For today, I am calling success at getting Linux installed, the source compiled with mono/nant and the region inserting itself into the grid. Fedora 9 comes with mono-1.9.1, which is just about the latest. 

I am a little puzzled as to whether the system is running as 32bit or 64bit in Linux. Is there any way to tell? Although the install DVD iso image comes only one way, I assume it is 64bit. 

So, some puzzles are solved and a few others are surfacing.

Charles

OSX uses .dylib files for unmanaged (non-.NET) code, not .dll or
.so. I would say make sure you have libopenjpeg-2.1.3.0-dotnet-1.dylib (or
something like that) but the fact that Mono is trying to access
openjpeg-dotnet.dll means the DllMap seems to have failed. Make sure you have
OpenMetaverse.dll.config in that directory, and that it contains a DllMap entry
from openjpeg-dotnet.dll to the actual .dylib binary in your bin/ directory.
 
On a side note, I&#8217;ve been looking into a fully managed JPEG2000
codec. It&#8217;s quite a ways from complete right now (and certainly slower than
unmanaged code), but might prove useful for certain specific tasks.

To amplify a
tiny bit, the exception says basically:

System.DllNotFoundException: openjpeg-dotnet.dll.

The issue right now seems to be that an &quot;ls open* -la&quot; shows this
file exists and is marked executable. So, I think there may be an underlying
.so that is non existent at this point.

$ ls open*.dll -la
-rwxrwxr-x 1 ckrinke ckrinke 196608 2008-11-23 11:03 openjpeg-dotnet.dll
[

On a functioning x86 server, I can see libopenjpeg-1.0.0.so and other files
that are not on this Mac G5 in our opensim/bin/ directory. I did try copying
the the files from /usr/lib that appear to be concerned with jpeg to our
opensim/bin directory like this:

$ cp /usr/lib/libjp*.so* .

And the region still has the same System.DllNotFoundException.

So, anyone that can shed a little light on this puzzle would help me get some
additional testing setup.

Charles

I
have a Mac G5 available for testing for a little while and have installed
Fedora 9 on it.

I can get OpenSim.exe compiled and the region up on OSGrid. There are a couple
of issues. One solved, one not solved.

ODE: Using our wiki, I was able to make ODE. I observe that we seem to need to
initialize ODE even when ODE is not specified in the OpenSim.ini file. We might
want to eliminate that dependency.

The region does come up, but has a jpeg exception which is at the end of this
email. At this point, I am a little puzzled with our various jpeg .so, .dll and
such that are in svn. Looks like we are supplying an x86 version binary from
svn.

In any case, a little help in getting past this jpeg exception would let me get
to where we can test a bit more on a 64bit Mac G5.
