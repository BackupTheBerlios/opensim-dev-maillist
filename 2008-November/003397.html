In reality, you need some sort of contact information to deal with lost
passwords on any account.  In this day and age, that's an email address.
 Like I said *every* web based management system for OpenSim has added
this field, because it's really required for just about any system.

Agreed.  This is going to open up a whole other discussion on reasonable
reaping strategies, which needs to happen.  However, if we think of
assets sort of like inodes in a filesystem, and inventory like hard
links, it does make sense to have the a/ctimes on assets (mtime is
thrown out as assets can't be modified).
