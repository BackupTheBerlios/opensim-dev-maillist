<PRE>I'm glad this is getting a generally positive reaction. I believe in the 
hypergrid, or something like it, strongly enough that I'm going to stick 
around and do whatever necessary to see it, or something like it, go 
into the box.

Obviously, I agree with everything said here about revising things 
properly and making sure the edges aren't too rough. I will appreciate 
one or more of your 'older' ones (he!) looking carefully into it. 
Generally, the hypergrid code is cleanly separated from the core code, 
but let me tell you what I see as the main ugliness of this contribution:

The hypergrid touches heavily on Communications and, lightly, on 
Environment.Scenes. Communications isn't as well componentized as other 
things are; for example, the IClientAPI is a wonderful piece of the 
architecture! Unlike that, the construction code for Communications is 
hard-coded in OpenSimBase. Because of that, I had to subclass OpenSim, 
which is very ugly. If there's a way of making Communications a 
component that can be specified in the config file, that would be great! 
Not just for the hypergrid, but it would open the door for 
experimentation with other alternative interoperability ideas.

For the extension on Environment.Scenes, again, the Scene-related 
classes are being hard-coded in OpenSimBase. If there's a way of 
spec-ing that outside, it would be great.

I know how to quick-fix both of these, but I think this probably needs a 
solid fix from those of you who have been making the wonderful job of 
componentizing opensim, rather than a quick fix from me.

</I>&gt;<i> a patch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; set of this size can go stale quite quickly so hopefully a few of 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; other core devs can chime in real soon and give it a nod... and 
</I>&gt;<i> then we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; can work together to commit it. :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think this situation was somewhat unusual with the libOMV update 
</I>&gt;<i> - the names of fairly fundamental classes do not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; change every day.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think with a large patch the submitter has to accept a certain 
</I>&gt;<i> amount of pain in resyncing it to the current trunk -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this in itself demonstrates how serious they (and we) are about 
</I>&gt;<i> supporting it. There is a need, I feel, to consider
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this carefully and not rush in to a decision. This patch requires 
</I>&gt;<i> evaluation on both a raw technical and an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; architectural level - an evaluation that I hope to start helping 
</I>&gt;<i> with later on today.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm +1 for the idea, I'll defer to Justin's judgement on implementation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here because I won't have enough time to dig through this of late.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I definitely think getting hypergrid, or something like it, into core is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a good thing. Letting opensim grids interconnect out of the box is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something that has always been on our vision list.
