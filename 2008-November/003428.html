<PRE>People, I guess we need to clarify this policy on the grid page, as that only states &quot;Grid List Policy: Please only list your grid is your software is based on OpenSimulator.org SVN software code&quot; which obviously is too vague. How many of the grids on that page would you say are &quot;contributing back&quot;? and what is &quot;some time&quot;? could you define &quot;pure opensimulator grid&quot;? How far from trunk shall we deviate before we're not &quot;pure&quot;? Tribal Media has Tribal Server, our own branded version of OpenSim, just like 3Di has its. Ours are retail products that are not completely open source. But it sure is OpenSim. I have no idea what's going on with OLG, so could you please guide me to the post where they state that &quot;they have officially forked and are no longer using, or supporting, OpenSim&quot;.Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A>

That is weird they (OpenLife) are using RealXtend which is OpenSim at thecore and I see Steve/Sakai talking in this thread and contributing. Seemslike OpenLife is as much a part of the community as the rest. Am I missingsomething or don't they deserve to be a listed grid as well?

Hi,the reason was that they have officially forked and are no longerusing, or supporting, OpenSim.MelanieTodd Adams wrote:&gt; What was the justification for dropping OpenLifeGrid from the list ofgrids&gt; at Opensimulator.org?  They make significant contribution to the opensim&gt; effort and are extremely successful.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev_______________________________________________Opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev_______________________________________________Opensim-dev</A> mailing <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">listOpensim-dev at lists.berlios.dehttps</A>://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev
