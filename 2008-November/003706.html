<PRE>Dear Jhurliman:

Thank you for collaborating with me a little bit while I work through some Linux on PPC details.

First of all, a uname -a does say ppc64 on this Mac G5 with Fedora 9 installed, so I will assume it is 64bit. 

Next, I did download opensim-libs from the opensimulator.org svn and have a 'LibOMV_2362&quot; directory and did build its contents and do have a openjpeg-dotnet.dll which I copied to the opensim/bin working directory. When I invoke &quot;mono --debug OpenSim.exe&quot;, I can however see a System.DllNotFoundException on openjpeg-dotnet.dll, even though it came from the LibOMV_2362 compilation. The region does go through the normal startup and actually begins to start a logon, but we'll get to that in a minute.

I did try 'mono openjpeg-dotnet.dll' and mono tells me &quot;Cannot open assumbly openjpeg-dotnet.dll&quot;. It is readable and executable. I can do a 'mono Ode.NET.dll' and mono tells me &quot;Assembly Ode.NET.dll doesn't have an entry point&quot;, so I assume mono is setup up reasonably correctly.

Here is an attempt to logon to the region &quot;Mac Land&quot; which is connected to OSGrid with this Mac. Sorry about the long copy. This was done with &quot;export MONO_LOG_LEVEL=debug&quot; followed by &quot;mono --debug OpenSim.exe&quot; and the region was up to its normal console prompt with the associate openjpeg-dotnet.dll exception noted earlier.

Hopefully, this might trigger an idea that I can try next.

Thank you again for your support. Charles

Somewhere in the output of &#8220;uname -a&quot; you should be
able to tell if it&#8217;s a 32-bit or 64-bit Linux OS. If you paste the thread
spew into e-mail I can take a peek to see if it is something with
libopenjpeg-dotnet.dll or not. I recently found out that using OpenJPEG is *not*
threadsafe, and locking needs to happen in OpenJpeg.cs inside libomv. Watch for
an updated release soon.

Sorry,
JHurliman, that didnt quite come out the way I had intended.

I loaded Linux on a seperate partition of this Mac as that seemed the most
straightforward way to get it functioning as an OpenSim server. After this is
figured out, I can then extend the notions to the OS X partition by rebooting
the server.

So, this is an experiment to see how far our OpenSim notions can be extended.
It is certainly not a complaint of any sort. It just seemed this was a good
weekend to attempt to get some progress in the Mac and 64bit notions.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] OpenSim on Mac G5
Well, this
Mac G5 has had Fedora 9 Linux installed by me, so I dont think the dylib's
affect the situation.

I have been able to compile openjpeg-dotnet.dll from our svn and can get the
&quot;Mac Land&quot; region up and running on OSGrid. The issue currently is
that the region crashes with a mono thread spew when a login occurs. It looks
like mono threads are getting wrapped all around each other as the crash occurs
at different times in the login process.

For today, I am calling success at getting Linux installed, the source compiled
with mono/nant and the region inserting itself into the grid. Fedora 9 comes
with mono-1.9.1, which is just about the latest. 

I am a little puzzled as to whether the system is running as 32bit or 64bit in
Linux. Is there any way to tell? Although the install DVD iso image comes only
one way, I assume it is 64bit. 

So, some puzzles are solved and a few others are surfacing.

Charles

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] OpenSim on Mac G5
OSX uses .dylib
files for unmanaged (non-.NET)
code, not .dll or .so. I would say make sure you have
libopenjpeg-2.1.3.0-dotnet-1.dylib (or something like that) but the fact that
Mono is trying to access openjpeg-dotnet.dll means the DllMap seems to have
failed. Make sure you have OpenMetaverse.dll.config in that directory, and that
it contains a DllMap entry from openjpeg-dotnet.dll to the actual .dylib binary
in your bin/ directory.
 
On a side note,
I&#8217;ve been looking into a fully managed JPEG2000 codec. It&#8217;s quite a ways from
complete right now (and certainly slower than unmanaged code), but might prove
useful for certain specific tasks.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] OpenSim on Mac G5
 
To amplify a tiny bit, the exception says basically:

System.DllNotFoundException: openjpeg-dotnet.dll.

The issue right now seems to be that an &quot;ls open* -la&quot; shows this
file exists and is marked executable. So, I think there may be an underlying
.so that is non existent at this point.

$ ls open*.dll -la
-rwxrwxr-x 1 ckrinke ckrinke 196608 2008-11-23 11:03 openjpeg-dotnet.dll
[

On a functioning x86 server, I can see libopenjpeg-1.0.0.so and other files that are not on this
Mac G5 in our opensim/bin/ directory. I did try copying the the files from
/usr/lib that appear to be concerned with jpeg to our opensim/bin directory
like this:

$ cp /usr/lib/libjp*.so* .

And the region still has the same System.DllNotFoundException.

So, anyone that can shed a little light on this puzzle would help me get some
additional testing setup.

Charles

Subject: [Opensim-dev] OpenSim on Mac G5
I have a Mac G5 available for testing
for a little while and have installed Fedora 9 on it.

I can get OpenSim.exe compiled and the region up on OSGrid. There are a couple
of issues. One solved, one not solved.

ODE: Using our wiki, I was able to make ODE. I observe that we seem to need to
initialize ODE even when ODE is not specified in the OpenSim.ini file. We might
want to eliminate that dependency.

The region does come up, but has a jpeg exception which is at the end of this
email. At this point, I am a little puzzled with our various jpeg .so, .dll and
such that are in svn. Looks like we are supplying an x86 version binary from
svn.

In any case, a little help in getting past this jpeg exception would let me get
to where we can test a bit more on a 64bit Mac G5.
