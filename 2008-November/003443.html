Subject: [Opensim-dev] Automated Bug Reporting
 
The subject has been raised recently, in anticipation of the 0.6.0 release
about including an automated bug report process in OpenSim, obviously it
would be switched off by default, but the option would exist to have
exceptions logged in OpenSim reported to the Mantis bug tracker
automatically.
 
The big advantage to doing so is it becomes easier to prioritise which bugs
need to be fixed &#8211; issues which occur frequently would immediately become
visible (whereas right now they aren&#8217;t so much). It would also allow us to
get some debug feedback on features we implement &#8211; ie internal exceptions
which we ignore right now could be dumped onto the mantis with appropriate
tags.
 
The solution I am considering for implementing this is the MantisConnect
.NET adapter which basically uses the mantis SOAP interface &#8211; right now
we&#8217;ve got a section of code in the main OpenSim.exe which handles the &#8216;last
exception&#8217; &#8211; I&#8217;d like to put the code initially in there, then open the
option up for developers to report bugs via a &#8216;Util&#8217; member function at a
later point.
 
In terms of Mantis itself, I&#8217;m thinking it might be best to setup a second
project for the automated reports &#8211; while we lose the ability to then link
issues as &#8216;related&#8217; with a manual report, it also avoids cluttering up the
project with thousands of automated reports.
 
Thoughts?
