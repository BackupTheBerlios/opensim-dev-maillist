As much as I share that sentiment, and despite not having looked at the patch, it's usually a good idea to consider splitting large patches up into more of babysteps - 'process' over 'product' so to speak.
 
Ie, is it possible for the hypergrid posse to work with core over time to gradually change core into something suitable for them?
 
Most oftenly to let the code transform in steps leads to the code itself 'accumulating wisdom' - which leads to greated flexibility and encapsulation. (If it's done with proper love and care in each step) - and also lets core + hypergrid communicate over small chunks of code, instead of big whoppers. (Historically, big whoppers either rot or create havoc, but undesired outcomes)Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A> &gt; Date: Tue, 18 Nov 2008 08:08:32 -0500&gt; From: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">sdague at gmail.com</A>&gt; To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Hypergrid patch&gt; &gt; Justin Clark-Casey wrote:&gt; &gt; Dahlia Trimble wrote:&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks, that one built properly against 7364, but 7376 (head at the time &gt; &gt;&gt; I tried) complained about some missing references to LLSD. Seems a patch &gt; &gt;&gt; set of this size can go stale quite quickly so hopefully a few of the &gt; &gt;&gt; other core devs can chime in real soon and give it a nod... and then we &gt; &gt;&gt; can work together to commit it. :)&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this situation was somewhat unusual with the libOMV update - the names of fairly fundamental classes do not &gt; &gt; change every day.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think with a large patch the submitter has to accept a certain amount of pain in resyncing it to the current trunk - &gt; &gt; this in itself demonstrates how serious they (and we) are about supporting it. There is a need, I feel, to consider &gt; &gt; this carefully and not rush in to a decision. This patch requires evaluation on both a raw technical and an &gt; &gt; architectural level - an evaluation that I hope to start helping with later on today.&gt; &gt; I'm +1 for the idea, I'll defer to Justin's judgement on implementation&gt; here because I won't have enough time to dig through this of late.&gt; &gt; I definitely think getting hypergrid, or something like it, into core is&gt; a good thing. Letting opensim grids interconnect out of the box is&gt; something that has always been on our vision list.&gt; &gt; -Sean&gt; &gt; -- &gt; Sean Dague / Neas Bade&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">sdague at gmail.com</A>&gt; <A HREF="http://dague.net">http://dague.net</A>&gt; &gt;
