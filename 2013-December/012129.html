<PRE>After a brief hiatus recovering from a crashed disk and installing and
becoming accustomed with Windows 8.1 (question to MS: what the heck were
you thinking???), I&#8217;ve spent more time on the OpenSimulator varregion code.

The code is still on the &#8216;varregion&#8217; branch of the source repository and it
has been kept pretty close to the &#8216;master&#8217; branch. I&#8217;ve added the size
information to a bunch of the teleport messages trying to get teleport to a
large region working. Sadly, it crashes Singularity whenever you log into
or teleport to a non-legacy sized region in grid mode. Works in standalone
mode. I haven&#8217;t tested it yet, but I&#8217;m hoping adjacent standalone large
regions (like four 512&#215;512) now border cross. It is an iffy thing, though,
since there is &#8216;find my neighbor&#8217; logic in Scene, GridService,
EntityTransferModule, and a few other places. That logic does need some
cleaning up.

I found that the Singularity crash when running in grid mode has to do with
the fact that the grids out there are not running the &#8216;varregion&#8217; code. In
particular, OSGrid&#8217;s grid service is not storing and returning the region
size. This means that Singularity gets told the destination region is zero
by zero which is assumes means that region is legacy sized (256&#215;256). The
simulator, though, thinks the region is larger and sends terrain patches to
Singularity for the larger region. Singularity doesn&#8217;t like that and it
crashes complaining about bad terrain patches.

The fix is to get the grid services updated. To that end, I added a new
commit to &#8216;master&#8217; that adds the size accounting to RegionInfo, RegionData,
and GridRegion classes. Since the database code already knows about storing
the region sizes, this makes for a downward compatible update to the
&#8216;master&#8217; branch that does not change any APIs or change any functionality
except for passing around and storing the region size along with its
location.

Once that patch is distributed or cherry-picked
(commit 6869633d76b2a6664743a608e4284b8dd7df85a6), testing will continue.
