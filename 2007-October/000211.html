<PRE>I'm with Michael on this one; even though it's only one call, it's one HELL of a nested call.

I'm certainly against us writing our own xml-rpc handler code, even just for that one login method. I know libsl went down  that route, and used the .net xml features to do there own handler and I don't think it worked out well. So I'm against rewriting the wheel.  And say that we stick with using a xml-rpc library.Sean Dague &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">sean at dague.net</A>&gt; wrote:

Thoughthats a bunch of months off.&gt; I think that including an external library for the sake this single method&gt; is overkill, inclusion of the library will - however slightly - increase the&gt; load of work we have to do on the build system, and will be one more&gt; component which potentially can fail to built correctly.&gt; &gt; If I am correct in my belief that we will only need to use XML-RPC in that&gt; single place, I suggest we get rid of any external libs, which is dedicated&gt; to that goal.I'm not sure that I understand the option here. Are you proposing towrite your own XML-RPC implementation for login? XML-RPC is managedcode right, is there any reason that isn't intrinsically cross platformalready (or did I miss that part)?-Sean-- __________________________________________________________________Sean Dague Mid-Hudson Valleysean at dague dot net Linux Users <A HREF="Grouphttp://dague.net">Grouphttp://dague.net</A> <A HREF="http://mhvlug.orgThere">http://mhvlug.orgThere</A> is no silver bullet.
