<PRE>Dear Sean:

If you want to do this on osgrid. I would suspect that &quot;Sang&quot; is the stablest sim. It has no neighbors, is running basicphysics and has not crashed once.

I will try to attend the noon, tuesday, just let us know where.

Charles

Subject: [Opensim-dev] In World Office Hours Redux (was Re: How to contribute to OpenSim?)

Previously I had posted the idea of doing some in world office hours of
our own to start getting a bit more organized.  I'd like to bring up
that proposal again.  The near term goal should be banging out a pretty
extensive todo list on the wiki to help all of us figure out what the
next right pieces of code are to work on.

Based on the previous posts of people's availability I'm going to
suggest:

15:00 EDT (US Eastern Standard Time) which is 19:00 UTC (back track to
your timezone here: <A HREF="http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/tzc.tzc">http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/tzc.tzc</A> on
Tuesday, Oct 9th, for a kickoff of this.  It will be in world on an
OpenSim Sim (probably something on osgrid), but details on location can
be figured out once we know we've got a time worked out.

This should be after work for all the .eu folks, and noon for the west
coasters (so hopefully they can attend on their lunch break).  Please
respond back about availability for this.  It would be good to have as
many folks as possible there.

     -Sean

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
