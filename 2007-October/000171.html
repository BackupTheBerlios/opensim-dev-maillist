<PRE>I'd love to talk about $$ and IP, but it seems like we provide the plumbing,
not the water.  To what degree do we need to think about particular vendor's
services like Ebay micropayments?  Aren't we going to leave that up to the
grid operators?  If I have this right, then our job is simply to make the
thing extensible, and perhaps provide some simple back-end services as
samples to get people started.

Or am I missing something?

</I>&gt;<i> I know that maybe I am getting ahead of my self, but I think we need to

</I>&gt;<i> that. 
</I>&gt;<i> In a few months we will be ready for people to start providing content to 
</I>&gt;<i> grids.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then the question on who has rights to the stuff starts to emerge, for 
</I>&gt;<i> osgrid, matters are pretty simple, but what about all the other grids?
</I>&gt;<i> will 
</I>&gt;<i> they have the same policy as osgrid, or will they lean more towards LL?,
</I>&gt;<i> if 
</I>&gt;<i> they lean towards LL, how will ownership be transferred, how can money 
</I>&gt;<i> exchange hands?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We could leave this issue hidden in the closet, so another question is: 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Should we try to address this issue?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I think that we would be better of content wise, if content 
</I>&gt;<i> creators could have monetary gain from creating content, just like LL. On 
</I>&gt;<i> the otherhand, I strongly believe that the business model where a content 
</I>&gt;<i> creator makes an original, and then makes a living, from selling a copy of
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the original, is dead in this digital age. (Yes, this is the same problem,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the record industry, the software industry, and a lot of others are
</I>&gt;<i> facing)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some people are going to object to an open source grid, based on fear of 
</I>&gt;<i> having their creation. To my knowledge the only type of content which will
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> have an increased risk of being exposed are scripts, other than that, I 
</I>&gt;<i> think everything else can be ripped today; my guess is that people will be
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> more worried, and that we need to have our arguments in place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me try to outline some of the arguments I can see:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Yes, there is an increased risk of content being ripped, but that 
</I>&gt;<i> increase is &quot;only&quot; related to scripts
</I>&gt;<i> 2) A service/subcription model, where you customers buys a service, rather
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> than content will have no problems with content being ripped
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then the next question comes up, what kind of money to support? and how to
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> make that money trustworthy? LL currently has an - apparently - well
</I>&gt;<i> running 
</I>&gt;<i> system for handling micropayments called L$. I doubt we can tap into that,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but paypal has a similar system, albeit with some limitations:
