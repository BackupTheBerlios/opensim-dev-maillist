<PRE>I'm trying to get a handle on the 3rd party lib situation, both native and
managed.

Firstly, can anyone tell me what these dll's do, and whether they are being
used anymore?

 10/17/2007  01:58 AM            24,576 DotSets.dll
 10/17/2007  01:58 AM            40,960 Kds.Serialization.dll
 10/17/2007  01:58 AM           221,184 libdb_dotNET43.dll
 10/17/2007  01:58 AM           270,336 log4net.dll
 10/17/2007  01:58 AM           131,072 Mono.PEToolkit.dll

Secondly, I would like to locate the appropriate source code and licenses
for all of the following, or information as to why the source code is not
available (for instance I recall the Physx wrappers require you to sign some
SDK license or something like that).  Please mention anything you know about
versions, who compiled on what machine, if the assemblies were downloaded
from somewhere precompiled, whether they are written in C# or something
else, etc.  Basically whatever you know about any of these files (including
&quot;hey stupid, it's in the wiki!&quot;):

10/17/2007  01:47 AM            69,632 Axiom.MathLib.dll
10/17/2007  01:47 AM           110,592 CookComputing.XmlRpcV2.dll
10/17/2007  01:47 AM           593,408 Db4objects.Db4o.dll
10/17/2007  01:58 AM            52,224 Mono.Data.SqliteClient.dll
10/17/2007  01:47 AM            36,864 MonoXnaCompactMaths.dll
10/17/2007  01:47 AM           266,240 MySql.Data.dll
10/17/2007  01:47 AM            69,632 Nini.dll
10/17/2007  01:47 AM            57,344 PhysX-wrapper.dll
10/17/2007  01:47 AM             8,704 PhysX_Wrapper_Dotnet.dll
10/17/2007  01:47 AM           200,704 RAIL.dll
10/17/2007  01:47 AM           363,609 sqlite3.dll
10/17/2007  01:47 AM           568,832 System.Data.SQLite.dll
10/17/2007  01:47 AM            40,960 XMLRPC.dll

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding things, and it's understood that there will be
3rd party components without source or with licensing issues that preclude
us providing that source code.  However it seems in that case we should make
that clear, and we might want to consider whether items such as
PhysX_Wrapper.dll should be shipped in the /bin folder of the main trunk as
they are now.  In any case, there should be a wiki page or README or
something explaining where all this stuff comes from.
