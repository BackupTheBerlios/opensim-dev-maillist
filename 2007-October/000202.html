<PRE>danx0r,
 
thank you for taking this initiative. I'll give you what little information I have.
 
By the way; we should never have a problem with managed dll's as long as they are compiled for 'Any CPU', should we? 
 
&gt;<i> 10/17/2007 01:58 AM 270,336 log4net.dll
</I>This is not used (afaik) but quite a lot of people wants it into the core. There's aparently a patch that would include it.
 
&gt;<i> 10/17/2007 01:47 AM 69,632 Axiom.MathLib.dll
</I>This is a part of the Axiom 3D Engine library:
<A HREF="http://axiomengine.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">http://axiomengine.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</A>
 
Unfortunately, the MathLib sub-project is no longer available as a standalone dll but has been merged into the 'mother project'; It's easy enough to just create proj/build for just that dir though.
 
<A HREF="http://axiomengine.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/axiomengine/trunk/Projects/Axiom/Source/Engine/Math/">http://axiomengine.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/axiomengine/trunk/Projects/Axiom/Source/Engine/Math/</A>
 
We're just using it for 3D vector types and transformations, so we would really want to find something standalone that can replace both Axion and LibSL 3D types (right now we're casting back and forth between them)
 
&gt;<i> 10/17/2007 01:47 AM 110,592 CookComputing.XmlRpcV2.dll
</I> 
This is not used at the moment either, but is a way better implementation than the current XMLRPC so we thought we would use that instead; yet another good intention that never got implemented.
 
<A HREF="http://www.xml-rpc.net/">http://www.xml-rpc.net/</A>
&gt;<i> 10/17/2007 01:47 AM 593,408 Db4objects.Db4o.dll
</I>This is on its way out, to be replaced with SQLite - what's the status here?
 
&gt;<i> 10/17/2007 01:47 AM 40,960 XMLRPC.dll
</I>Used, afaik, only in login_to_simulator in the region, and (unfortunately) for grid communication.
 
It's a part of LibSL that has been moved from LibSL core into a side project (because apparently, it's leaky and sucks) - it also has no separate project this days, but is a part of the SLProxy:
 
<A HREF="http://openmetaverse.org:8180/source/xref/libsl/trunk/SLProxy/XmlRpcCS/">http://openmetaverse.org:8180/source/xref/libsl/trunk/SLProxy/XmlRpcCS/</A>
&gt;<i> Perhaps I'm misunderstanding things, and it's understood that there will be&gt; 3rd party components without source or with licensing issues that preclude&gt; us providing that source code. However it seems in that case we should make&gt; that clear, and we might want to consider whether items such as&gt; PhysX_Wrapper.dll should be shipped in the /bin folder of the main trunk as&gt; they are now. In any case, there should be a wiki page or README or&gt; something explaining where all this stuff comes from.
</I>Why we have everything in /bin is because I had issues with prebuild not being able to put dlls in a specified directory and then reference them properly, so combined with the issue of finding plug-in modules, everything got jumbled into /bin.
 
But maybe the time has come to bite the bullet and create /lib and /modules (and /config I guess) and delete /bin from the repository. If somebody would step up to do it, I'd be happy to assist.
 
Wiki is a great place for this information; that would be great documentation!
 
/Stefan
