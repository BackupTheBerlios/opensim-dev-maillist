I don't have much time right now, so this will be quick (and will try to write a longer reply later).

But yeah I think there is a lot of confusion about the UserAgent thing in the user server. I know I got a bit confused about that just last week. It seems that the UserAgent in there is really more of a UserSession, ie a new UserAgent is created every time the user logs in. 

I'm not sure why they would have different UUIDs, didn't actually look at that (but thought they where the same). 

One thing that we have repeatedly said is that we need to rewrite all the backend servers (ie user server etc) as the current ones are the result of very early work, from before we really knew how a lot of things worked or would work. One of the goals of 0.5 is meant to be that rewrite of the servers and the protocol between them and the regions.

I am a little mystified about the users table and the agents table.

I am afraid this boils down to definitions of:

What is a user?, What is an agent? and what is an avatar?, well mostly the 
difference between a user and an agent.

In the SQLite implementation both tables are maintained, in the MySQL 
implementation, only the user table is maintained.

According to the defintions of user vs agent in UserProfileData.cs the UUID 
of UserAgentData is not the same as the UUID of UserProfileData, but if this 
is so, how do you relate an agent to a user? the SQLite implementation, 
violates the comment made in the cs code, and assigns the same value to both 
UUID of agents and users.


who on earth, has decided that the datatype (UUID) is a propper name for a 
column in a database or a property on a class? UserID of type UUID, and 
AgentID of type UUID would be more fitting, or perhaps just ID of type UUID 
(depending on temperament)


So I guess my primary question regarding agents and users is?
What is the difference? and do we need to distinguish between the two?

now on to regions..
First some definitions.
a regionhandle, identifies a region based on it's x,y position in the grid, 
which is combined into one integer value.
a regionid, identifies a region based on a UUID.

Regions have the regionid as the primary key, in both SQLite and MySQL. In 
the agents table we store both the handle and the id , in the users table we 
store the handle but not the id.

This gives rise to the question.. &quot;Is the users home&quot; tied to the handle or 
the id. What is really the primary id of a region, the handle or the id?
