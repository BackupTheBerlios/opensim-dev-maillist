<PRE>I appreciate this vote Sean, mostly as *all* the testing that I have done to date as been with mono-1.2.4, as installed by the mondo-mono-binary installer on my FC6 systems back in May or June.

When we are ready to consider mono-1.2.5, some lead time to change the test systems would be helpful, but for now, I will assume we continue business as usual with mono-1.2.4.

If the memory leak is really a 1.2.3 issue (I think that's still up in
the air) then it fixes itself eventually as people move to 1.2.4.  Gutsy
is out this month.  OpenSim is pushing some envelopes here, so asking
people to move to Gutsy once it is out.

I've been saying we need to support whatever is in latest Ubuntu stable
as a minimum, and I'll keep saying that.  So 1.2.4 will be our near term
requirment, not 1.2.5.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
