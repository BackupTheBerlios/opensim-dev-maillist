<PRE>&gt;<i> Let me try to come up with a few definitions of terms, which doesn't require &gt; a lot of refactoring:
</I>Add them to the wiki for further elaboration and discussion
 &gt; Sim/Simulator: a program which runs a simulation of objects interacting, &gt; possibly with the involvement of simulated physics.&gt; &gt; Region: a 256x256 wide area, having a terrain and a number of objects, &gt; interacting
A region has an (x/y) position in a grid, and a regionhandle.
A region can also be defined as an IP Endpoint that the Viewer can establish a client connection to.
I wouldn't emphasis the 256x256 too much, as this is something some of us are looking into tweaking.
&gt;<i> A Sim can house multiple regions, and each region can house multiple objects
</I>Actually, it is the Scene that hosts objects, the Region is a communications layer koncept.
 
At the time, we've been keeping things simple by having one region &lt;-&gt; one scene but that is sure to change.
 &gt; An object can either be a collection of prims or an avatar
I guess the term we're using is 'Entity' which is subclassed into ScenePresences and SceneObjectGroups (that has SceneObjectParts)
 
A ScenePresence can have an Avatar (if it's the root)
&gt;<i> User: This represents a person in the real world, somthing which has an &gt; email, a username etc.&gt; &gt; Viewer: an application which is used to view the state of the simulation. &gt; Currently I know of three, the LL viewer, the OpenSL test client and &gt; AjaxLife&gt; &gt; Agent: in a way, this can be thought of as a cursor, indicating what &gt; position inside the simulator, the viewer is observing from., typically a &gt; viewer will have multiple agents, a primary, often backed by an avatar, and &gt; multiple child agents, in the neighboring regions.
</I>An agent has a x/y position within the region; a 'root agent' is in the current region, and the viewer has 'child agents' that listens for changes in neighbouring sims.
&gt;<i> Session: Each connection between a viewer and an agent, regardless if the &gt; agent is the primary or one of the child agents. Personally I would prefer &gt; that we named child agents as sub-agents, and the sessions between the &gt; viewer and sub-agents as sub-sessions.
</I>Wouldn't that be each (authenticated?) connection between an client and a region?
 
An unauthenticated connection is called a 'Circuit'.
 
What is a 'sub' that a 'child' is not?
 &gt; Unless somebody strongly objects to this convetion, I will start using that &gt; naming convention in my codewriting.&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing that we have repeatedly said is that we need to rewrite all the &gt; &gt; backend servers (ie user server etc) as the current ones are the result of &gt; &gt; very early work, from before we really knew how a lot of things worked or &gt; &gt; would work. One of the goals of 0.5 is meant to be that rewrite of the &gt; &gt; servers and the protocol between them and the regions.&gt; &gt; won't that hurt the goal of &quot;frequent releases&quot; ?
Baby steps, not rewrites.
