</I>
I agree for paramaters that are strongly related to the task of a certain piece of code.
If you need to know about some parameters to understand it's working -- pass it as a parameter.
I even agree to the point that a piece of code should reasonable work, if no ini-file is present.

If it's about some other settings (like e.g. which path to write files to, that are only used to debug the code, and no, this is no logging output)
or other parameters like some that influence the internal accuracy, I don't agree.
1. There might be a hole lot of these settings.
2. Thinking about a layered architecture that allows modules to be plugged and exchanged, there might be parameters that are different for each implementation. How to pass those through parameters once the interface is stable?

So I stick with the ini-file approach here. The only question is, how to do it best?

All your points are good and valid. We need to get our config and directory shit together.
 
We're trying to move to Nini configuration library for configuration settings.
 
Nini is an excellent framework for combining different types of settings, and supports cascading and defaults. I think you will find it gives you what you're asking for.

what about a common class that reads the same config file that each component can instantiate? similar to the proposal for logging.
 
personally, i'd like to see the following objectives for config:
* single file OR single directory for all configuration information
    - single directory assumes consistent file naming conventions and common syntax across the files (to the extent its possible)
* consistent method for overriding config through command line options
* ability to set all paths through the config files (move a bunch of the immediate strings into config vars)
    - eg location of the asset/library initialization files, region/estate settings file names, default terrain
 
right now configuration includes multiple formats (xml for regions &amp; estatesettings &amp; asset/library initialization, ini format for high level sim config), multiple directories (off bin including regions, script engines, terrain filters, etc), multiple naming conventions, etc. and most of this is embedded in immediate strings inside the code.

We try to follow a layering approach, and an 'tell don't ask' approach, which would mean that the application pulls out the settings and feed them to your code, typically thru constructor initialization. Code acessing global singletons tend to get tangly and difficult to follow./Stefan
