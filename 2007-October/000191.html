<PRE>Read the thread 'a modest proposal' in the archives for more info about agents and regions - and please add that info to the wiki.

I know I got a bit confused about that just last week. It &gt; &gt; seems that the UserAgent in there is really more of a UserSession, ie a &gt; &gt; new UserAgent is created every time the user logs in.&gt; &gt; Let me try to come up with a few definitions of terms, which doesn't require &gt; a lot of refactoring:&gt; &gt; Sim/Simulator: a program which runs a simulation of objects interacting, &gt; possibly with the involvement of simulated physics.&gt; &gt; Region: a 256x256 wide area, having a terrain and a number of objects, &gt; interacting&gt; &gt; A Sim can house multiple regions, and each region can house multiple objects&gt; &gt; An object can either be a collection of prims or an avatar&gt; &gt; User: This represents a person in the real world, somthing which has an &gt; email, a username etc.&gt; &gt; Viewer: an application which is used to view the state of the simulation. &gt; Currently I know of three, the LL viewer, the OpenSL test client and &gt; AjaxLife&gt; &gt; Agent: in a way, this can be thought of as a cursor, indicating what &gt; position inside the simulator, the viewer is observing from., typically a &gt; viewer will have multiple agents, a primary, often backed by an avatar, and &gt; multiple child agents, in the neighboring regions.&gt; &gt; Session: Each connection between a viewer and an agent, regardless if the &gt; agent is the primary or one of the child agents. Personally I would prefer &gt; that we named child agents as sub-agents, and the sessions between the &gt; viewer and sub-agents as sub-sessions.&gt; &gt; Unless somebody strongly objects to this convetion, I will start using that &gt; naming convention in my codewriting.&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing that we have repeatedly said is that we need to rewrite all the &gt; &gt; backend servers (ie user server etc) as the current ones are the result of &gt; &gt; very early work, from before we really knew how a lot of things worked or &gt; &gt; would work. One of the goals of 0.5 is meant to be that rewrite of the &gt; &gt; servers and the protocol between them and the regions.&gt; &gt; won't that hurt the goal of &quot;frequent releases&quot; ?&gt; /tleiades&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
