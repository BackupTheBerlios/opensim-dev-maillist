yeah as far as I know, both xml-rpc libraries are managed libraries (ie .net dlls), so see no problem with using one of them. I'm certainly against us writing our own xml-rpc handler code, even just for that one login method. I know libsl went down  that route, and used the .net xml features to do there own handler and I don't think it worked out well. 

So I'm against rewriting the wheel.  And say that we stick with using a xml-rpc library.

Hopefully, that too will become REST based on the AWG work.  Though
thats a bunch of months off.

I'm not sure that I understand the option here.  Are you proposing to
write your own XML-RPC implementation for login?  XML-RPC is managed
code right, is there any reason that isn't intrinsically cross platform
already (or did I miss that part)?

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
