&gt;<i> Nearly everyone working on opensim has there own ideas of what they want from the project. But I'm certainly in the camp of thinking that the goal of it isn't to create a SL clone as such. I want to create a 3d world server, it just happens that we are compatible with the SL viewer/client.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With opensim being a open source project, and with the current architecture of how things work (in the SL protocol) it is very hard to make assets secure. Even on a closed system like SL, there are so many problems with trying to stop people copying other people's work. So I think most of us think of it like webpages. Anyone can copy the source of a website or a picture from a website. But it doesn't stop people from making a living, by creating websites.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course a goal for most people is to be able to connect opensim regions to the SL grid network at some point in the future. And maybe as LL work towards opening up their grid network, there might be changes that could possible help to make assets more secure (but I wouldn't count on it).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So basically, I don't really think trying to come up with some way of stopping people copying assets is even worth much time; at least at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On to money. I think with the current architecture/protocol, the problems of trying to do some sort of money system is even worse. With the current system, you would have to trust the opensim server that you were connected to. So if someone was going to use the current system, I think it would be up to the grid owner to add a system to handle it( and to get people to trust that grid). I really don't see that as part of the opensim project (although there are others who do).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing related to money is that I believe as part of LL's plans for opening up their grid, that they are going to be changing to a Client based system (ie the client connects to a separate secure payment transaction server) so that the region server doesn't get involved with the handling of the transaction (it is just informed that the transaction has been completed). Or something like that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But anyway, I think if anyone is going to work on these things based on the current architecture, then really they should be as some kind of module and really be outside of the core of opensim. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess this comes down to my view as not really seeing opensim as a SL clone. So if someone wants to make a SL clone from it, with money transactions and &quot;secure&quot; assets, then they should be addons. As I don't think every system running opensim servers are going to have the same needs. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see opensim more as the core being a 3d world server, and people use
</I>&gt;<i> it to create whatever system they want. Just don't expect it to always
</I>&gt;<i> fit all your needs out of the box.
</I>
+1 on all of this.  Anyone that is really interested in in world
economies is welcome to show up and bring code, but I think a lot of us
think there are a lot of interesting places for OpenSim to be used that
aren't just SL clones.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
