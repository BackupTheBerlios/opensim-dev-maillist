<PRE>Hi

I think it would be great if we could find a strategy for handling external 
libs, I don't have any preferences if this is a separate project called 
OpenSim-libs, or a project integrated into OpenSim. I you feel that Scons is 
the tool of choice, then by all means use it.

My only concern is that OpenSim should compile under windows, and support 
for x64 would be even better. I am one of the people who are weary of 
Cygwin. In my book, Cygwin is an operating system I install on top of 
windows, if I wanted to use a Unix like operating system, I would have 
chosen Linux as my primary operating system, and not a quasi operating 
system, installed on top of windows.

I am sorry if this rattles some Linux people, it is not my intention, not by 
a long shot. I think that Linux is a great operating system; hey some of my 
machines do run Linux, but windows is good at some things, and Linux is good 
at other things, there is even some areas of overlap, where the two OS'es 
are equaly good. I feel it is important that we support both, preferably Mac 
as well.

Support to me, means support for the *native* environment, i.e. we should 
not require wine for linux or cygwin for windows. In other words:

We support Linux, period, (maybe we have to consider what distro's we 
support)
We support Windows, period. (maybe we have to consider what versions we 
support)
