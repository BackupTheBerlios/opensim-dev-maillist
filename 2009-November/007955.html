<PRE>I Agree with separating the documentation for each release. My biggest
issue was trying to fix the &quot;bugs&quot; specified on the how to in the
version I downloaded and the bug didn't even exist in that version.
The mixture of ROBUST in with documentation on the old method is very
confusing. I actually decided to stop messing with OpenSim until the
documentation was updated. I would only assume many people have
decided the same. While I like a challenge I really don't have the
time to sift through 1500 pages of blogs and figure out what does or
doesn't pertain to the specific version I am trying to compile. I
would be willing to help verify the documentation on a few different
installs and help suggest any changes that need to be made. I don't
mind installing virtual machines of any os we want to provide
tutorials for. Doing something like this would also allow us to
provide instructions from a fresh install so we can make sure we know
everything that is needed to install OpenSim properly. I know it would
be insane to try and provide step by steps for every variation of
linux but maybe a few? the main documentation for compiling OpenSim
wouldn't include all these variations but maybe links to sub pages
with specific ways to make sure you have all the dependencies. The
main walk through should flow well though with links to sub pages
giving more detail for specific distributions/platforms for that
section. I think that this type of method would only really need to be
repeated during the compile/build process. Setting up the
configuration and launching would only be slightly different.  Maybe
this is getting too complicated to talk about in an email but I would
love to help figure out the best way to structure the documentation. I
know that the more specific you get the more work its going to be but
I consider the documentation for a product to be what makes it
successful.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Kyle said, so kindly, it is far more fruitful if we work together, but as
</I>&gt;<i> others have said - a willingness to help without knowing just where or how
</I>&gt;<i> to begin is just as fruitless as no help at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would love to have the opportunity to collaborate on a way to develop a
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward and simplistic compile-install-administer wiki that we can
</I>&gt;<i> all work on, tweak, proof, rearrange, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a brief background, I have years of past experience in basic programming,
</I>&gt;<i> html/css web design and current very thorough understanding of
</I>&gt;<i> MySQL/WordPress/MediaWiki/etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, last week I re-activated domain names I've owned for many years that
</I>&gt;<i> all route to the core domain www.lenfocenter.com - &quot;The Lenformation Center&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> - ha!, back when I was a bright eye'd graduate student I thought
</I>&gt;<i> Lenformation - all there was to know about me (Len) - was such a cool idea.
</I>&gt;<i> Currenty it just says &quot;coming soon.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been planning to use the domain more as a means of relaying specific
</I>&gt;<i> topics of interest to me, and hoped when re-activating the domain recently
</I>&gt;<i> that I'd further the development of the &quot;Portable OpenSim Platform&quot; I had
</I>&gt;<i> invested a lot of time in earlier this year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BUT, in agreement with others - if we can collaborate and converse, I would
</I>&gt;<i> be happy to offer anything I can with the resources I have, as I'm sure
</I>&gt;<i> others would too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And on the side, if there is a need for any additional temporary forums,
</I>&gt;<i> wiki's, etc - my domain is hosted on a very reliable and high-throughput
</I>&gt;<i> backbone and I have dedicated access to implement up to two high-use MySQL
</I>&gt;<i> databases.&#160; Again, should the need or desire arise, that is what I have to
</I>&gt;<i> offer by way of resources.&#160; I can also secure a domain for additional use at
</I>&gt;<i> any time (takes effect within 1 to 2 hours 24/7).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, my chief interest would be in documentation, writing
</I>&gt;<i> step-by-step procedures, and so forth.&#160; I'm also good with taking and
</I>&gt;<i> editing screen-shots and assembling step-wise procedures for following along
</I>&gt;<i> - that are print-ready.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to contact me via email and briefly familiarize me with any other
</I>&gt;<i> means of communication - IRC, IM, etc.&#160; I use Pigeon and have access to
</I>&gt;<i> Yahoo IM, MSN (Hotmail) IM, Google/gMail Chat, and ICQ, but could
</I>&gt;<i> accommodate another means if necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just let me know and I'll be ready to take part.
