<PRE>berlios.de's Pipermail seems to have a lot of trouble with Gmail posts (or
maybe Gmail's to blame :P).  It mangled a post of mine from yesterday,
turning 1 post into 7 entries in the Opensim web archive (despite people
receiving the post correctly by email), and now it's mangled my URL for The
Cathedral and the Bazaar.  He's the URL again as plain text, not a Gmail
link:


<A HREF="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/</A>

or

&gt;<i> The recent thread about &quot;Leaving Opensim&quot; highlights that not everyone has
</I>&gt;<i> yet absorbed the impact of recent changes in SCM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While it's true that the Opensim Core group still operates partly as a
</I>&gt;<i> Cathedral (because they anoint *people* to join them, instead of picking
</I>&gt;<i> code contributions on the merits of the code), the project's SCM moved from
</I>&gt;<i> SVN to Git a little while ago, and this brings about a profound change.
</I>&gt;<i> It's not merely a different SCM tool, but a change from centralized to
</I>&gt;<i> distributed code management, and this brings Opensim almost entirely into
</I>&gt;<i> the Bazaar model.  (Non-programmers may want to see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/&lt;http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/&lt;http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> if this is new.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With Git, everyone's repository for the project has equal standing, and
</I>&gt;<i> anyone can clone their own repository, make changes, and advertise their
</I>&gt;<i> improvements.  Approval by the Core team is not required, and nothing
</I>&gt;<i> important distinguishes Opensim Core's own repository from any other.  The
</I>&gt;<i> system is truly distributed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a result, there is no need for anyone to &quot;leave Opensim&quot; owing to
</I>&gt;<i> divergence of views or direction.  Just clone your own repo and let people
</I>&gt;<i> know about it.  If your contributions are useful, people will merge your
</I>&gt;<i> changes into their own clones of the Core repo, or will follow your branch,
</I>&gt;<i> or will clone your own repo wholesale.  It's like old-fashioned forking but
</I>&gt;<i> without the hassles of forking, and with much reduced chasing of tail
</I>&gt;<i> lights. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In time, I expect that the Opensim Core developer group will be replaced by
</I>&gt;<i> a Steering Group, perhaps once version 1.0 has been reached and a public
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim Foundation has been created.  The steering group could select and
</I>&gt;<i> test well-regarded public contributions from a large number of community
</I>&gt;<i> developer Git repositories, picked on the basis of consistency and community
</I>&gt;<i> needs.  Then the Bazaar will truly have arrived.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But we're almost there anyway, because the tools already allow it.  There
</I>&gt;<i> is no need to leave, just join the Git bazaar. :-)
