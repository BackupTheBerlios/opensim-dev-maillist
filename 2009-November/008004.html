<PRE>We need to do something new because of all the metadada associated  
with this kind of content, but we don't need to reinvent the wheel  
from scratch:

<A HREF="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/tar1.html">http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/tar1.html</A>

There's more options in tar than one would care to implement here, but  
they are certainly a good starting point. The main difference is that  
files don't have a whole lot of metadata, therefore tar is relatively  
light in terms of filters. But it does have the --exclude=PATTERN  
which is very rich.

</I>&gt;<i> A cool use case that comes to my mind immediately (but I don't know  
</I>&gt;<i> whether it's easy or not :-)) is
</I>&gt;<i> the relocation of airboxes. I remember having to relocate a 10000+  
</I>&gt;<i> prims airboxed city in SL,
</I>&gt;<i> and it was a real pita. Moving all objects manually was out question  
</I>&gt;<i> because it would have been
</I>&gt;<i> too time consuming, and mass-selecting 10000 prims is buggy, to say  
</I>&gt;<i> the least -- additionally,
</I>&gt;<i> the viewers are very stupid in that respect, because mass selection  
</I>&gt;<i> does not select Linden
</I>&gt;<i> plants and trees. I ended up by mass-selecting anyway, then manually  
</I>&gt;<i> moving up the
</I>&gt;<i> airboxed city (which caused of course incredible lag), and then a  
</I>&gt;<i> lot of smaller objects
</I>&gt;<i> had escaped the selection and had to be moved manually, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be great if the load/save oar pair would allow for the  
</I>&gt;<i> following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Saving everything in a sim between z1 and z2 meters (effectively  
</I>&gt;<i> storing one aixbox
</I>&gt;<i> level only), and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Load the previous oar with an offset of z3 (i.e., all objects  
</I>&gt;<i> would get their previous
</I>&gt;<i> z plus z3, which could be positive or negative).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I mentioned previously, I don't know if this falls under the  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;easy&quot; case category or not :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, once one starts to think in the direction of saving anything  
</I>&gt;<i> less than a whole
</I>&gt;<i> sim, the relocation problem appears immediately. What if I save a  
</I>&gt;<i> building in a partial
</I>&gt;<i> oar but I want to have it load-merged in a different position? Of  
</I>&gt;<i> course this can also
</I>&gt;<i> be done with linksets, but large linksets tend to be unmanageable --  
</I>&gt;<i> or with coalesced
</I>&gt;<i> objects, but the same problem applies, and besides they are not  
</I>&gt;<i> currently implemented
</I>&gt;<i> by Opensim. I think partial oars can fill a hole here, but at the  
</I>&gt;<i> price of implementing
</I>&gt;<i> relocation in the load-merge operation (and possibly some form of z- 
</I>&gt;<i> rotation too).
