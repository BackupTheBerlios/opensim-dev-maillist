<PRE>this is what we're thinking we're going to do in VWRAP.

we're going to define an authentication service that's run by the agent
domain. (for peeps new to VWRAP, a &quot;domain&quot; is a collection of network hosts
with the same &quot;administrative authority.&quot; the &quot;agent domain&quot; is a domain
that provides mostly &quot;agent related&quot; services, including the authentication
service.)

individual users will authenticate against this authentication service. then
some magic happens and the user's avatar is placed in a region in a region
domain.

the &quot;magic&quot; that happens after user authentication and before the user's
avatar gets placed is that the agent domain has to figure out the service
URL of the region to place the avatar, and that region has to figure out if
it trusts that agent domain.

so the current expectation is that we'll probably have a couple large agent
domains like secondlife, OSGrid, etc. and maybe even a few managed by large
companies for the benefit of their employees. once the user's client
application is authenticated to the agent domain, the client application may
request that the agent domain place the user's avatar in a region. (note!
with VWRAP, you can be authenticated to an agent domain for the purpose of
participating in group chat or inventory manipulation without being rezzed
in world.)

and here's where it gets mildly funky. the agent domain and the region
domain need to have _some_ level of trust with each other, or they have to
be explicit about the fact that they trust everyone. agent domain
authorities may not want to rez an avatar in an untrusted region. the
canonical example of this is second life not wanting to rez an avatar and
all it's attachments in the &quot;pirate bay&quot; region. some regions may not trust
all agent domains. consider a series of regions administered by IBM, for the
purpose of transacting IBM business. i'm not an IBM employee, but it seems
reasonable they would like to know who's rezzing in their regions, so they
may establish a policy of only allowing people with accounts on IBM's agent
domain to be able to rez in their region domain.

there are currently two proposals for managing this trust. the first
utilizes PKIX (which is a subset of X.509) to define semantics for
interpreting the subject name of client side certificates in transactions
carried over HTTPS. the other is the use of OAuth for one domain to
explicitly grant access to another domain's systems for a particular
purpose. both systems look like they're going to be fully specified, giving
deployers a choice as to which auth scheme they want to use.

&gt;<i> Ok, maybe it's a misunderstood. I will try to explain what I wanted to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine 100000 region servers pretending to be a grid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I understood from Morgaine comment:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Opensim needs decentralized / distributed mechanisms for *
</I>&gt;<i> identity,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * was
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I have entered that grid, my authentication was managed by one region
</I>&gt;<i> server. When I try to jump to another region in the same grid I have to
</I>&gt;<i> authenticate again in the region server and that region server must contain
</I>&gt;<i> my data to authenticate me again&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nowadays is like: Enter in a grid, being authenticated by a common user
</I>&gt;<i> server, when I want to jump to another region in the grid, I don't need to
</I>&gt;<i> authenticate me again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I understand with &quot;descentralized&quot; is: each opensim servers has the
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms to authenticate an user even when it is part of a grid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And that is what I don't understand: why? why not to surrogate the
</I>&gt;<i> authentications to specialized and centralized servers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And that was the reason for my question about OpenID, maybe this is a
</I>&gt;<i> system considered &quot;decentralized&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway I can't see anything bad on centralized servers. If anyone wants to
</I>&gt;<i> enter in my server he/she have to follow my rules; if I have 1000 servers, I
</I>&gt;<i> provide you with a common auth mechanism for accessing all of them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe I am completelly wrong.
