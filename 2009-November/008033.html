</I>&gt;<i> and accessed.  To put one in, an event needs to be added to the
</I>&gt;<i> IAssetService interface and each AssetCache implementation will need
</I>&gt;<i> an interlocked int to count how many gets and puts it currently has

</I>&gt;<i> will need an event handler..   which updates the values in
</I>&gt;<i> SimStatsReporter in Scene (StatsReporter).   This idea of external
</I>&gt;<i> access resource instrumentation should really have been built in to
</I>&gt;<i> the design of the AssetService.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This last recent load test, there were no real statistics that I could
</I>&gt;<i> use to determine what the limiting factor was.
</I>&gt;<i> Time Dilation was pegged at 1.0..    even when the simulator was
</I>&gt;<i> obviously struggling.    Total Frame time (MS) was -50ms even when the
</I>&gt;<i> simulation MS was 850ms and the Physics ms was 250ms, so the
</I>&gt;<i> inconsistencies made it impossible to know what part of the simulator
</I>&gt;<i> was struggling.  Agent Updates were erratic..   sometimes high..
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes low when the simulator was fine and when it was struggling.
</I>&gt;<i> Pending Uploads and Downloads were always 0, so there was no way to
</I>&gt;<i> know how well the simulator was downloading and uploading assets to
</I>&gt;<i> and from the grid.   Packet stats were non-existant, so there was no
</I>&gt;<i> way to know how well the UDP handlers were faring under the load.
</I>&gt;<i> When it crashed, it crashed with a mono based stack trace which
</I>&gt;<i> pointed to out of memory errors, so the only way that you could,
</I>&gt;<i> scientifically, find out what the issue is..   is to run a load test
</I>&gt;<i> under a memory profiler.     We know, that running a public load test
</I>&gt;<i> under a memory profiler is quite impractical.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To make something better, I need to know two things, where it is, and
</I>&gt;<i> where I want it to be.    How can we make OpenSimulator better if we
</I>&gt;<i> don't have statistics that point to where we are currently?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On that note, I propose that, when designing objects for functionality
</I>&gt;<i> in OpenSimulator, that we also consider if the objects should be
</I>&gt;<i> instrumented and, what would be the best way to go about instrumenting
</I>&gt;<i> the objects.  We should incorporate instrumentation into the design of
</I>&gt;<i> the objects.   Some of that instrumentation is appropriate for a
</I>&gt;<i> client to see, some of it might not be.   Consider that, many of them
</I>&gt;<i> should be client facing and be included in the SimStats that get sent
</I>&gt;<i> to the client..    so that we can have a reasonable idea of what's
</I>&gt;<i> going on with a simulator at a glance.   Also, in the design of the
</I>&gt;<i> instrumentation, we make sure that the instrumentation is accurate and
</I>&gt;<i> lightweight.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The load test went reasonably...      but, we didn't get half of the
</I>&gt;<i> information on the simulator that we needed to be able to improve it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please comment :)     I look forward to hearing your responses.

Instrumentation of internal components was what I was originally doing with the 
&quot;show stats&quot; command on the region console.  You'll see that it has fields for 
asset cache information, abnormal client thread terminations, etc.  Some of this 
data collection may have decayed because of a lack of unit tests... ;)

The framework itself is in OpenSim.Framework.Statistics.  Collection is done 
either by explicit push (i.e. the login service knows to call 
UserStatsCollector.AddSuccessfulLogin()) or by pull.

This was a pretty clumsy way of implementing it though, events might be a lot 
better (in my defense, I was fresh from Java at the time).

I'd really like to see a single instrumentation framework rather than the 3 (?) 
we now have.  I don't mind at all if the stuff in OpenSim.Framework.Statistics 
goes away as long as the functionality remains.

Of course, needless to say I'm +1 on the idea of instrumentation in general and 
trying to do a little bit of thinking about providing it up front when writing a 
component.
