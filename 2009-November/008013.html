</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hey there,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A while back, we had somewhat reasonable statistics being generated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and presented to the client.    They were not always accurate, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on what I saw, I could, pretty much pin certain parts of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simulator as the limiting factor during load tests.  I'd say, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number 1 reason that they were semi-accurate and not accurate..  in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the past..   is because nobody ever thought about instrumentation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> during the functionality design.     It was always 'tacked on later'.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  One example of this..    is the current AssetCache implementation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  There's no way, currently, to know, at a glance..   how many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> external requests it has open.   Additionally, it will be extremely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difficult to put one in because of the way the objects are designed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and accessed.  To put one in, an event needs to be added to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IAssetService interface and each AssetCache implementation will need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an interlocked int to count how many gets and puts it currently has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> open to the external data source as well as it's own event calling
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> schedule.   Then, the IAssetService property in Scene, (AssetService)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will need an event handler..   which updates the values in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SimStatsReporter in Scene (StatsReporter).   This idea of external
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> access resource instrumentation should really have been built in to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the design of the AssetService.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This last recent load test, there were no real statistics that I could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use to determine what the limiting factor was.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Time Dilation was pegged at 1.0..    even when the simulator was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obviously struggling.    Total Frame time (MS) was -50ms even when the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simulation MS was 850ms and the Physics ms was 250ms, so the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inconsistencies made it impossible to know what part of the simulator
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was struggling.  Agent Updates were erratic..   sometimes high..
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sometimes low when the simulator was fine and when it was struggling.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pending Uploads and Downloads were always 0, so there was no way to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know how well the simulator was downloading and uploading assets to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and from the grid.   Packet stats were non-existant, so there was no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way to know how well the UDP handlers were faring under the load.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When it crashed, it crashed with a mono based stack trace which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pointed to out of memory errors, so the only way that you could,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scientifically, find out what the issue is..   is to run a load test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> under a memory profiler.     We know, that running a public load test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> under a memory profiler is quite impractical.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To make something better, I need to know two things, where it is, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where I want it to be.    How can we make OpenSimulator better if we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't have statistics that point to where we are currently?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On that note, I propose that, when designing objects for functionality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in OpenSimulator, that we also consider if the objects should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instrumented and, what would be the best way to go about instrumenting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the objects.  We should incorporate instrumentation into the design of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the objects.   Some of that instrumentation is appropriate for a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client to see, some of it might not be.   Consider that, many of them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be client facing and be included in the SimStats that get sent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the client..    so that we can have a reasonable idea of what's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> going on with a simulator at a glance.   Also, in the design of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instrumentation, we make sure that the instrumentation is accurate and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lightweight.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The load test went reasonably...      but, we didn't get half of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information on the simulator that we needed to be able to improve it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please comment :)     I look forward to hearing your responses.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regards
