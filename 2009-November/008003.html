<PRE>I totally get the z1 to z2 approach.  I had a situation a while back where
I'd been doing a lot of experimental building up around 3,000 to 4,000
meters and had kind of forgotten about that stuff up there and focused on
some ground-level builds.  Well, when I made an OAR I thought it was a bit
big and then remembered the 5,000 or so prims I'd &quot;abandoned&quot; up above.  If
I could have just backed up a certain elevation section then I could have
backed up the stuff on the ground and left the other stuff up above out of
the backup.  Would make for a much cleaner and consistent restoration in a
new region later.

So definitely +1 to the idea of backing up based on Z coords, if that is at
all a possibility for future consideration...

&gt;<i> A cool use case that comes to my mind immediately (but I don't know whether
</I>&gt;<i> it's easy or not :-)) is
</I>&gt;<i> the relocation of airboxes. I remember having to relocate a 10000+ prims
</I>&gt;<i> airboxed city in SL,
</I>&gt;<i> and it was a real pita. Moving all objects manually was out question
</I>&gt;<i> because it would have been
</I>&gt;<i> too time consuming, and mass-selecting 10000 prims is buggy, to say the
</I>&gt;<i> least -- additionally,
</I>&gt;<i> the viewers are very stupid in that respect, because mass selection does
</I>&gt;<i> not select Linden
</I>&gt;<i> plants and trees. I ended up by mass-selecting anyway, then manually moving
</I>&gt;<i> up the
</I>&gt;<i> airboxed city (which caused of course incredible lag), and then a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> smaller objects
</I>&gt;<i> had escaped the selection and had to be moved manually, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be great if the load/save oar pair would allow for the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Saving everything in a sim between z1 and z2 meters (effectively storing
</I>&gt;<i> one aixbox
</I>&gt;<i> level only), and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Load the previous oar with an offset of z3 (i.e., all objects would get
</I>&gt;<i> their previous
</I>&gt;<i> z plus z3, which could be positive or negative).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I mentioned previously, I don't know if this falls under the &quot;easy&quot; case
</I>&gt;<i> category or not :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, once one starts to think in the direction of saving anything less
</I>&gt;<i> than a whole
</I>&gt;<i> sim, the relocation problem appears immediately. What if I save a building
</I>&gt;<i> in a partial
</I>&gt;<i> oar but I want to have it load-merged in a different position? Of course
</I>&gt;<i> this can also
</I>&gt;<i> be done with linksets, but large linksets tend to be unmanageable -- or
</I>&gt;<i> with coalesced
</I>&gt;<i> objects, but the same problem applies, and besides they are not currently
</I>&gt;<i> implemented
</I>&gt;<i> by Opensim. I think partial oars can fill a hole here, but at the price of
</I>&gt;<i> implementing
</I>&gt;<i> relocation in the load-merge operation (and possibly some form of
</I>&gt;<i> z-rotation too).
