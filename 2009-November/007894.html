<PRE>Hello Everyone,

I have been working on a project, called Distributed Procedural Creation
Project, at Forge for three months. If you are planing to inject something
(e.g. artwork, scientific data, etc) into regions, the project may work for
your purpose. But, I am afraid, it is obvious that the project is still on
the alpha stage. If you are interested in the project, please let me know
what you want to do using it. That'll encourage me to develop it further
on the right track sharing the goal with you.

Distributed Procedural Creation Project
<A HREF="http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/pcproject/">http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/pcproject/</A>

The following is an excerption from the project page:

Introduction

Procedural Creation Project provides yet another way to create virtual-world
contents, scripting all creation processes. The goal of the project, however,
is not necessarily to replace the interactive creation, which is the standard
way you have been already doing in modern virtual-world client software, such
as SL viewer and its variants. Instead, the project will propose an entirely
different approach for artists and designers to explore 3D drawings in
procedural fashion. Also, it will bring a promising interface for scientist
to visualize scientific data in virtual world.


Regards,
Takayuki Usui
