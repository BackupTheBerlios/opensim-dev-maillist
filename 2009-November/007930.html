<PRE>Ouch Michael, you cut me to the quick :)

The 3rd draft of the OpenSim User Manual I posted 29th Jan this year (unfortunately, despite a team being created, no-one added to it); my last Opensim tutorial I posted in Aug 2009 (Streaming Audio); I made blog posts about Opensim as recently as Sep and October, and posted in the SLU forum on Opensim on the 11th Nov; and throughout this year I have been answering questions on all the tutorials both on the tutorials pages and in SL.

I must admit that I was impressed as hell with Blue Mars when it came out, and have written on that almost as extensively as I have on Opensim. I have never considered Blue Mars to be a competitor in any way to Opensim (there is no standalone version of Blue Mars, it is purely a Linden-like commercial platform, and hence there is no question of marketing it to an opensource community such as Opensim), but I do consider it to be a competitor (when and if it is released) to Second Life. However, the UDK can be a competitor to Opensim (to be confirmed, tests ongoing), as it is available in server/client mode, and sandboxes have already been made. However, to ignore what I have also done for Opensim this year is a little unfair.

I still run my Opensim (using r.7302 !! , IMHO the most stable release ever made), and I will continue to answer questions about the tutorials until someone else takes them over (but I will be really surprised if anyone does come forward to take them over), or they become obsolete.

I could have just faded away, but I thought others might be interested in my reasons for finally calling it a day for Opensim (which I think is better than simply saying nothing), and indeed it does seem to have generated some debate.

As I said before, I do wish all the team all the very best of luck, and my good wishes go out for the future of Opensim.

Rock

Colin, i have not seen you on this project in like a year or more, this seems like nothing more than an attempt by you to market Blue Mars to this group..  You have done nothing but talk about blue mars for as long as I can remember now.. as far as I am concerned you left this project about a year ago.. You have not contributed anything to this project in at least that long..
