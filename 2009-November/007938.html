</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Len, let me give you an alternative perspective on that quote to help you
</I>&gt;<i> see the reasons for it.  I'm not on the Opensim team, but after five years
</I>&gt;<i> in SL, two years in AWG, and a year of working on future VW protocols in our
</I>&gt;<i> IETF group, I have some background to know why Opensim needs to distance
</I>&gt;<i> itself from SL:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - SL's statically tiled resource architecture is badly *non-scalable*,
</I>&gt;<i>    because most resource usage in VWs cannot be statically mapped (demand moves
</I>&gt;<i>    around).  The inability to assign resources dynamically in SL results in
</I>&gt;<i>    huge overload in busy places and gross wastage in idle areas.  It also
</I>&gt;<i>    limits the number of participants in events and the bandwidth of their
</I>&gt;<i>    interaction, as well as the size and complexity of everything in a region.
</I>&gt;<i>    This architecture is fundamental to SL, yet it is a recipe for failure.  As
</I>&gt;<i>    long as Opensim adheres to the SL model, Opensim will be similarly
</I>&gt;<i>    non-scalable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - The LSL scripting language is linguistically weak, semantically
</I>&gt;<i>    obscure, and lacking in the glue that could allow components to cooperate
</I>&gt;<i>    effectively.  As a result, individual scripts are quite underpowered and
</I>&gt;<i>    inefficient, and multi-script constructions do not scale well in complexity
</I>&gt;<i>    because the overheads of cooperation are so large.  That's a bad restriction
</I>&gt;<i>    on progress which Opensim needs to leave behind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - LSL scripts are not scalable in power or size, and this will continue
</I>&gt;<i>    to be true even after SL allows C# and other CLR languages to be used.
</I>&gt;<i>    There is no possibility of using more CPU power for scripting than is
</I>&gt;<i>    available in one single simulator in SL.  That is not a good foundation upon
</I>&gt;<i>    which to build an ambitious future of clever components.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - SL's simulation environment is non-portable, having evolved over time
</I>&gt;<i>    into a plethora of special cases that will not be accurately replicable
</I>&gt;<i>    anywhere else.  In effect this means that there will never be effective
</I>&gt;<i>    interop with SL's scripted objects.  It would not be a useful goal to seek
</I>&gt;<i>    compatibility with what could realistically be described as an &quot;ill-defined
</I>&gt;<i>    mess&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - SL's object and type systems are *non-extensible*, so compatibility
</I>&gt;<i>    with SL means living in the past, and worse, living in a past defined
</I>&gt;<i>    entirely by one slow-moving company.  Tying the capabilities of Opensim to
</I>&gt;<i>    that millstone would be a disaster --- it would ensure the death of Opensim
</I>&gt;<i>    versus any extensible alternative that may appear.  Developing new
</I>&gt;<i>    extensible forms of world data beyond SL's original set is a must for
</I>&gt;<i>    Opensim's survival as a modern VW platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - SL's viewer has deep knowledge of SL semantics because the client and
</I>&gt;<i>    server were designed for each other rather than designed as endpoints of a
</I>&gt;<i>    standard protocol.  This has the very bad consequence that future VW viewers
</I>&gt;<i>    would need to know about SL specifics in order to interoperate with SL,
</I>&gt;<i>    which is a poor approach that doesn't scale to metaverse-wide diversity.
</I>&gt;<i>    Opensim needs to leave world-specific kludges behind if it has ambitions to
</I>&gt;<i>    underpin a highly diverse metaverse of worlds, and this means leaving the SL
</I>&gt;<i>    viewer behind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - SL's constructed objects are *non-hierarchical*, which means that
</I>&gt;<i>    creators cannot use objects created by others as subcomponents.  This
</I>&gt;<i>    restriction completely blocks the hierarchical engineering process that is
</I>&gt;<i>    the basis of progress in RL.  In SL you always have to build from &quot;raw
</I>&gt;<i>    materials&quot;, so it is not possible to ride on the shoulders of giants, nor
</I>&gt;<i>    harness a huge pyramid of people skills.  Even Philip and Cory Linden
</I>&gt;<i>    admitted that this was a mistake -- see
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Prim_and_Object_Hierarchy">https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Prim_and_Object_Hierarchy</A> .  We don't
</I>&gt;<i>    want to live with their mistake.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - SL is based on highly *centralized* concepts of *identity, storage
</I>&gt;<i>    and control*, which come together to create either a walled garden or a
</I>&gt;<i>    prison planet, depending on one's perspective.  Whatever one's worldview,
</I>&gt;<i>    the end result is badly non-scalable in those three areas.  SL suffers
</I>&gt;<i>    hugely from that non-scalability despite the relatively small size of the
</I>&gt;<i>    service at this early stage.  Opensim needs decentralized / distributed
</I>&gt;<i>    mechanisms for *identity, storage and control* if it is to scale for
</I>&gt;<i>    Internet-wide adoption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - From a futurist angle, Second Life has very narrow horizons and
</I>&gt;<i>    barely pays lip service to the *virtual* aspect of &quot;virtual worlds&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>    Nobody could claim that a Flatland of square land tiles all featuring the
</I>&gt;<i>    same Earth-like look and physics pushes the envelope of the imagination.  To
</I>&gt;<i>    boldly go where Lindens did not go before (topologically and geographically
</I>&gt;<i>    or spatially) will be one of the most appreciated developments in Opensim.
</I>&gt;<i>    SL's obsession with RL is an unwanted constraint in VWs, and we need to go
</I>&gt;<i>    beyond it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is not the full list of problems with SL, but hopefully it serves to
</I>&gt;<i> illustrate some of the concerns that VW developers have to consider in the
</I>&gt;<i> light of the SL legacy.  While Linden Lab deserves much applause for their
</I>&gt;<i> vision and for their work in creating Second Life, many years have now
</I>&gt;<i> passed, and lessons have been learned.  Compatibility with SL must not be
</I>&gt;<i> the end goal of Opensim because of issues like those highlighted above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From a longer perspective, SL represents only the first step in the
</I>&gt;<i> evolution of virtual worlds.  It is no surprise that most Opensim developers
</I>&gt;<i> wish to go beyond that first step, learning from past mistakes and finding
</I>&gt;<i> better models for the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mentioned earlier our work at the IETF on new VW protocols, in which LL
</I>&gt;<i> are a leading party --- see  <A HREF="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ogpx">https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ogpx</A> ,
</I>&gt;<i> the mailing list of the VWRAP working group.  What may surprise you is that
</I>&gt;<i> even Lindens know that the current SL is not a good model for the future,
</I>&gt;<i> which is why the protocols being discussed go far beyond their legacy ones.
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, Lindens will be facing a huge rewrite if this work bears fruit.
</I>&gt;<i> When even Lindens don't wish their future to be constrained by the current
</I>&gt;<i> SL design because they know its many problems, this really highlights how
</I>&gt;<i> bad it would be for the Opensim team to do so. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that one or more of these issues resonates with you, and makes it a
</I>&gt;<i> bit clearer why Opensim really cannot afford to align itself with SL.  There
</I>&gt;<i> is no future in looking backwards.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim I'd do more proactively by giving content.  So I plan to do just
</I>&gt;<i> that and give my money to other open source initiatives that matter to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I have a passion for writing, and have thought many times that one of

</I>&gt;<i> there was appointed a volunteer whose sole job was to keep information on
</I>&gt;<i> opensimulator.org relevant that one task would resolve a mountain of
</I>&gt;<i> negativity right there.  I sit here in front of my computers a good 10 to 12
</I>&gt;<i> hours a day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I would sincerely love to contribute to the OpenSim project,
</I>&gt;<i> especially in documentation support.  But the thing holding me back is
</I>&gt;<i> communication.  If I cannot get a straight answer on who to GIVE money to in
</I>&gt;<i> order to help, then I stand little chance of getting clear, straight answers
</I>&gt;<i> from developers when asking about issues I need to consider and incorporate

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      If communication is a hurdle we can all overcome, with a genuine and

</I>&gt;<i> Hi guys,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have decided to leave the Opensim project. You will probably not even
</I>&gt;<i> notice if I leave, as not being a programmer my only inputs were the writing
</I>&gt;<i> of the step-by-step tutorials ( <A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/">http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/</A>), the drafts of the OpenSim User Manual on the Forge, and helping out in
</I>&gt;<i> the IRC channels, for newcomers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may find my reasons for leaving Opensim interesting though (and please
</I>&gt;<i> do not construe any of my reasons as an attack on anyone).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The Platform
</I>&gt;<i> I raised this several times in the past in IRC, and made posts on my blog
</I>&gt;<i> about the product lifecycle of the platform (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://rock-vacirca.blogspot.com/2009/02/direction-of-virtual-worlds.html">http://rock-vacirca.blogspot.com/2009/02/direction-of-virtual-worlds.html</A>). I believe that the platforms underpinning both Second Life and Opensim
</I>&gt;<i> are quite long in the tooth now, and I questioned how much product lifecycle
</I>&gt;<i> there was left, particularly given that Opensim is now nearing 3 years of
</I>&gt;<i> development, is still in Alpha, and if the current release of 0.6.7 is any
</I>&gt;<i> indicator, then still only around two thirds into the development cycle.
</I>&gt;<i> With the (inevitable) coming of much superior platforms, such as Blue Mars
</I>&gt;<i> and (as a virtual world); Unity, for browser-based Virtual Wolrds; and now
</I>&gt;<i> UDK (for creating sandboxes, standalones, and open grids), then I fear that
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim has missed the boat as far as the remaining lifecycle of the
</I>&gt;<i> platform is concerned. When you show people what is possible with these
</I>&gt;<i> engines (for example this avatar editor for the forthcom
</I>&gt;<i>  ing APB (using the Unreal Engine):
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icR3LtEMvZI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icR3LtEMvZI</A> or this city:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmLzNbPXMDg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmLzNbPXMDg</A> (using the CryEngine), then
</I>&gt;<i> neither SL not Opensim stands comparison.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Lack of Support for Currency in Opensim
</I>&gt;<i> I felt the impact of this when I first made the switch from SL to Opensim.
</I>&gt;<i> I had a thriving RP sim in SL (over 50 people, mainly female) and they all
</I>&gt;<i> agreed to follow me over to my Opensim and the OSGrid. However, within a
</I>&gt;<i> month they had all left, citing the same reason, the lack of places to shop,
</I>&gt;<i> to buy the quality stuff they wanted (skins, hair, clothes etc), as a
</I>&gt;<i> quality appearance, and the fun of shopping is what all the females placed
</I>&gt;<i> high on their requirements from a Virtual World. They drifted back to Second
</I>&gt;<i> Life, and the guys followed them. I have always believed that the lack of
</I>&gt;<i> support for currency in the core was a mistake, but that is just my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Marketing
</I>&gt;<i> I have also raised this issue several times, and blogged about it. It is
</I>&gt;<i> far from clear just who an eventually released Opensim is actually aimed at.
</I>&gt;<i> I think that any company that is interested in a firewalled corporate
</I>&gt;<i> solution to collaboration and prototyping will already be looking at the
</I>&gt;<i> Enterprise solution that is currently available from Second Life; that any
</I>&gt;<i> indie group that is thinking of running a themed grid will need an economy
</I>&gt;<i> to stay viable; and any individual who is looking for a private sandbox
</I>&gt;<i> solution for their SL work will need full compatibility (which is not the
</I>&gt;<i> case with the OS version of LSL diverging from the SL LSL). So, just who is
</I>&gt;<i> the platform aimed at? I was also very disappointed in the view of one of
</I>&gt;<i> the core devs who said that 'marketing is a null concept for us'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am currently designing and creating cities for Blue Mars, and involved in
</I>&gt;<i> a team for proving the UDK as a platform for the design and creation of
</I>&gt;<i> Virtual Worlds (as opposed to purely games), and with so much documentation
</I>&gt;<i> available for these mature engines (particularly for the UDK, Blue Mars lags
</I>&gt;<i> behind somewhat in that department, but have hired extra staff to put that
</I>&gt;<i> right), I am achieving the productivity I want, building the worlds that I
</I>&gt;<i> want, with stable crash-free platforms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I do wish the Opensim team the very best in their endeavours, and
</I>&gt;<i> I sincerely hope their goals are eventually achieved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone would like to take over the Opensim Tutorials pages at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/">http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/</A> and
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse2.blogspot.com/">http://chapter-and-metaverse2.blogspot.com/</A> (they will need some updating
</I>&gt;<i> following several changes) then I am more than willing to pass the posts
</I>&gt;<i> over, and of course the Opensim User Manual is there in the Forge for anyone
</I>&gt;<i> to develop further.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards and Good Luck
