<PRE>Len,

You have it right..

As an expereinced project manager, I have watched in dismay as time and time
again,  people willing and WANTING to help move OpenSim forward have found
themselves frustrated by a lack of BASIC documentation on the configuration
of the &quot;platform&quot;.   The current attitude of &quot; feel free to contribute by
updating the wiki&quot; completely IGNORES the fact that recent changes to the
basic infrastructure makes most &quot;part-time&quot; participants working knowledge
of the solutions obsolete.   I can write 4 dozen  wiki pages a day,  but
since I haven't been able to get OpenSim configured and working since just
after the conversion to GIT,  they would be useless and misleading to anyone
who was seriously interested in testing.    Being a volunteer
programmer/developer on an open source project should not mean that coders
get to &quot;blow off&quot; design and implementation documentation  because  &quot;its a
community effort&quot;.  In fact.. One reason why finding good open source
developers is so difficult is because it requires they have the skills and
dedication to champion and SELL the technical solutions they are proposing.

While core continues to pontificate on the importance of people building
applications on the &quot;platform&quot; provided, and this &quot;vision of community
joining together&quot;,  they also continue to insist on utilizing IRC as the
primary means of group communication.  This means that developers are
answering  the SAME questions over and over and over,  and those of us  who
CAN&quot;T spend our days connected to all 200 of our &quot;chat spaces&quot;  don't have
access to the information that was exchanged while we were off-line.  It's
telling that ALL of the major players in the space have understood and
adopted web space, wikis, and basic forums for &quot;customer support&quot; when it
come to the applications THEY have built on the platform.

I have a TON of respect for the job that has been done,  and I don't share
your pessimistic view of the future.  It's sad that it takes posts like this
to revive the discussions about what it will take to make OpenSim viable and
successful...  but it isn't surprising.   To me...the Alpha tag on the
software is less an indication on its technical sopsitication and
capabilities  as it is an acknowledgement by the developers  that they
haven't been completely successful building the &quot;whole community&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i> No, Kyle tells it as he sees it and I respect that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Right now invite 100 people, no 10, no, just 1 person to go to
</I>&gt;<i> opensimulator.org and tell them to follow the directions provided on the
</I>&gt;<i> site and have them run an opensim server.  They cannot do it.  Pure and
</I>&gt;<i> simple.  I know because I directed dozens, if not hundreds of people to
</I>&gt;<i> opensimulator.org off my own full island I had in Second Life (Liberia
</I>&gt;<i> Cove) dedicated to telling others about penSim.  Not one single person was
</I>&gt;<i> able to get OpenSim running without considerable assistance from me and
</I>&gt;<i> others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      This one single issue is the core of what bothers me above all
</I>&gt;<i> others.  And yes, one can create an account and &quot;edit the pages&quot; oneself.
</I>&gt;<i> But one cannot edit something one does not already understand, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      If you have never built a coal mine then how would you be able to
</I>&gt;<i> write its instruction manual?  To this day I have barely a working knowledge
</I>&gt;<i> of OpenSim and that has been greatly facilitated by Diva through the diva
</I>&gt;<i> distribution and assistance I've received from patrons of OSGrid (which I've
</I>&gt;<i> paid to receive help from as it seemed the only way to get anyone to talk
</I>&gt;<i> with me seriously on these issues is to fork over cash, and lots of it)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Interestingly enough, the only version of OpenSim I have ever been
</I>&gt;<i> able to get running entirely from raw code through compilation was 0.6.5.1
</I>&gt;<i> and I miss those days almost every day.  It was so simple anyone with basic
</I>&gt;<i> pc understanding could run a server from scratch and I witnessed it time and
</I>&gt;<i> again.  I'd even wrote a manual on running OpenSim and MySQL entirely
</I>&gt;<i> portably and it worked flawlessly.  No changes had to be made to a pc and I
</I>&gt;<i> was working on a version that worked on Windows, Mac and Linux when 0.6.6
</I>&gt;<i> came out and broke everything (I do not blame anyone for that, but am upset
</I>&gt;<i> I could not get anyone to help me fix the problems).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I REALLY DO want to contribute and have a huge stake in this and
</I>&gt;<i> financial gain is NOT my goal and never has been.  I am just one who
</I>&gt;<i> despises anything but the plain truth and simple facts.  KISS - Keep It
</I>&gt;<i> Simple, Stupid.  An important motto.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      My entire life revolves around sitting in front of a computer.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, for me, about 80% of the time I'm laying in front of mine.
</I>&gt;<i> Believe me when I say that my life depends on computers in more ways than
</I>&gt;<i> you could imagine.  OpenSim has been my &quot;cheap-alternative&quot; breath of fresh
</I>&gt;<i> air from Second Life and I take it personally when I read that OpenSim is
</I>&gt;<i> not intended as an alternative to Second Life when it most obviously is -
</I>&gt;<i> *to me*.  And that is what matters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *     Can we not seemingly &quot;put the brakes on&quot; everything and work on the
</I>&gt;<i> site, the very first place most people see when they search for &quot;open
</I>&gt;<i> simulator&quot;?  It should be clean, clear, simple, friendly, and above all,
</I>&gt;<i> point directly to answers, solutions, simple resolutions to the main reason
</I>&gt;<i> why the multitude come to opensimulator.org - to download it, install it,
</I>&gt;<i> and use it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why must that be so difficult?*

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  I would like to thank the Opensim developers for producing an

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and yet this is exactly why the developers are so concerned with
</I>&gt;<i> building
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a platform for solutions for you to build upon, not a solution in
</I>&gt;<i> itself.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Why did they choose this path of pluggable architecture and not deliver
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; solution in their vision?   Because they have a vision bigger than
</I>&gt;<i> that,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; they envision a community rallying around their hard work on the core
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this system who add in their own needed elements on top of the base
</I>&gt;<i> being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; created.  To complain that you have not made a profit from the hard
</I>&gt;<i> work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of the volunteer developers shows a distinct lack of appreciation and a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; lack of personal motivation to get things done as an individual working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with a larger group.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I myself experiment with Unity3D to handle some things OpenSim does not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; focus on.  However the magic of Opensim, easy user created content, is
</I>&gt;<i> no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; trivial matter to recreate elsewhere.  Most do not understand the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; difficult architecture of building a real-time, user created system.
</I>&gt;<i>  To
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; make any other platform do this aspect is no trivial task which is why
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Opensim is the only alternative out there to SL (same company that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; promised an opensource server).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So if you are leaving because an extensible platform that took years
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; volunteers to get has not catered to your specific needs then you
</I>&gt;<i> missed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the point of community.  IBM has not left Opensim I talk to them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; regularly and they are extremely motivated to see this project succeed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In fact those leaving are missing 2010, which I feel is going to be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; banner year for Opensim.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; While I understand the frustration of the lack of features vs SL and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; others I also understand the magic of, for example,  a teacher and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; student building concepts together with easy to use, affordable tools.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This community has given freely and I for one bow in respect to these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; gracious, giving and dedicated developers and testers and understand
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; incredibly complex job they face.  Kudos Opensim we are with you for

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If the goal of OpenSim is to be incompatible with everyone elses vision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; then I too have little further interest in the project.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'd hoped after IBM dropped OpenSim like a hot potato that the devs
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; realize the err of their ways and come round to a manageable and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; collaborative progression from then on, but unfortunately that doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; seem to be the case.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If the goal of OpenSim is to be &quot;something different&quot; but without any
</I>&gt;<i> aim
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; towards mass acceptance and compatibility than I too feel my time is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; wasted.  I have spent 8 to 12 hours a day for many weeks tediously
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; copying hundreds of items from my stores and shops in Second Life to my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; private home-hosted OpenSim regions foolishly believing that they will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; remain compatible through OpenSim's future progression and that I could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in turn share a good portion of my work with others since my desire for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; investment has been repeatedly turned down.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; hits the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; opensimulator.org site and that is where the massive roadblock
</I>&gt;<i> presents
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; itself.  It's useless for most and irrelevant to the few who consider
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; themselves OpenSim experts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;      Heck, even now on the configuration page it still displays info
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 0.6.6 including (months old) known bugs in setting up region xml files.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If there was appointed a volunteer whose sole job was to keep
</I>&gt;<i> information
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; on opensimulator.org relevant that one task would resolve a mountain
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; negativity right there.  I sit here in front of my computers a good 10
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 12 hours a day.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;      I would sincerely love to contribute to the OpenSim project,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; especially in documentation support.  But the thing holding me back is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; communication.  If I cannot get a straight answer on who to GIVE money
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in order to help, then I stand little chance of getting clear, straight
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; answers from developers when asking about issues I need to consider and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; incorporate in documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;      If communication is a hurdle we can all overcome, with a genuine
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; heart-felt effort to relay information, motives, and plans with one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; another, then I'd sincerely appreciate having the opportunity to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; personally contribute.  I'm not a programmer today, but have a degree
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; programming fro the 90's (so much has changed my degree is practically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; useless in that regard).  But I do know how to explain things and relay
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; information in simple terms.  But only if my own questions will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; answered with more than &quot;look it up or figure it out yourself&quot; as my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; answer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;      If any of you would appreciate my help, feel free to let me know
</I>&gt;<i> at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; any time and I'll do what I can.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hi guys,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I have decided to leave the Opensim project. You will probably not even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; notice if I leave, as not being a programmer my only inputs were the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; writing of the step-by-step tutorials (
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/">http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/</A>), the drafts of the OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; User Manual on the Forge, and helping out in the IRC channels, for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; newcomers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You may find my reasons for leaving Opensim interesting though (and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; please do not construe any of my reasons as an attack on anyone).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 1. The Platform
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I raised this several times in the past in IRC, and made posts on my
</I>&gt;<i> blog
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; about the product lifecycle of the platform (
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://rock-vacirca.blogspot.com/2009/02/direction-of-virtual-worlds.html">http://rock-vacirca.blogspot.com/2009/02/direction-of-virtual-worlds.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;). I believe that the platforms underpinning both Second Life and
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; are quite long in the tooth now, and I questioned how much product
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; lifecycle there was left, particularly given that Opensim is now
</I>&gt;<i> nearing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 3 years of development, is still in Alpha, and if the current release
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 0.6.7 is any indicator, then still only around two thirds into the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; development cycle. With the (inevitable) coming of much superior
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; platforms, such as Blue Mars and (as a virtual world); Unity, for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; browser-based Virtual Wolrds; and now UDK (for creating sandboxes,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; standalones, and open grids), then I fear that Opensim has missed the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; boat as far as the remaining lifecycle of the platform is concerned.
</I>&gt;<i> When
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you show people what is possible with these engines (for example this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; avatar editor for the forthcom
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  ing APB (using the Unreal Engine):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icR3LtEMvZI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icR3LtEMvZI</A> or this city:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmLzNbPXMDg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmLzNbPXMDg</A> (using the CryEngine), then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; neither SL not Opensim stands comparison.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2. Lack of Support for Currency in Opensim
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I felt the impact of this when I first made the switch from SL to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Opensim. I had a thriving RP sim in SL (over 50 people, mainly female)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and they all agreed to follow me over to my Opensim and the OSGrid.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; However, within a month they had all left, citing the same reason, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; lack of places to shop, to buy the quality stuff they wanted (skins,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; hair, clothes etc), as a quality appearance, and the fun of shopping is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; what all the females placed high on their requirements from a Virtual
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; World. They drifted back to Second Life, and the guys followed them. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have always believed that the lack of support for currency in the core
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; was a mistake, but that is just my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 3. Marketing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I have also raised this issue several times, and blogged about it. It
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; far from clear just who an eventually released Opensim is actually
</I>&gt;<i> aimed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; at. I think that any company that is interested in a firewalled
</I>&gt;<i> corporate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; solution to collaboration and prototyping will already be looking at
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Enterprise solution that is currently available from Second Life; that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; any indie group that is thinking of running a themed grid will need an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; economy to stay viable; and any individual who is looking for a private
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sandbox solution for their SL work will need full compatibility (which
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; not the case with the OS version of LSL diverging from the SL LSL). So,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; just who is the platform aimed at? I was also very disappointed in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; view of one of the core devs who said that 'marketing is a null concept
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for us'.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I am currently designing and creating cities for Blue Mars, and
</I>&gt;<i> involved
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in a team for proving the UDK as a platform for the design and creation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of Virtual Worlds (as opposed to purely games), and with so much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; documentation available for these mature engines (particularly for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; UDK, Blue Mars lags behind somewhat in that department, but have hired
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; extra staff to put that right), I am achieving the productivity I want,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; building the worlds that I want, with stable crash-free platforms.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; However, I do wish the Opensim team the very best in their endeavours,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and I sincerely hope their goals are eventually achieved.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If anyone would like to take over the Opensim Tutorials pages at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/">http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/</A> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse2.blogspot.com/">http://chapter-and-metaverse2.blogspot.com/</A> (they will need some
</I>&gt;<i> updating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; following several changes) then I am more than willing to pass the
</I>&gt;<i> posts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; over, and of course the Opensim User Manual is there in the Forge for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; anyone to develop further.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Best Regards and Good Luck
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Rock
