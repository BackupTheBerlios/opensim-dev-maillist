<PRE>If the goal of OpenSim is to be incompatible with everyone elses vision then
I too have little further interest in the project.

I'd hoped after IBM dropped OpenSim like a hot potato that the devs would
realize the err of their ways and come round to a manageable and
collaborative progression from then on, but unfortunately that doesn't seem
to be the case.

If the goal of OpenSim is to be &quot;something different&quot; but without any aim
towards mass acceptance and compatibility than I too feel my time is
wasted.  I have spent 8 to 12 hours a day for many weeks tediously copying
hundreds of items from my stores and shops in Second Life to my private
home-hosted OpenSim regions foolishly believing that they will remain
compatible through OpenSim's future progression and that I could in turn
share a good portion of my work with others since my desire for investment
has been repeatedly turned down.

I wish you all the best on your path.

</I>&gt;<i> Rock,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I sympathize with you on many levels.  I've also had my doubts
</I>&gt;<i> regarding the future of OpenSim, but I have also maintained some degree of
</I>&gt;<i> faith that things will pull through in the end.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      For me the shock came when I was abruptly informed that &quot;OpenSim is
</I>&gt;<i> not Second Life, is not intended to be like Second Life, nor ever will.&quot;  I
</I>&gt;<i> still haven't the foggiest idea what this developer had smoked for them to
</I>&gt;<i> so strongly assert that incredibly false statement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      For me, the enjoyment of OpenSim has come from my intense devotion to
</I>&gt;<i> building and skinning.  In fact, for the last few months I've been working
</I>&gt;<i> on a full region that has many hundreds of skins, clothes, hair, furniture,
</I>&gt;<i> etc, etc, that I'd like to package up as an OAR and give out freely, since
</I>&gt;<i> repeatedly I've been told that instead of giving money to help further
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim I'd do more proactively by giving content.  So I plan to do just
</I>&gt;<i> that and give my money to other open source initiatives that matter to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I have a passion for writing, and have thought many times that one of
</I>&gt;<i> the greatest powers OpenSim would gain is having simple, straightforward,
</I>&gt;<i> step-by-step instructions on how to download, compile, install, administer
</I>&gt;<i> and overall just plain operate the core applications.  What kills me is that
</I>&gt;<i> everyone who does a search for OpenSim inevitably hits the
</I>&gt;<i> opensimulator.org site and that is where the massive roadblock presents
</I>&gt;<i> itself.  It's useless for most and irrelevant to the few who consider
</I>&gt;<i> themselves OpenSim experts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Heck, even now on the configuration page it still displays info for
</I>&gt;<i> 0.6.6 including (months old) known bugs in setting up region xml files.  If
</I>&gt;<i> there was appointed a volunteer whose sole job was to keep information on
</I>&gt;<i> opensimulator.org relevant that one task would resolve a mountain of
</I>&gt;<i> negativity right there.  I sit here in front of my computers a good 10 to 12
</I>&gt;<i> hours a day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I would sincerely love to contribute to the OpenSim project,
</I>&gt;<i> especially in documentation support.  But the thing holding me back is
</I>&gt;<i> communication.  If I cannot get a straight answer on who to GIVE money to in
</I>&gt;<i> order to help, then I stand little chance of getting clear, straight answers
</I>&gt;<i> from developers when asking about issues I need to consider and incorporate
</I>&gt;<i> in documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      If communication is a hurdle we can all overcome, with a genuine and
</I>&gt;<i> heart-felt effort to relay information, motives, and plans with one another,
</I>&gt;<i> then I'd sincerely appreciate having the opportunity to personally
</I>&gt;<i> contribute.  I'm not a programmer today, but have a degree in programming
</I>&gt;<i> fro the 90's (so much has changed my degree is practically useless in that
</I>&gt;<i> regard).  But I do know how to explain things and relay information in
</I>&gt;<i> simple terms.  But only if my own questions will be answered with more than
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;look it up or figure it out yourself&quot; as my answer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      If any of you would appreciate my help, feel free to let me know at
</I>&gt;<i> any time and I'll do what I can.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi guys,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have decided to leave the Opensim project. You will probably not even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notice if I leave, as not being a programmer my only inputs were the writing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the step-by-step tutorials (
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/">http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/</A> ), the drafts of the OpenSim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> User Manual on the Forge, and helping out in the IRC channels, for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> newcomers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You may find my reasons for leaving Opensim interesting though (and please
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do not construe any of my reasons as an attack on anyone).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. The Platform
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I raised this several times in the past in IRC, and made posts on my blog
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about the product lifecycle of the platform (
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://rock-vacirca.blogspot.com/2009/02/direction-of-virtual-worlds.html">http://rock-vacirca.blogspot.com/2009/02/direction-of-virtual-worlds.html</A>). I believe that the platforms underpinning both Second Life and Opensim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are quite long in the tooth now, and I questioned how much product lifecycle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there was left, particularly given that Opensim is now nearing 3 years of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development, is still in Alpha, and if the current release of 0.6.7 is any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indicator, then still only around two thirds into the development cycle.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With the (inevitable) coming of much superior platforms, such as Blue Mars
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and (as a virtual world); Unity, for browser-based Virtual Wolrds; and now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> UDK (for creating sandboxes, standalones, and open grids), then I fear that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Opensim has missed the boat as far as the remaining lifecycle of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platform is concerned. When you show people what is possible with these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engines (for example this avatar editor for the forthcom
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  ing APB (using the Unreal Engine):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icR3LtEMvZI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icR3LtEMvZI</A> or this city:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmLzNbPXMDg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmLzNbPXMDg</A> (using the CryEngine), then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> neither SL not Opensim stands comparison.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Lack of Support for Currency in Opensim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I felt the impact of this when I first made the switch from SL to Opensim.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had a thriving RP sim in SL (over 50 people, mainly female) and they all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agreed to follow me over to my Opensim and the OSGrid. However, within a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> month they had all left, citing the same reason, the lack of places to shop,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to buy the quality stuff they wanted (skins, hair, clothes etc), as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quality appearance, and the fun of shopping is what all the females placed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> high on their requirements from a Virtual World. They drifted back to Second
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Life, and the guys followed them. I have always believed that the lack of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support for currency in the core was a mistake, but that is just my opinion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Marketing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have also raised this issue several times, and blogged about it. It is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> far from clear just who an eventually released Opensim is actually aimed at.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think that any company that is interested in a firewalled corporate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution to collaboration and prototyping will already be looking at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Enterprise solution that is currently available from Second Life; that any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indie group that is thinking of running a themed grid will need an economy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to stay viable; and any individual who is looking for a private sandbox
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution for their SL work will need full compatibility (which is not the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case with the OS version of LSL diverging from the SL LSL). So, just who is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the platform aimed at? I was also very disappointed in the view of one of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the core devs who said that 'marketing is a null concept for us'.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am currently designing and creating cities for Blue Mars, and involved
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a team for proving the UDK as a platform for the design and creation of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Virtual Worlds (as opposed to purely games), and with so much documentation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available for these mature engines (particularly for the UDK, Blue Mars lags
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behind somewhat in that department, but have hired extra staff to put that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right), I am achieving the productivity I want, building the worlds that I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want, with stable crash-free platforms.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I do wish the Opensim team the very best in their endeavours, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I sincerely hope their goals are eventually achieved.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If anyone would like to take over the Opensim Tutorials pages at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/">http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/</A> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse2.blogspot.com/">http://chapter-and-metaverse2.blogspot.com/</A> (they will need some updating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> following several changes) then I am more than willing to pass the posts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over, and of course the Opensim User Manual is there in the Forge for anyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to develop further.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Best Regards and Good Luck
