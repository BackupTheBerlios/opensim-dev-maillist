<PRE>Wow everyone.  I should take afternoon naps more often.  I've slept and
rested, and read all the replies that have filtered down since my first
&quot;outburst&quot; this morning and I would gladly be willing to assist in any
proper way that I can.

As Kyle said, so kindly, it is far more fruitful if we work together, but as
others have said - a willingness to help without knowing just where or how
to begin is just as fruitless as no help at all.

I would love to have the opportunity to collaborate on a way to develop a
straightforward and simplistic compile-install-administer wiki that we can
all work on, tweak, proof, rearrange, etc.

As a brief background, I have years of past experience in basic programming,
html/css web design and current very thorough understanding of
MySQL/WordPress/MediaWiki/etc.

Also, last week I re-activated domain names I've owned for many years that
all route to the core domain www.lenfocenter.com - &quot;The Lenformation Center&quot;
- ha!, back when I was a bright eye'd graduate student I thought
Lenformation - all there was to know about me (Len) - was such a cool idea.
Currenty it just says &quot;coming soon.&quot;

I've been planning to use the domain more as a means of relaying specific
topics of interest to me, and hoped when re-activating the domain recently
that I'd further the development of the &quot;Portable OpenSim Platform&quot; I had
invested a lot of time in earlier this year.

BUT, in agreement with others - if we can collaborate and converse, I would
be happy to offer anything I can with the resources I have, as I'm sure
others would too.

And on the side, if there is a need for any additional temporary forums,
wiki's, etc - my domain is hosted on a very reliable and high-throughput
backbone and I have dedicated access to implement up to two high-use MySQL
databases.  Again, should the need or desire arise, that is what I have to
offer by way of resources.  I can also secure a domain for additional use at
any time (takes effect within 1 to 2 hours 24/7).

Personally, my chief interest would be in documentation, writing
step-by-step procedures, and so forth.  I'm also good with taking and
editing screen-shots and assembling step-wise procedures for following along
- that are print-ready.

Feel free to contact me via email and briefly familiarize me with any other
means of communication - IRC, IM, etc.  I use Pigeon and have access to
Yahoo IM, MSN (Hotmail) IM, Google/gMail Chat, and ICQ, but could
accommodate another means if necessary.

Just let me know and I'll be ready to take part.

- Len W. Brown
