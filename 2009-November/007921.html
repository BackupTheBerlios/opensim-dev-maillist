<PRE>Let's all group up on the website, Adam has some very cool new layout ideas
so if we formed a small website dev group to work with him I think we could
have some exciting stuff ready by Jan 1.  Count us in!
<A HREF="http://indiemetaverse.ning.com">http://indiemetaverse.ning.com</A> is one place smaller developers are gathering
to help with such projects. I'll add a group there for improving
documentation to help from our side get things rolling.  Any other ideas to
pool up on this sub-project?

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Leaving Project

Hey Guys I am pretty new to OpenSim and in no way a c/c++/c# coder but
I am a web developer and I wouldn't mind helping with the website. I
too have failed to build OpenSim successfully since the only docs on
the website are so outdated and so many changes have been made. I
don't know what help I could be but I am a very experience PHP
programmer and my kung fu with things like css/xhtml/jquery are pretty
strong too :) and my abilities with photoshop isnt to shabby either.
Maybe giving the site a face lift on top of making top of updating the
documentation might keep the interest spark lit.

On IRC I am digitalfiz I will be back on there later today to see
whats going on. Just let me know how I can help.
