<PRE>Great email Morgaine, I totally agree.  What I think was most silly to me
about Colin's announcement that he was leaving the development group, was
that he was not really ever part of the development group, he was not
submitting code, or even really working the core devs to report or test
their code, at least not in about a year.   Anyone who wants to work with
the group and express their feelings in a direct manner should join the IRC
channel (#osgrid-dev on irc.freenode.net) and speak directly with the
developers and work directly with them and try to avoid just creating drama
on the email list in a hit and run fashion.  and Just because you can write
code, that does not automatically qualify you to be part of the team, this
group is looking for people who are honest and patient and work well with
the other devs and testers, Threatening to leave or not share code because
someone has upset you will only get you shown where the door is, and likely
make it much harder for you to be involved in the future.  I only ask that
everyone show a little patience and gratitude to those working very hard on
the project, and not threaten them saying you are going to leave if things
don't go your way, cause honestly we would just rather see you leave than
have to deal with that all the time.

&gt;<i> The recent thread about &quot;Leaving Opensim&quot; highlights that not everyone has
</I>&gt;<i> yet absorbed the impact of recent changes in SCM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While it's true that the Opensim Core group still operates partly as a
</I>&gt;<i> Cathedral (because they anoint *people* to join them, instead of picking
</I>&gt;<i> code contributions on the merits of the code), the project's SCM moved from
</I>&gt;<i> SVN to Git a little while ago, and this brings about a profound change.
</I>&gt;<i> It's not merely a different SCM tool, but a change from centralized to
</I>&gt;<i> distributed code management, and this brings Opensim almost entirely into
</I>&gt;<i> the Bazaar model.  (Non-programmers may want to see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/&lt;http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/&lt;http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> if this is new.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With Git, everyone's repository for the project has equal standing, and
</I>&gt;<i> anyone can clone their own repository, make changes, and advertise their
</I>&gt;<i> improvements.  Approval by the Core team is not required, and nothing
</I>&gt;<i> important distinguishes Opensim Core's own repository from any other.  The
</I>&gt;<i> system is truly distributed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a result, there is no need for anyone to &quot;leave Opensim&quot; owing to
</I>&gt;<i> divergence of views or direction.  Just clone your own repo and let people
</I>&gt;<i> know about it.  If your contributions are useful, people will merge your
</I>&gt;<i> changes into their own clones of the Core repo, or will follow your branch,
</I>&gt;<i> or will clone your own repo wholesale.  It's like old-fashioned forking but
</I>&gt;<i> without the hassles of forking, and with much reduced chasing of tail
</I>&gt;<i> lights. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In time, I expect that the Opensim Core developer group will be replaced by
</I>&gt;<i> a Steering Group, perhaps once version 1.0 has been reached and a public
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim Foundation has been created.  The steering group could select and
</I>&gt;<i> test well-regarded public contributions from a large number of community
</I>&gt;<i> developer Git repositories, picked on the basis of consistency and community
</I>&gt;<i> needs.  Then the Bazaar will truly have arrived.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But we're almost there anyway, because the tools already allow it.  There
</I>&gt;<i> is no need to leave, just join the Git bazaar. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
