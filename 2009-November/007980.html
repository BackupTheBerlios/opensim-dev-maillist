<PRE>I just want to say I am very grateful to all developers, testers and 
people writing user notes and documentation on the project. Some of 
which we have used to assist us, and to which we have contributed 
when we have had knowledge to offer.  I do realise that community 
members will come and ago as their interests change, but its 
important that everyone feels part of the whole venture, and that 
they realise that their contribution is valued by others.

Opensim is a potentially very useful platform and modular extension 
to some things happening in Second Life and elsewhere, while having a 
large degree of compatibility - and asset transfer - which is very 
useful to many of us.
