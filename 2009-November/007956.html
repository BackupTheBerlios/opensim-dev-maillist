Hello all,

On the subject of difficulties encountered when compiling opensim - I think use of the batch files makes it quite easy, but it does require you to understand 'pre-build', 'compile', and to look in the bin folder for the results.

The head scratching moment for me was when running opensim.exe it closed immediately.  The error message of not having an ini file is only visible if you run it through command prompt.  If the window would pause open when just double clicked on, it would be an improvement.

Overall I'm amazed at what has been achieved, but as people have said, the first impression counts.  All the required information is on the website, but it's a bit overwhelming.  Most people will only need a hand-full of steps to get it running, and that's all they should see unless they have problems.

Just a face-lift for a wider audience.  I'd be happy to be involved.

Cheers,

Matthew

Hi all,



Very interesting debate you have going on here.



Just to summarise, it seems to me that while the project roadmap so far has
been to implement copy of Second Life the general feeling is that we are now
pretty much there and it is time to go after even greater things and we need
to decide a product road map on our own from here. Hope I am summarising all
this correctly from all emails flying around?



There are as many business models in the mix as there are companies
involved. While my company makes money from utilising OpenSim as an engine
for private virtual worlds and business applications we develop for our
customers, there are people elsewhere whose main interest is to create
global public access grids to compete with other virtual worlds such as
Second Life. I think it is important that the focus remains considering
OpenSim as an engine and this way everyone's business models can be
satisfied (hopefully).



Just quickly about the debate around the compatibility between Second Life
and OpenSim. Which ever way this all goes, long term virtual worlds will
definitely need a standard ways to communicate. It is important that
different platforms can talk with each other if we aim for a 3D internet.
Traditional internet would not have taken off the same way if there would
have been only 1 web server vendor to use (does not matter would it been
Apache or MS IIS). So lets make sure that our product roadmap does listen /
follow what other platforms are doing.



And finally, I sense from some of the discussions an anti SL/LL tone the
same way there has been an anti Microsoft tone in so many Open Source
projects in the past. So many good Open Source projects have been wasted
away in the past because they concentrated fighting the &quot;big evil&quot; instead
of writing code that was great and made sense. There is absolutely no point
diverting OpenSim from Second Life for just sake of it, because we feel now
that OpenSim is great enough product and we can do it all ourselves.
However, if we find that keeping the compatibility is going to stop us
realising some great things in the future then that is a different matter,
but even then each case should be considered carefully.



Regards,



Olli

Hi:

Morgaine, I agree with you except:

*       SL is based on highly centralized concepts of identity, storage and
control, which come together to create either a walled garden or a prison
planet, depending on one's perspective.  Whatever one's worldview, the end
result is badly non-scalable in those three areas.  SL suffers hugely from
that non-scalability despite the relatively small size of the service at
this early stage.  Opensim needs decentralized / distributed mechanisms for
identity, storage and control if it is to scale for Internet-wide adoption.


How can I trust anyone who hasn't been authorized through a well known
trusting system? Well, if you mean systems like OpenID, forget my comments.
If not, can you explain that?

About the topic...

Except with the lack of huge, updated and good documentation, and having
into account that there are no money incomes (no business angels out of
here)... it's a miracle for the project to be still alive :-)

No complaints about opensim, no opinions about Blue Mars and the rest...
