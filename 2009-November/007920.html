<PRE>Adam,

You hit the nail right on his head with this passage:

*The big problem here is there&#8217;s a very real lack of viewer developers in
this community &#8211; there is some overlap between server &amp; network engineers
(like the OS community) and 3D Viewer Developers here, but not much. If we
do have 3D devs in the community who haven&#8217;t done anything and feel like
contributing &#8211; you really should be talking to some of the &#8216;next gen viewer&#8217;
 projects and seeing if we can get something awesome done faster.
*
And maybe someone should explain WHY people won't burn their hands on the
viewer

Main reason: There's a clausule on the Website and internally about &quot;*Look
at viewer code, and there's 6 months no working on OpenSim&quot;*

So any person that would like to keep working on OpenSim doesn't look at
viewer code, and vice versa.

That's about the main reason that some viewer developers won't co-operate
with OpenSim and the other way, developers from OpenSim can't help viewer
developers

But that's just my 2 cents about that passage.
