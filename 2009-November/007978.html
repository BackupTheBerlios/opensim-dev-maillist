I was pretty excited to see the project SCM move to git. There is the
potential to have explosive development growth and innovation.

&gt;<i> The recent thread about &quot;Leaving Opensim&quot; highlights that not everyone has

</I>&gt;<i> While it's true that the Opensim Core group still operates partly as a
</I>&gt;<i> Cathedral (because they anoint *people* to join them, instead of picking
</I>&gt;<i> code contributions on the merits of the code), the project's SCM moved from
</I>&gt;<i> SVN to Git a little while ago, and this brings about a profound change.
</I>&gt;<i> It's not merely a different SCM tool, but a change from centralized to
</I>&gt;<i> distributed code management, and this brings Opensim almost entirely into
</I>&gt;<i> the Bazaar model.  (Non-programmers may want to see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/&lt;http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/&lt;http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> if this is new.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With Git, everyone's repository for the project has equal standing, and
</I>&gt;<i> anyone can clone their own repository, make changes, and advertise their
</I>&gt;<i> improvements.  Approval by the Core team is not required, and nothing
</I>&gt;<i> important distinguishes Opensim Core's own repository from any other.  The
</I>&gt;<i> system is truly distributed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a result, there is no need for anyone to &quot;leave Opensim&quot; owing to
</I>&gt;<i> divergence of views or direction.  Just clone your own repo and let people
</I>&gt;<i> know about it.  If your contributions are useful, people will merge your
</I>&gt;<i> changes into their own clones of the Core repo, or will follow your branch,
</I>&gt;<i> or will clone your own repo wholesale.  It's like old-fashioned forking but
</I>&gt;<i> without the hassles of forking, and with much reduced chasing of tail
</I>&gt;<i> lights. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In time, I expect that the Opensim Core developer group will be replaced by
</I>&gt;<i> a Steering Group, perhaps once version 1.0 has been reached and a public
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim Foundation has been created.  The steering group could select and
</I>&gt;<i> test well-regarded public contributions from a large number of community
</I>&gt;<i> developer Git repositories, picked on the basis of consistency and community
</I>&gt;<i> needs.  Then the Bazaar will truly have arrived.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But we're almost there anyway, because the tools already allow it.  There
</I>&gt;<i> is no need to leave, just join the Git bazaar. :-)
