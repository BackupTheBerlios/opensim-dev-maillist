&gt;<i> Wow everyone.  I should take afternoon naps more often.  I've slept  
</I>&gt;<i> and rested, and read all the replies that have filtered down since  
</I>&gt;<i> my first &quot;outburst&quot; this morning and I would gladly be willing to  
</I>&gt;<i> assist in any proper way that I can.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Kyle said, so kindly, it is far more fruitful if we work  
</I>&gt;<i> together, but as others have said - a willingness to help without  
</I>&gt;<i> knowing just where or how to begin is just as fruitless as no help  
</I>&gt;<i> at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would love to have the opportunity to collaborate on a way to  
</I>&gt;<i> develop a straightforward and simplistic compile-install-administer  
</I>&gt;<i> wiki that we can all work on, tweak, proof, rearrange, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a brief background, I have years of past experience in basic  
</I>&gt;<i> programming, html/css web design and current very thorough  
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of MySQL/WordPress/MediaWiki/etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, last week I re-activated domain names I've owned for many  
</I>&gt;<i> years that all route to the core domain www.lenfocenter.com - &quot;The  
</I>&gt;<i> Lenformation Center&quot; - ha!, back when I was a bright eye'd graduate  
</I>&gt;<i> student I thought Lenformation - all there was to know about me  
</I>&gt;<i> (Len) - was such a cool idea.  Currenty it just says &quot;coming soon.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been planning to use the domain more as a means of relaying  
</I>&gt;<i> specific topics of interest to me, and hoped when re-activating the  
</I>&gt;<i> domain recently that I'd further the development of the &quot;Portable  
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim Platform&quot; I had invested a lot of time in earlier this year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BUT, in agreement with others - if we can collaborate and converse,  
</I>&gt;<i> I would be happy to offer anything I can with the resources I have,  
</I>&gt;<i> as I'm sure others would too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And on the side, if there is a need for any additional temporary  
</I>&gt;<i> forums, wiki's, etc - my domain is hosted on a very reliable and  
</I>&gt;<i> high-throughput backbone and I have dedicated access to implement up  
</I>&gt;<i> to two high-use MySQL databases.  Again, should the need or desire  
</I>&gt;<i> arise, that is what I have to offer by way of resources.  I can also  
</I>&gt;<i> secure a domain for additional use at any time (takes effect within  
</I>&gt;<i> 1 to 2 hours 24/7).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, my chief interest would be in documentation, writing  
</I>&gt;<i> step-by-step procedures, and so forth.  I'm also good with taking  
</I>&gt;<i> and editing screen-shots and assembling step-wise procedures for  
</I>&gt;<i> following along - that are print-ready.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to contact me via email and briefly familiarize me with  
</I>&gt;<i> any other means of communication - IRC, IM, etc.  I use Pigeon and  
</I>&gt;<i> have access to Yahoo IM, MSN (Hotmail) IM, Google/gMail Chat, and  
</I>&gt;<i> ICQ, but could accommodate another means if necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just let me know and I'll be ready to take part.
</I>&gt;<i>
