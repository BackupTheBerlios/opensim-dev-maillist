<PRE>Sorry that it didn't work out for you. Good luck with whatever other  
platform you choose.
This is a mailing list for discussing technical issues, so please take  
the personal drama elsewhere. All personal dramas generate interest,  
but that doesn't mean that they're appropriate for this mailing list.

I have created a forum that people can use to communicate feelings,  
and exchange stories about their explorations in opensim and beyond:
<A HREF="http://opensim.freeforums.org/">http://opensim.freeforums.org/</A>
Please take this thread there or elsewhere.
Thanks.

</I>&gt;<i> The 3rd draft of the OpenSim User Manual I posted 29th Jan this year  
</I>&gt;<i> (unfortunately, despite a team being created, no-one added to it);  
</I>&gt;<i> my last Opensim tutorial I posted in Aug 2009 (Streaming Audio); I  
</I>&gt;<i> made blog posts about Opensim as recently as Sep and October, and  
</I>&gt;<i> posted in the SLU forum on Opensim on the 11th Nov; and throughout  
</I>&gt;<i> this year I have been answering questions on all the tutorials both  
</I>&gt;<i> on the tutorials pages and in SL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I must admit that I was impressed as hell with Blue Mars when it  
</I>&gt;<i> came out, and have written on that almost as extensively as I have  
</I>&gt;<i> on Opensim. I have never considered Blue Mars to be a competitor in  
</I>&gt;<i> any way to Opensim (there is no standalone version of Blue Mars, it  
</I>&gt;<i> is purely a Linden-like commercial platform, and hence there is no  
</I>&gt;<i> question of marketing it to an opensource community such as  
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim), but I do consider it to be a competitor (when and if it is  
</I>&gt;<i> released) to Second Life. However, the UDK can be a competitor to  
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim (to be confirmed, tests ongoing), as it is available in  
</I>&gt;<i> server/client mode, and sandboxes have already been made. However,  
</I>&gt;<i> to ignore what I have also done for Opensim this year is a little  
</I>&gt;<i> unfair.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still run my Opensim (using r.7302 !! , IMHO the most stable  
</I>&gt;<i> release ever made), and I will continue to answer questions about  
</I>&gt;<i> the tutorials until someone else takes them over (but I will be  
</I>&gt;<i> really surprised if anyone does come forward to take them over), or  
</I>&gt;<i> they become obsolete.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could have just faded away, but I thought others might be  
</I>&gt;<i> interested in my reasons for finally calling it a day for Opensim  
</I>&gt;<i> (which I think is better than simply saying nothing), and indeed it  
</I>&gt;<i> does seem to have generated some debate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said before, I do wish all the team all the very best of luck,  
</I>&gt;<i> and my good wishes go out for the future of Opensim.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Colin, i have not seen you on this project in like a year or more,  
</I>&gt;<i> this seems like nothing more than an attempt by you to market Blue  
</I>&gt;<i> Mars to this group..  You have done nothing but talk about blue mars  
</I>&gt;<i> for as long as I can remember now.. as far as I am concerned you  
</I>&gt;<i> left this project about a year ago.. You have not contributed  
</I>&gt;<i> anything to this project in at least that long..
