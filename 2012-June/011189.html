I'm somewhat interested in vehicle scripting as some of the issues may be 
related to other movement related issues I have when I try to make some 
fireworks. It would also be good to have fixed so I could use my flying 
sleigh at Christmas time. :-)

I have a fireworks script from SL. It seems to be almost working. The 
problem I see is that when the main script tries to launch the firework 
projectile, the vertical velocity requested in the llRezObject call is 
ignored. The projectile moves slightly in the X and Y directions a small 
amount (less than expected), then explodes. The lack of vertical motion 
sounds similar to the problem mentioned above with vehicle scripts.
