<PRE>Mike,

I guess that no one that deals with vehicles has taken a look at that 
code in a good while now. Since you have a handle on this from the LSL 
side, why don't you have a look at the OpenSim ODE code for that? I did 
look at it and it looks pretty straightforward. Maybe you can see 
something from that side.

d is Ode.NET which contains functions found here:

If you see something there, you can submit patches (or hit us with a 
clue stick) and we can get it fixed. It may be as simple as calling 
d.BodyGetRotation and plugging the result into the equation:

Thanks!
