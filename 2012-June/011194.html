<PRE>let me remind you OpenSim is not SL.. as such start with a fresh script 
using X and ODE.
over the past years I have seen most vehicle types duplicated by the vehicle 
creators with and without the vehicle functions.
to call the difference a bug is not addressing the solutions.

good luck

I'm somewhat interested in vehicle scripting as some of the issues may be
related to other movement related issues I have when I try to make some
fireworks. It would also be good to have fixed so I could use my flying
sleigh at Christmas time. :-)

I have a fireworks script from SL. It seems to be almost working. The
problem I see is that when the main script tries to launch the firework
projectile, the vertical velocity requested in the llRezObject call is
ignored. The projectile moves slightly in the X and Y directions a small
amount (less than expected), then explodes. The lack of vertical motion
sounds similar to the problem mentioned above with vehicle scripts.
