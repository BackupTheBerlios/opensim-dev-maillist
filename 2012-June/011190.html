<PRE>I have been experimenting with trains in SL and would like to make a 
physical one that works in OpenSim. Hopefully these cases aren't some 
limitation of the physics engines and can have a proper fix.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=6040">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=6040</A>&gt; for starters. Instead
</I>&gt;<i> of submitting 1000 line vehicle scripts that do not work, I am writing
</I>&gt;<i> small 10-line scripts that demonstrate a particular problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Issue 0006040 &lt;<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=6040">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=6040</A>&gt; is
</I>&gt;<i> particularly interesting because if my hypothesis is correct, the linear
</I>&gt;<i> motor direction is being actively projected onto the global XY plane. I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot get an airplane to glide up, or a balloon to rise using the
</I>&gt;<i> linear motor. (Hover height works with balloons, but not the linear
</I>&gt;<i> motor even with hover height disabled). The interesting thing about this
</I>&gt;<i> is that my hypothesis suggests that there is extra code doing this
</I>&gt;<i> projection onto the XY plane. I checked the vehicle flags and there
</I>&gt;<i> isn't one that should force this extra projection into the calculations.
</I>&gt;<i> Vehicle type balloon is supposed to have all the flags removed, but just
</I>&gt;<i> to be sure I used the remove call to clear them all. The linear motor
</I>&gt;<i> still cannot go up. Can someone familiar with the code look at the
</I>&gt;<i> linear motor and tell me why this is happening and if there is a way to
</I>&gt;<i> disable it? (I tried turning flags like VEHICLE_FLAG_NO_DEFLECTION_UP on
</I>&gt;<i> to see if this flag was inverted, and if it applied to the motor instead
</I>&gt;<i> of deflection, but no luck).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fun thing is that I can write one kind of vehicle that works well --
</I>&gt;<i> assuming this bug is there. I built a vehicle that has the linear motor
</I>&gt;<i> set to &lt;0,0,20&gt;, pointing straight up. When the vehicle is perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal, the projection of this motor onto XY is &lt;0,0,0&gt; and the
</I>&gt;<i> vehicle does nothing. But then when you tilt the vehicle in any
</I>&gt;<i> direction, the projection of the linear motor on XY becomes non-zero and
</I>&gt;<i> causes it to start moving in the direction of tilt. This feels a lot
</I>&gt;<i> like an RL helicopter, so I used the control keys to pitch down/up to
</I>&gt;<i> move forward/backwards, added yaw left and right, and used page-up/down
</I>&gt;<i> to increase/decrease the hover height. I put it in a hacked together
</I>&gt;<i> helicopter build and it is a lot of fun!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm looking for work-arounds for the current vehicle routine behaviors.
</I>&gt;<i> One work-around for an airplane is to turn on hover height, check the
</I>&gt;<i> airplane speed and pitch once a second in timer(), calculate what
</I>&gt;<i> altitude the plane should get to in the next second, and set hover
</I>&gt;<i> height to that altitude. The things we do to get stuff working!
</I>&gt;<i>
