<PRE>If anyone needs the expertise,   I was a math and physics major in 
college, am comfortable with various transformations, and can sometimes 
provide clues as to how to tackle certain situations -- provided there 
are stable tools that do something, anything,  consistently.    After an 
initial exploration of vehicle and similar physics in OpenSim and 
SecondLife,   and finding behaviors that were not only bizarre, but 
unreproducible, or seemed to change by the hour and day,  I just gave up 
working on that.

Still, I'm a private pilot and still have all my calculus and mechanics 
books and can help with vector or matrix algebra and that sort of 
thing.   Email me if you have a math / physics question I might be able 
to help with, regarding how ACTUAL objects behave in REALISTIC 
worlds.    I can't help on why script commands don't do what they 
should, if you can even figure out what it was they were hoping to do in 
the first place.

Wade / &quot;Starlight Harbour&quot;  in Jokaydia, OSgrid, Kitely, Unity, and 
Second Life.

&gt;<i> I've been working with vehicle scripting on opensims now for over 4 
</I>&gt;<i> years. There are lots of historical scripts I have written or adapted 
</I>&gt;<i> from the work of others, or collaborated on with others in the OSgrid 
</I>&gt;<i> scripting forums. These include sailing scripts, automobile scripts, 
</I>&gt;<i> and yes, even a helicopter script. Dave Coyle said over three years 
</I>&gt;<i> ago that my helicopter was &quot;the most satisfying vehicle he'd ever seen 
</I>&gt;<i> on an opensim'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, Owen Oyen and I produced the first vehicles on OSgrid 
</I>&gt;<i> *without any vehicle functions at all*. These were sailboats that 
</I>&gt;<i> entirely simulated 'sailboat physics' using llSetRot, llGetRot, 
</I>&gt;<i> llApplyImpulse and friends. The boat was clunky, did not heel, moved 
</I>&gt;<i> in anything but a smooth fashion, and was hell on the simulation. My 
</I>&gt;<i> more 'modern' boats can be found on Littlefield region on OSgrid, as 
</I>&gt;<i> well as a historical display documenting the work on the aquavita. The 
</I>&gt;<i> working copies of the boats are in a vendor; those sitting at the dock 
</I>&gt;<i> have had the scripts ripped out to reduce lag on the sim, don't take 
</I>&gt;<i> copies of those.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Later (much later than that boat, the 'Aquavita&quot;), I worked 
</I>&gt;<i> extensively with Kitto Flora to get ODE implemetations of such vehicle 
</I>&gt;<i> scripting functions working as  work now. The work is imperfect, but 
</I>&gt;<i> not all of the problems are with ODE proper; some have to do with 
</I>&gt;<i> various math functions' implementation in opensim, and how they differ 
</I>&gt;<i> from the same math functions as implemented in SL under havoc. The 
</I>&gt;<i> short story is, LL's functions are broken in terms of how physics 
</I>&gt;<i> actually dictates real-world objects behave; and the same functions 
</I>&gt;<i> are incomplete here, as the developers who worked on them refused to 
</I>&gt;<i> implement the broken math, and no resolution could be reached among 
</I>&gt;<i> the devs as to how to proceed, so the functions on opensims are 
</I>&gt;<i> incomplete and/or unfinished.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of this is more or less ancient history. I've got many very simple 
</I>&gt;<i> test objects needed to reproduce these errors as test cases in 
</I>&gt;<i> inventory on the grid, and related mantis entries filed, but quite 
</I>&gt;<i> frankly they've been ignored for so long I lost interest a couple 
</I>&gt;<i> years back and haven't really bothered with vehicles since. Who wants 
</I>&gt;<i> to sail a boat that doesn't heel? Who want's to fly an airplane that 
</I>&gt;<i> has no inertia if a vector component is on the z-axis? Not to mention, 
</I>&gt;<i> incoming physics 'fixes' often break the workarounds, with no 
</I>&gt;<i> explanation of how to take advantage of the improvements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's really discouraging to be told about your now non-functional 
</I>&gt;<i> helicopter you've been using for most of a year that 'those vehicle 
</I>&gt;<i> functions never really worked anyway'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the problems is that to make something work you have to be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to define 'working' in a manner that lends itself to implementation by 
</I>&gt;<i> nuts and bolts coders, and (so far) no one has presented themselves 
</I>&gt;<i> that has that sort of exhaustive knowledge of LL's vehicle physics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not a nay-sayer; I really hope this stuff can be made to work 
</I>&gt;<i> someday; but I long ago lost hope as I'll likely be dead and buried 
</I>&gt;<i> before it happens at current rates of development, especially if 
</I>&gt;<i> everyone forgets or ignores all the prior work that has been done or 
</I>&gt;<i> that the issues raised are not so new as the users encountering them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm available to help with this, as much or as little as is needed, 
</I>&gt;<i> but you'll have to be patient with me as, at this point, I've largely 
</I>&gt;<i> forgotten a lot of what I knew about this, having given up on going 
</I>&gt;<i> blue in the face trying to get anyone to take notice of the issues I 
</I>&gt;<i> was raising.

</I>&gt;<i>     I think it would be a good thing to collect all the relevant
