</I>I know that OpenSim is not Sl, I am starting with fresh scripts. I would 
love to talk to someone who has made an airplane work. Did they find a 
way to disable the squashing of the Z component of the linear motor? Did 
they do the hack I suggested of using hover height to replace the 
missing linear motor Z values? And when the airplane pitches or rolls, 
the local Z axis decouples from the region Z axis and the angular motor 
should start acting strange. Did they discover that the angular motor 
vector must be multiplied by llGetRot() like I did? And why didn't they 
document this for the next guy?
