I don't find a lot of scripts need massive rewrites. I've brought a lot of 
scripts over from SL to OS. Sometimes I have to deal with poorly written 
scripts, sometimes I clean them up to reduce possible sources of lag (ie. 
reducing their runtime), and sometimes it is to eliminate SLisms in the 
code. For scripts I also use in SL I have often done some initial cleanup 
(dealing with the first two issues) before the script makes it so an OS grid.

The flying sleigh might need a new script but I haven't looked at it in 
detail for some time. The firework script is very simple and it comes down 
to one line to &quot;fire&quot; the projectile. Hard to get much simpler than that.

Kevin.
