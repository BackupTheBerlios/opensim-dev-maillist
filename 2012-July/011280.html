  The implementation of NPCs are causing the deviations from SL while 
all my scripts are based on the SL definitions and also run 1:1 in SL. 
If there would be a possebility to solve this issue, I also would 
redesign my application, but sofar I havnt found any relyable method for 
NPC detection other than llDetectedType returning NPC even when using 
OS_NPC_SENCE_AS_AGENT. Even in our Opensim code we find the name changes 
for hg visitors implemented as detection with the deffrence that NPC are 
excluded via the opensim code.

This is also a problem for others, it not only me who is having issues 
with NPC detection.

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I have a problem with the way that NPCs might be implemented in
</I>&gt;<i>     llDetectedType. A patch can be found in Mantis 6066.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      In the events touch, collision and sensor one can use the
</I>&gt;<i>     function llDetectedType which return some basic infos on what type
</I>&gt;<i>     of object/agent... has been detected by the event. To complete
</I>&gt;<i>     this function, we still need to add NPCs as type. Sofar, so good...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      NPC do however also have the possebility to be created using
</I>&gt;<i>     OS_NPC_SENCE_AS_AGENT. This was implemented sothat NPCs would work
</I>&gt;<i>     with sensor events ( without changing the lsl script). At that
</I>&gt;<i>     time NPCs were not implemented to llDetectedType which one could
</I>&gt;<i>     have easely used to change the lsl script to work with NPCs and/OR
</I>&gt;<i>     agents instead of implementing OS_NPC_SENCE_AS_AGENT. The result
</I>&gt;<i>     is, that using OS_NPC_SENCE_AS_AGENT would return an agent when
</I>&gt;<i>     using llDetected AND that there is NO way to know if the event was
</I>&gt;<i>     triggered by an agent or NPC without forcing the users to enable
</I>&gt;<i>     osIsNPC for everybody,  and I do realy mean everybody. For me and
</I>&gt;<i>     some other projects I know of, this will have fatal sideeffects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Let look at our 3 avatar type, normal agent, liblibomv bot and
</I>&gt;<i>     NPC's and how these can be used for identification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Situation 1) A closed grid with hypergrid disabled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Normal agent = registered at grid, unique uuid + name within
</I>&gt;<i>     grid, controled by human
</I>&gt;<i>     - Bots = basicaly same as agent, registered at grid,  with unique
</I>&gt;<i>     uuid + name within grid, but remotly controled by software
</I>&gt;<i>     - NPC = NOT registered, unique uuid within grid, ANY fictional OR
</I>&gt;<i>     existing name possible and like bots remotly controled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     If llDetectedType return agent for NPCs using OS_NPC_SENSE_AGENT
</I>&gt;<i>     we only could detect the NPC using llRequestAgentData to see if we
</I>&gt;<i>     get a posetive respone via DATA_NAME (unless the region itself
</I>&gt;<i>     detects the online NPC as agent and returns the NPC data, havnt
</I>&gt;<i>     tested that yet.) In any case, the uuid remains unique and can
</I>&gt;<i>     always be used to identify a single agent/npc/bot
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Situation 2) Multigrid system with hypergrid enabled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Normal agent = registered at grid, unique uuid + name within
</I>&gt;<i>     grid, controled by human, surname changes with hypergrid, name
</I>&gt;<i>     supplies griddata on hypergrid travels
</I>&gt;<i>     - Bots = basicaly same as agent, registered at grid,  with unique
</I>&gt;<i>     uuid + name within grid, but remotly controled by software,
</I>&gt;<i>     surname changes with hypergrid, name supplies griddata on
</I>&gt;<i>     hypergrid travels
</I>&gt;<i>     - NPC = NOT registered, unique uuid within grid, ANY fictional OR
</I>&gt;<i>     existing name possible and like bots remotly controled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      The uuid - name relation is still unique WITHIN a grid, but the
</I>&gt;<i>     same uuid-name relationship can be used in multiple grids by
</I>&gt;<i>     DIFFRENT users. However when hypergrid traveling the name changes
</I>&gt;<i>     and one can extract the agents origin grid sothat one recieves a
</I>&gt;<i>     unique uuid+name+grid relationship. In a multigrid system were
</I>&gt;<i>     llDetectedType return agent for NPCs using OS_NPC_SENSE_AGENT
</I>&gt;<i>     there is NO method using plain lsl to get the unique
</I>&gt;<i>     uuid+name+grid relationship,  llRequestAgentData is not available
</I>&gt;<i>     in all grids from the hypergrid visitor. The names of NPCs are NOT
</I>&gt;<i>     unique within a grid AND the uuid could already exist in another
</I>&gt;<i>     grid for an agent. The uuid alone CAN'T be used to identify a
</I>&gt;<i>     single agent/bot/npc in a multi grid system which is hypergrid
</I>&gt;<i>     enabled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Short summary: In a mutligrid system with hypergrid each
</I>&gt;<i>     agent/bot has a unique uuid - name - grid relationship were 2
</I>&gt;<i>     elements are needed for identification, in a single grid without
</I>&gt;<i>     hypergrid the uuid is enough to identify each agent/bot/npc. In a
</I>&gt;<i>     multigrid system NPC have to be identified as NPC sothat one can
</I>&gt;<i>     identify the NPC using uuid + grid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     As mentioned there is no plain lsl method for identification in a
</I>&gt;<i>     multiple grid system with hypergrid if llDetectedType returns an
</I>&gt;<i>     Agent for NPCs using OS_NPC_SENSE_AGENT. In Opensim we do have
</I>&gt;<i>     OSSL function which could be used to help to distinguish between a
</I>&gt;<i>     registered agent and a NPC, eg. osIsNPC. The problem is however,
</I>&gt;<i>     that a multigrid system would have to have multiple scripts
</I>&gt;<i>     available for all sorts of ossl combinations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     a) No NPCs allowed for anyone - script does not need any NPCs and
</I>&gt;<i>     all event can only be triggered by agents.
</I>&gt;<i>     b) NPCs allowed  for 1 or more users, osIsNPC not enabled - Our
</I>&gt;<i>     script CAN'T recognize an NPC, so the service has to be excluded
</I>&gt;<i>     and may not be used on that region
</I>&gt;<i>     c) NPC allowed for 1 or more users, osIsNPC enabled for those
</I>&gt;<i>     users - Our script CAN'T recognize an NPC if the script is owned
</I>&gt;<i>     by someone not enabled to use osIsNPC, so the service has to be
</I>&gt;<i>     excluded and may not be used on that region.
</I>&gt;<i>     d) NPC allowed for 1 or more users, osIsNPC enabled for everyone -
</I>&gt;<i>     Our script can now use osIsNPC nowmatter who the owner is, only
</I>&gt;<i>     now we can recognize NPCs
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So if your offering a multigrid service, were we need 2 elements
</I>&gt;<i>     for identification, it is required to have atleast 2 script. 1
</I>&gt;<i>     script for regions were noone can use NPCs and another were
</I>&gt;<i>     osIsNPC is enabled for everyone. This means that atleast 2 scripts
</I>&gt;<i>     need to be maintained by the scriptor and a huge support team
</I>&gt;<i>     which has to personaly speak to each customer to explain what
</I>&gt;<i>     script to use etc etc. Latest after 1 year the customer has
</I>&gt;<i>     forgotten everything and changes the NPC settings, which messes up
</I>&gt;<i>     the agent identification or the region owner changes something
</I>&gt;<i>     without notifying the parcelwoners because he himself only wants
</I>&gt;<i>     to try something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Now if the script is in a hud, then we never know what region
</I>&gt;<i>     settings are configured on the region we visit. So as we dont know
</I>&gt;<i>     anything about the settings, our entire uuid+name+grid relation is
</I>&gt;<i>     useless and we have NO method atall for identification in a
</I>&gt;<i>     multigrid system with hypergrid enabled. All ossl that could be
</I>&gt;<i>     used for NPC detection must be considered not avialble while NPC
</I>&gt;<i>     can be used by others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     One could create extra modules to help us, but latest if a closed
</I>&gt;<i>     grid is involved we are not able to run our additional module. So
</I>&gt;<i>     thats also not an option.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     R&#233;sum&#233;: The only method that would help in a multigrid system is,
</I>&gt;<i>     if llDetectedType ALWAYS returns NPC nomatter what settings is
</I>&gt;<i>     used and AGENT for any agent/bot. Enabling OS_NPC_SENSE_AGENT to
</I>&gt;<i>     alow llDetectedType to return agent makes all 3rd party systems in
</I>&gt;<i>     a multigrid hypergrid enabled enviroment virtualy impossible to
</I>&gt;<i>     handle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It was thus also my intention to get this issue solved prior to
</I>&gt;<i>     implementation of osNPCTouch, but for that it is to late now
</I>&gt;<i>     anyway :(.
