</I>&gt;<i> calculate the force of gravity, the counteracting force of buoyancy, and calculate a force that would result in the
</I>&gt;<i> linear velocity. Sum all the forces into one and apply them to the object. But I don't think the physics is done in a
</I>&gt;<i> manner that &quot;realistic&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>      What is SUPPOSED to happen when gravity and the linear motor are combined? Seeing as the linear motor specifies the
</I>&gt;<i> end velocity, it should overpower (ignore) gravity. What happens in SL when you turn on the linear motor on a falling
</I>&gt;<i> object? I suspect that it simply turns in the linear motor direction. Hopefully making a smooth turn in the decay time.
</I>&gt;<i> I'll have to go do physics experiments in SL to figure out what they implimented.

</I>&gt;<i> time (see my first comment above) I could get more involved with that..

That would be very welcome.  As always, time is the constraint for many of us as well, as are the many other bugs and 
issues that OpenSimulator has :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nice catch, Mike. Have you had time to investigate this any further?
