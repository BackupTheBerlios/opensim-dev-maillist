<PRE>Hi.

  I have a problem with the way that NPCs might be implemented in 
llDetectedType. A patch can be found in Mantis 6066.

  In the events touch, collision and sensor one can use the function 
llDetectedType which return some basic infos on what type of 
object/agent... has been detected by the event. To complete this 
function, we still need to add NPCs as type. Sofar, so good...

  NPC do however also have the possebility to be created using 
OS_NPC_SENCE_AS_AGENT. This was implemented sothat NPCs would work with 
sensor events ( without changing the lsl script). At that time NPCs were 
not implemented to llDetectedType which one could have easely used to 
change the lsl script to work with NPCs and/OR agents instead of 
implementing OS_NPC_SENCE_AS_AGENT. The result is, that using 
OS_NPC_SENCE_AS_AGENT would return an agent when using llDetected AND 
that there is NO way to know if the event was triggered by an agent or 
NPC without forcing the users to enable osIsNPC for everybody,  and I do 
realy mean everybody. For me and some other projects I know of, this 
will have fatal sideeffects.



   Let look at our 3 avatar type, normal agent, liblibomv bot and NPC's 
and how these can be used for identification.

Situation 1) A closed grid with hypergrid disabled.

- Normal agent = registered at grid, unique uuid + name within grid, 
controled by human
- Bots = basicaly same as agent, registered at grid,  with unique uuid + 
name within grid, but remotly controled by software
- NPC = NOT registered, unique uuid within grid, ANY fictional OR 
existing name possible and like bots remotly controled.

If llDetectedType return agent for NPCs using OS_NPC_SENSE_AGENT we only 
could detect the NPC using llRequestAgentData to see if we get a 
posetive respone via DATA_NAME (unless the region itself detects the 
online NPC as agent and returns the NPC data, havnt tested that yet.) In 
any case, the uuid remains unique and can always be used to identify a 
single agent/npc/bot

Situation 2) Multigrid system with hypergrid enabled.

- Normal agent = registered at grid, unique uuid + name within grid, 
controled by human, surname changes with hypergrid, name supplies 
griddata on hypergrid travels
- Bots = basicaly same as agent, registered at grid,  with unique uuid + 
name within grid, but remotly controled by software, surname changes 
with hypergrid, name supplies griddata on hypergrid travels
- NPC = NOT registered, unique uuid within grid, ANY fictional OR 
existing name possible and like bots remotly controled.

  The uuid - name relation is still unique WITHIN a grid, but the same 
uuid-name relationship can be used in multiple grids by DIFFRENT users. 
However when hypergrid traveling the name changes and one can extract 
the agents origin grid sothat one recieves a unique uuid+name+grid 
relationship. In a multigrid system were llDetectedType return agent for 
NPCs using OS_NPC_SENSE_AGENT there is NO method using plain lsl to get 
the unique uuid+name+grid relationship,  llRequestAgentData is not 
available in all grids from the hypergrid visitor. The names of NPCs are 
NOT unique within a grid AND the uuid could already exist in another 
grid for an agent. The uuid alone CAN'T be used to identify a single 
agent/bot/npc in a multi grid system which is hypergrid enabled.

  Short summary: In a mutligrid system with hypergrid each agent/bot has 
a unique uuid - name - grid relationship were 2 elements are needed for 
identification, in a single grid without hypergrid the uuid is enough to 
identify each agent/bot/npc. In a multigrid system NPC have to be 
identified as NPC sothat one can identify the NPC using uuid + grid.



As mentioned there is no plain lsl method for identification in a 
multiple grid system with hypergrid if llDetectedType returns an Agent 
for NPCs using OS_NPC_SENSE_AGENT. In Opensim we do have OSSL function 
which could be used to help to distinguish between a registered agent 
and a NPC, eg. osIsNPC. The problem is however, that a multigrid system 
would have to have multiple scripts available for all sorts of ossl 
combinations.

a) No NPCs allowed for anyone - script does not need any NPCs and all 
event can only be triggered by agents.
b) NPCs allowed  for 1 or more users, osIsNPC not enabled - Our script 
CAN'T recognize an NPC, so the service has to be excluded and may not be 
used on that region
c) NPC allowed for 1 or more users, osIsNPC enabled for those users - 
Our script CAN'T recognize an NPC if the script is owned by someone not 
enabled to use osIsNPC, so the service has to be excluded and may not be 
used on that region.
d) NPC allowed for 1 or more users, osIsNPC enabled for everyone - Our 
script can now use osIsNPC nowmatter who the owner is, only now we can 
recognize NPCs

So if your offering a multigrid service, were we need 2 elements for 
identification, it is required to have atleast 2 script. 1 script for 
regions were noone can use NPCs and another were osIsNPC is enabled for 
everyone. This means that atleast 2 scripts need to be maintained by the 
scriptor and a huge support team which has to personaly speak to each 
customer to explain what script to use etc etc. Latest after 1 year the 
customer has forgotten everything and changes the NPC settings, which 
messes up the agent identification or the region owner changes something 
without notifying the parcelwoners because he himself only wants to try 
something.

  Now if the script is in a hud, then we never know what region settings 
are configured on the region we visit. So as we dont know anything about 
the settings, our entire uuid+name+grid relation is useless and we have 
NO method atall for identification in a multigrid system with hypergrid 
enabled. All ossl that could be used for NPC detection must be 
considered not avialble while NPC can be used by others.

One could create extra modules to help us, but latest if a closed grid 
is involved we are not able to run our additional module. So thats also 
not an option.


R&#233;sum&#233;: The only method that would help in a multigrid system is, if 
llDetectedType ALWAYS returns NPC nomatter what settings is used and 
AGENT for any agent/bot. Enabling OS_NPC_SENSE_AGENT to alow 
llDetectedType to return agent makes all 3rd party systems in a 
multigrid hypergrid enabled enviroment virtualy impossible to handle.


It was thus also my intention to get this issue solved prior to 
implementation of osNPCTouch, but for that it is to late now anyway :(.
