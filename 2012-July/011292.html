<PRE>I am fully aware of the open source factor and that in each open grid 
everything can be changed, which is why one always needs backend 
function to make sure no fals information is passed on to the central 
service. One can however filter 99% of the fals data in the local sim 
which helps the central service because it does not need to process 
every single plausability checks. In a multi grid environment with 
closed grids we even have a lower chance of false data beeing passed 
than in a open grid only environment.

  We have the same situations in opensim were the simulator often does 
some local plausability checks before it send data to the gridservers. 
The gridservers again do a plausability check combined with other 
methods which are not available on the local sim. Only if all steps are 
plausable the data gets processed further.

Anyway, I added a new patch for llDetectedType were NPCs always return 
NPC and useing OS_NPC_SENSE_AS_AGENT will returns AGENT + NPC. I think 
that is an acceptable compromize... I also added an example script were 
the true NPC detection always makes sense  ;)

&gt;<i> Argus, if your system relies on always reliably identifying unique

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even if OS_NPC_SENSE_AS_AGENT did not exist, then people would be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to compile a version of the code that did have that functionality.  
</I>&gt;<i> This is not about ideology - it's about what is physically possible!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Equally, it is perfectly possible to create duplicate HG details - 
</I>&gt;<i> anything can be put in the agent data that comes from a foreign grid 
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">justin at hg.osgrid.org</A> or whatever).  You cannot rely on these to be 
</I>&gt;<i> unique either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Without any central authority (like DNS, the secure certificate 
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure of something like Bitcoin block chains) it is simply 
</I>&gt;<i> not possible to uniquely identify avatars.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see this as much different from the web where one has to get 
</I>&gt;<i> people to create unique accounts with passwords in order to identify 
</I>&gt;<i> them later.  Such a thing has to be done in some authority system 
</I>&gt;<i> outside of OpenSimulator itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If your point is that without OS_NPC_SENSE_AS_AGENT then the vast 
</I>&gt;<i> majority of systems would always present NPCs as NPCs (rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> agents) then I would agree.  In fact, in practice most people won't 
</I>&gt;<i> use OS_NPC_SENSE_AS_AGENT anyway as it's the option rather than the 
</I>&gt;<i> default.  But you cannot rely on uniquely identifying avatars on any 
</I>&gt;<i> environment outside those that you directly control.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a minor note, script functions that don't make any sense for NPCs 
</I>&gt;<i> should behave as if the UUID they received did not relate to a valid 
</I>&gt;<i> entity for that function.
</I>&gt;<i>
