<PRE>Yes, opensource also means nothing can be trusted 100% and that anyone 
can do whatever they want to fool the entire world. Most users do 
however want a running system for everyone, so those people will not 
deliberatly mess around, but thats all going off topic anyway.



Ok, Examples... I will go through some simple ones and increase the 
difficulty degree with each example....

Very basic scripts:
-----------------------

Example 1: Giver script
Very basic and common scripts are givers triggered by touch which also 
send a message to the owner to inform them that someone recieve an item. 
NPCs cant recieve items sent by llGiveInventory so we can exclude NPCs 
using llDetectedType and prevent the message also beeing sent.

Example 2: IM messengers
  All the offline/online IM messengers sont need to respond to touches 
via NPCs

Scripts that gather infos:
-----------------------

Example 3: Visitor lists
  All the visito lists that use sensor do not need to count NPCs which 
are using OS_NPC_SENSE_AS_AGENT

Example 4: Huds and other gimmics
  Some huds and other gimmics show who is near by, e.g. a hug animation 
gimmic. These normaly also do not need to show NPCs

Statistic scripts:
-----------------------

Example 5: Voting station
  Voting stations such as the one by oliveira in Osgrid count the unique 
touches to rank the places by popularity. NPCs definatly do not need to 
be counted. Due to the easy and fast  method of creating hundreds of 
unique NPCs the NPCs can be used to manipulate votes. Bots are much more 
complex to use and need to go through the grid registration. Comparing 
bots with NPCs, then bots will extremly rare tool for manipulations.

Multigrid systems in hypergrid.
-----------------------

Example 6:
  Now this is were the very complex situation starts with the multigrid 
and hypergrid stough. I will add sections A,B,C.. to make it easier in 
the discussions which will follow...

  I am going to extract a very &quot;basic&quot; part of one of my projects which 
includes a Rentbox and much more. I will add sections A,B,C.. to make it 
easier in the discussions which will follow... Giving script code 
example for this is not easy, so I will have to try to explain the 
prosedure a bit.

A)
  I am going to extract a very &quot;basic&quot; part of one of my projects which 
includes a Rentbox and many more inworld tools, all of which is 
connected to webtools for easy offline management etc etc.. One part of 
my rentbox is, that it offers the inworld dialog boxes in multiple 
languages. If a unknown avatar touches the rentbox, then the avatar can 
select a language via a dialog box. If the avatar is known and 
previously already selected a language, then the dialog box automaticaly 
selects the last chosen language which is saved on a webserver for that 
avatar. Sofar that should be clear

B)
The entire system is running in multiple grids, eg OSgrid, and these 
also include closed grids such as SL and GermanGrid. Some grids are 
hypergrid enabled and allow traveling between these grids.  As my system 
is hypergrid compatible, the last selected language is also automaticaly 
available in foreign grids. Lets say a hypergrid visitor from GermanGrid 
has selected german as language at a Rentbox in German grid, then they 
also will have a german dialog when touching a rentbox in osgrid.

C)
The automatic recognition of the last selected language requires that 
the avatar can uniquely be identified, otherwise it would mean that 
everyone needs to reselect the language every time they touch a rentbox. 
In a mutigrid hypergrid enabled enviroment without NPCs we have the 
following basic data stored:

Gridtable
+----------------------+--------------------------------+
|<i>   Gridname         |   hg last name of avatar |
</I>+----------------------+--------------------------------+
|<i>   OSGrid             |   hg.osgrid.org                |
</I>|<i>   GermanGrid     |   login.germangrid.de    |
</I>+----------------------+--------------------------------+

Avatar language table
+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
|<i>  id  |   Gridname         |   Avatar uuid    |   Avatar name | 
</I>language   |
+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
|<i>  1   |   OSgrid              |   uuid-1             |  Avatar 1       
</I>   |   en              |
|<i>  2   |   OSgrid              |   uuid-2             |  Avatar 2       
</I>   |   en              |
|<i>  3   |   GermanGrid     |   uuid-3             |  Avatar 3   |   de 
</I>              |
|<i>  4   |   GermanGrid     |   uuid-4             |  Avatar 4   |   
</I>en              |
|<i>  5   |   GermanGrid     |   uuid-5             |  Avatar 5   |   
</I>en              |
|<i>  6   |   OSgrid              |   uuid-3             |  Avatar 6       
</I>   |   de              |
|<i>  7   |   OSgrid              |   uuid-4             |  Avatar 4       
</I>   |   en              |
|<i>  8   |   OSgrid              |   uuid-6             |  Avatar 5       
</I>   |   de              |
+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+

D)
Now lets look at the avatars with the id's 7-9

Case id 7: the Avatar uuid &quot;uuid-3&quot; can exist in other grids, eg. 
GermanGrid id 3
Case id 8: The Avatar name &quot;Avatar 4&quot; can also exist in another grid, eg 
GermanGrid id 4
Case id 9: The Avatar uuid &quot;uuid-6&quot; AND Avatar name &quot;Avatar 5&quot; can also 
exist in another grid, eg GermanGrid id 6

Each avatar is however uniquely registered in each single grid and each 
uuid and each avatar name cannot be reused multiple times within each grid.

E)
Now lets asume our Rentbox is standing in OSgrid. If:

1) Avatar with &quot;uuid-1&quot; and &quot;Avatar 1&quot; touches the rentbox, we know its 
the avatar with id 1 which has english selected and its a local avatar 
from osgrid
2) Avatar with &quot;uuid-3&quot; and &quot;Avatar.3 @login.germangrid.de&quot; touches the 
rentbox, we know its the avatar with id 3 which has german selected and 
is a hypergird traveler from GermanGrid
3) Avatar with &quot;uuid-3&quot; and &quot;Avatar 6&quot; touches the rentbox, we know its 
the avatar with id 7 which has german selected. The uuid is not unique 
in all grids, but the name didnt change to a hypergrid name!
4) Avatar with &quot;uuid-7&quot; and &quot;Avatar 7&quot; touches the rentbox, this is a 
new avatar so we add it to our db and ask for the language
+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
|<i>  9   |   OSgrid              |   uuid-7            |    Avatar 7    
</I>      |   ?                |
+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+

So the name change from hypergrid visitors makes it possible to reliably 
identify the avatar eventhough the avatar uuid and/or avatar name is not 
unique in all grids. If one only searches by uuid or name, then multiple 
avatars would be returned.

F)
User friendly tools like a rentbox to offer functions to add Tendants by 
name were the uuid is not known. Based on the fact that avatars have a 
unique name and a unique uuid the identification via name + grid is 
possible in a mutigrid system. We might not always be able to add a new 
avatar with a uuid immidiatly e.g. due to script delays, but we can 
update that information

So now lets add a tendant with the avatar name &quot;Avatar 7&quot; from OSgrid. 
Lets also asume that the grid is very buizy and scripts are slow in 
getting the uuid so we addthe agent without a uuid for now. Remember, 
avatar uuid + names are unique, so what can go wrong?
+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
|<i>  9   |   OSgrid              |   ?                    | Avatar 7    
</I>      |   ?                |
+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+

G)
Now lets add NPCs to our table. NPC are currently imprisoned to the 
region of creation. Lets again take a rentbox in OSgrid which gets 
touched by a NPC.

1) we add NPC with NPC uuid &quot;uuid-7&quot; and NPC name &quot;NPC 1&quot;. The NPC name 
does not deliver any grid data, so the NPC is in the same grid as our 
rentbox= OSgrid.
+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
|<i>  10 |   OSgrid              |   uuid-7             |  NPC 1       |   
</I>?                |
+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
We added a new user, so please select the language before continuing...


2) we add NPC with NPC uuid &quot;uuid-8&quot; and Avatar name &quot;NPC.8 
@login.germangrid.de&quot;. The NPC name is a typical hypergrid name, so the 
NPC is from GermanGrid. Ups, a NPC currently cant teleport anywere, 
especialy not hypergrid.
+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
|<i>  11 |   GermanGrid     |   uuid-8             |  NPC 8   |   ?   
</I>              |
+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
We added a new user, so please select the language before continuing...


3) we add NPC with NPC uuid &quot;uuid-9&quot; and NPC name &quot;Avatar 1&quot;. The NPC 
name does not deliver any grid data, so the NPC is in the same grid as 
our rentbox= OSgrid. Ups, &quot;Avatar 1&quot; is already in use in OSgrid. Who is 
a NPC and who is a agent?
+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
|<i>  12 |   OSgrid              |   uuid-9             |  Avatar 1       
</I>|<i>   ?                |
</I>+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
We have 2 x &quot;Avatar 1&quot; in OSgrid, one with english selected (id 1), and 
another with no language selected (id12) As the uuid is unique, we asume 
its id 12, so please select the language... Unfortunatly as of now we 
cannot offer name based services for &quot;Avatar 1&quot; because we have 2 entries.


4) we add NPC with NPC uuid &quot;uuid-5&quot; and Avatar name &quot;Avatar.5 
@login.germangrid.de&quot;. The NPC name is a typical hypergrid name, so the 
NPC is from GermanGrid. We already know this avatar with the id 5. Big 
ups, we won the jackpot by having the same  uuid and name. While we are 
at it, how about we cancel the current lease...


5) we add NPC with NPC uuid &quot;uuid-10&quot; and Avatar name &quot;Avatar 7&quot;. The 
NPC name does not deliver any grid data, so the NPC is in the same grid 
as our rentbox= OSgrid. Great, we were faster than the script retrieving 
the uuid for &quot;Avatar 7&quot; in F, lets update it. Pitty &quot;Avatar 7&quot; with the 
id 9 actualy isnt a NPC
+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
|<i>  9   |   OSgrid              |   uuid-10          |    Avatar 7        
</I>|<i>   ?                |
</I>+----+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------------+
We added a new user, so please select the language before continuing...


H)
A Rentbox is much more complex then the language settings when touching. 
We have hovertext with names, owners functions, staf related functions, 
tendants, commisioning, addon modules, banning systems etc etc which all 
require a possetive identification.

I)
If lsl offers the possebility to detect an NPC as a NPC only, and agents 
as agents only, then one can atleast add the type to our avatar table in 
C or ignore NPCs.

  Due to hypergrid the scripts also can travel through hypergrid and 
land on other grids. Other grids or even regions might not be running on 
newer OS versions with all ossl/NPC functions/constants implemented so 
the scripts need to rely on the smalest available functionset.

  Up till  now lsl was &quot;dictated&quot; by LL and there was no possebility in 
OS to create exeptions from LL, not even adding true grid data to the 
header of http_requests. For me and other scripters in multiple grids 
the smalest reliable functionset thus always has been the lsl 
implemented functions in opensim were the script could be copied 1:1 to 
SL without changes. All scripts using OSSL or which require specific 
settings are good for the advanced users. Just imagine telling someone 
in SL using a hippo rentbox that one needs to do modifications to the 
sim and someone forgot to add a single function and everything broke, yippi

  NPCs are now the big exeption. It would be logical that SL scripts 
need to be changes to fully work with NPCs, but instead one changed the 
NPCs and lsl sothat  sl scripts work with NPCs while ignoring the 
diffrences between NPCs and Agents/Bots.


Hope that helps...
