<PRE>XInventory's data layer is consistent with all the other resources, it 
uses the generic table handler. That should eliminate the inventory 
crashes in SQLite in Mac, although I haven't had time to test this. (and 
it won't fix all other problems with SQLite in the Mac)
The network connectors are also much simpler and nicer than the old 
ones, same as as the new ones: form data + xml responses.

Migration: for MySql the tables are exactly the same, so there's no 
migration. For SQLite, the tables were inconsistent with the tables in 
MySql, so there are new ones. Migration is possible, and it's working, 
sorta. I have a migration there (002) that theoretically does it, but 
for some reason doesn't work inside OpenSim -- but it works if you type 
those exact statements in the sqlite3 console. Cause TBD.

I don't know what other data migration issues you are referring to. As 
far as I know, all migrations are there, and are working, both for MySql 
and SQLite.

Data migration is possible. I have a migration in there that 
theoretically does it, although, for some reason it doesn't work when 
it's run by the OpenSim migrations code

More details over IRC if you are there.
