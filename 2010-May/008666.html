<PRE>Aloha,

I have been using libomv/testclient based bots for months now, most recently
with 0.8.1.  In my experience, it is easy to control them using in-world
scripts.  I regularly start the testclient bot using the --scriptfile
command line option, using the designated script to define an in-world
object as the bots &quot;master&quot; (see SetMasterKey).  This allows me to use
llInstantMessage to send commands to the bots and control them.

However, recent releases of OpenSim seem to have changed the functionality
related to walking movement.  Specifically the &quot;autopilot&quot; function calls
that used to trigger a bot to walk to a specified location.  I haven't been
able to isolate the server side changes responsible.  My response was also
to design a scripted attachment  which I have programmed and tested.  When
attached to an avatar driven by a &quot;regular&quot; client, this attachment uses
llMoveToTarget and is successful at &quot;dragging&quot; my avatars around a
pre-defined course.  When I attach the same scripted device to my bots, they
do not move.

I am continuing my testing of the libomv/testclient based bots with the
newest 0.8.1 release, but have not had any success to date.  I am pursuing
the following options....

*  Radically increasing the force applied to the attachment -  Some of my
experiments were successful at getting bots to move when i gave them a
target to follow.   When I placed the target VERY close to the bot,  I COULD
get it to move slightly, leading me to believe the solution might be related
to bot/ground friction issues.

* Building a physical object that moves around the course I desire and
having the bot &quot;sit&quot; on the moving object.  With the recent updates to lsl
vehicle function in OpenSim, this may be the easiest short-term solution.

* Reworking the client movement functions to eliminate the use of Autopilot
based functions.

For my purposes, it is very important that the bots &quot;walk&quot;.  It would be
easiest if this was accomplished in the manner most similar to a &quot;regular&quot;
avatar, as this allows me to use existing AO devices, rather than having to
pre-program all of the animations into a script.  Please keep us all
up-to-date  on your findings  :)

&gt;<i>  Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have created a bot via a web service, but I was wondering if it is
</I>&gt;<i> possible to control the bot via inworld scripts? I have tried to do this
</I>&gt;<i> with an attachment to the bot, however, I can't move the bot even when the
</I>&gt;<i> attachment is physical and I try to move using llMoveToTarget. I know the
</I>&gt;<i> script is running as I have llSay messages between moves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Has anyone managed to do this? Or have any ideas I can try?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Izze
