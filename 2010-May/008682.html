As Melanie says, prebuild.bat sets up the solution files.  Any new files have to be added to prebuild.xml.

I see that the tests are still failing (see <A HREF="http://panda.opensimulator.org/test_runs/2148">http://panda.opensimulator.org/test_runs/2148</A>), probably because of these kind of issues.  Please could we resolve this asap otherwise, as Melanie says, we will have to roll back the changes for now.

Also btw, from quickly looking at some of your patch, the m_log references should always be private - each class needs its own.  We've had logging problems in the past from classes that inherit these.

Regards,
