<PRE>Hi folks.  This has been an informal thing up till now but after discussion on the IRC channel, I'm going to formally 
ask all core developers to hold off on making any major changes to git master code until 0.7.6 is released.

This is so that some nasty and difficult regressions can be hammered out without the situation being complicated by 
other major alterations.

The particularly sensitive area is anything connected with teleport or region cross (e.g. teleport or region cross code 
itself, attachments, capabilities, LLUDP clientstack, network code, etc.).  This is due to teleport regressions [1] that 
are highly sensitive to a large number of factors, and the fact that changing one thing in OpenSimulator can lead to 
unexpected effects elsewhere.

I'm not saying that all change should stop - please just use common sense.

I know this is not ideal but I think we're all agreed that it would be really nice to produce a good, stable 
OpenSimulator release incorporating all the performance and other improvements generated by the recent conference as 
well as other changes since February.

There is a 0.7.6-post-fixes branch, but I also want a low rate of change on master in order to get the widest possible 
testing base for fixes, as many people follow master code rather than release branches.  Of course, major changes can 
also be done in other branches for now.

Once these complicated regressions are squashed (e.g. possibly including [2] as well) I will produce a release candidate 
or two and then a release, as usual.  This process may last 2 or 3 weeks.  I would very much appreciate it if major 
changes could be held off until I give the all clear or the final release (not release candidate) is produced.  Believe 
me, I want to get a release out the door as soon as possible but it has to be of good quality.  Of course, any help with 
these regression issues is also very welcome.
