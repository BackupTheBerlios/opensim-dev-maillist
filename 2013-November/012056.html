<PRE>That's part of the point I'm trying to make, though I might be expressing myself poorly. Any viewer for Opensim would be a SL clone more or less. Because if multiple people using multiple viewers are on the same sim, they all need to be able to see the same things and interact the same way (without eg: a viewer seeing a box and another seeing a sphere). Therefore any non-SL viewer would have to implement exactly the same things SL has: An avatar you can move around as (which must have the same armature and body customization settings as SL viewer), the ability to build primitives (which must have the same shapes and features as SL viewer), a sky (which must have the same options as windlight), a terrain editor (which must work with the same heightmap terrain), etc.

As long as this is the case, there shouldn't even be a difference as far as Opensim is concerned. My worry was that there might be plans to divide Opensim between multiple technologies and client &lt;-&gt; server architectures, and Second Life viewer might then become a secondary matter. Then again this is unlikely, since like I said viewer specific changes in the server would mean some avatars could only see or use some things, which would likely be deemed as unacceptable in the default Opensim code.

Still, this mean Opensim must be a server for the SL technology, whether it's for use with a Linden viewer fork or a viewer someone created on their own. Being a general use platform conflicts with this limitation, which is why I was a little confused as to what Opensim's official stance toward viewers is.

</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure what this is all about - there are many mistakes/misunderstandings?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. There are several TPV&#8217;s that work with both SL and OS despite SL&#8217;s attempts to prevent it.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. There are several viewers specifically written for OS that do not share code base with the SL viewers.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. OS core developers have stated on many occasions that they want an open platform that people can package and do things other than SL look a likes. The goal is for a generic 3d world (VR) server, not a Sl clone. Although most people currently use it as an SL clone, nothing prevents you me or anyone from using out for our own VR design.
