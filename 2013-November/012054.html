<PRE>I am not sure what this is all about - there are many mistakes/misunderstandings?

1. There are several TPV&#8217;s that work with both SL and OS despite SL&#8217;s attempts to prevent it.
2. There are several viewers specifically written for OS that do not share code base with the SL viewers.
3. OS core developers have stated on many occasions that they want an open platform that people can package and do things other than SL look a likes. The goal is for a generic 3d world (VR) server, not a Sl clone. Although most people currently use it as an SL clone, nothing prevents you me or anyone from using out for our own VR design.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> More technically, this is why I believe a non-SL viewer will never exist: First of all, everything would have to look almost the same, since we wouldn't want those using the SL viewer to see something different than us. Terrain, primitive shapes, texture effects (transparency, shiny, bump, glow), avatar meshes (customized body, clothing, skins, attachments), the sky (day / night cycle and windlight settings), LSL functions with client-side effects (llSetText, llTargetOmega, etc) would all need to match. Once the world looks fine, you'd need to implement tons of other unique and complex features... such as media and web pages on prims, main map and minimap, the text and voice chat systems, and so much more. The details and eye candy would need attention too, such as a GUI and shaders (for HDR, shadows, depth of field) that can rival SL's. Even if someone had the time and energy to do all this as a FOSS application, they'd end up with a reverse-engineered version of the SL viewer that has little differences... meaning they wasted months doing something that's already there. In the end, any client for Opensim could only be Second Life, even if rewritten from zero and under a different name.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Non-SL based viewers *do* exist though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Considering this, I'm curious why it's better for Opensim to aim at being a general platform, rather than simply a server for the SL technology. And why the dev team doesn't create an official Opensim Viewer based on the latest version of SL, while of course allowing custom viewers like Firestorm to work too. Is OS still intended to work with other designs, and why / how? Does it risk distancing from SL viewers at some point, in hopes of a viewer written from scratch? Or does it intend to support a collection of different virtual world programs somehow? Also, what would happen if third party viewer developers ever got bored of supporting Opensim?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of these questions were addressed in the OSCC Viewers and OpenSimulator Panel this year <A HREF="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/38459235">http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/38459235</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is not to say what must or mustn't be done, since I'm far from having the knowledge and position to decide such things. But sticking to just SL and being closer the development of its viewers is something I thought would be a good initiative. I still feel that a change is needed, and that Opensim isn't reaching its full potential for some reason... which made me wonder if among other problems, some might have similar concerns about Opensim's colder relationship with viewers, and the lack of something specific officially intended to work with it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure what you mean by colder relationship with viewers? As the OpenSim compatibility developer for Firestorm, I've never felt that way. Whenever I've had a question, many people have been welcoming and willing to help. As far as development for platforms go, Linden Lab has been far more cold, secretive, and outright aggressive towards third party viewers than the OpenSim Core team.
