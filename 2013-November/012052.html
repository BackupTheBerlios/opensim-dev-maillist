<PRE>personally i would like to see some work on Avatar Advanced Scripting
(avatar as a &quot;bot&quot; aka RLV) if it can be done cleanly.

also a viewer that has a builtin Single Region Test Sim would ROCK.

&gt;<i> Although I've used Second Life and Opensim for more than 6 years, I'm still
</I>&gt;<i> uncertain where the &quot;open virtual worlds&quot; system based on them is going, and
</I>&gt;<i> the direction Opensim might take in relation to SL. Especially since during
</I>&gt;<i> the last years Linden made a lot of major changes, but Opensim doesn't seem
</I>&gt;<i> to have gotten more popular or attractive to main grid users. This
</I>&gt;<i> uncertainty kept me from spending as much time in SL and the free grids, and
</I>&gt;<i> spending more time seeking answers and looking for alternatives. Although
</I>&gt;<i> such matters were probably discussed a lot in the past, I'd like to get into
</I>&gt;<i> the things I'm looking to clarify, and also mention what I believe in case
</I>&gt;<i> it might be helpful for future development plans.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SL and Opensim are two different projects developed by different teams, each
</I>&gt;<i> going in its own direction more or less. The Second Life viewer is a client
</I>&gt;<i> for Linden's virtual worlds system (capable of connecting to other grids if
</I>&gt;<i> modified) while Opensim is a virtual worlds server not officially intended
</I>&gt;<i> for a specific client. Yet for the purpose to be achieved, they both need
</I>&gt;<i> each other. SL doesn't have another open-source server, Opensim doesn't have
</I>&gt;<i> another reliable client. Realistically speaking, neither of the two matters
</I>&gt;<i> will likely change: Linden might never open-source their SL server, and
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim won't have an own client written from scratch that has all of SL's
</I>&gt;<i> features and quality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Linden proved they don't care about Opensim, so things will likely not
</I>&gt;<i> change on the viewer's end. What jumps to my attention is that apparently,
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim is still waiting for something that will likely never come. Although
</I>&gt;<i> custom SL viewers are the only usable clients, Opensim still goes for a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;general purpose virtual worlds server&quot; and avoids being labeled as &quot;a
</I>&gt;<i> server for Second Life&quot;, while hesitating to get its own official viewer
</I>&gt;<i> based on SL. While at some point I believed an independent structure could
</I>&gt;<i> work, I now think there are too many technical implications for such to be
</I>&gt;<i> possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unlike simpler systems (like http, where Apache doesn't care if it's being
</I>&gt;<i> accessed by Firefox or Chrome) something of this complexity needs a precise
</I>&gt;<i> client - server design. If the server lacks features in the client, the
</I>&gt;<i> client will have dead parts. If the server has more features than the
</I>&gt;<i> client, it will eventually get slow bloated and confusing. Both the server
</I>&gt;<i> and all viewers accessing it need to revolve around a fixed design and set
</I>&gt;<i> of features, otherwise you'd have things only some avatars can see or use in
</I>&gt;<i> your sim. A different virtual world for example might not even use our
</I>&gt;<i> concept of primitives, could have voxel terrain instead of heightmaps, and
</I>&gt;<i> its own scripting language (like Lua) over LSL. Opensim wouldn't be able to
</I>&gt;<i> take it under its wing while staying compatible with SL, since the
</I>&gt;<i> technologies couldn't intersect or be compatible across viewers. It's like
</I>&gt;<i> intending a dedicated server for first person shooters to run Unreal
</I>&gt;<i> Tournament, Quake, DayZ and others at once.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More technically, this is why I believe a non-SL viewer will never exist:
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, everything would have to look almost the same, since we
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't want those using the SL viewer to see something different than us.
</I>&gt;<i> Terrain, primitive shapes, texture effects (transparency, shiny, bump,
</I>&gt;<i> glow), avatar meshes (customized body, clothing, skins, attachments), the
</I>&gt;<i> sky (day / night cycle and windlight settings), LSL functions with
</I>&gt;<i> client-side effects (llSetText, llTargetOmega, etc) would all need to match.
</I>&gt;<i> Once the world looks fine, you'd need to implement tons of other unique and
</I>&gt;<i> complex features... such as media and web pages on prims, main map and
</I>&gt;<i> minimap, the text and voice chat systems, and so much more. The details and
</I>&gt;<i> eye candy would need attention too, such as a GUI and shaders (for HDR,
</I>&gt;<i> shadows, depth of field) that can rival SL's. Even if someone had the time
</I>&gt;<i> and energy to do all this as a FOSS application, they'd end up with a
</I>&gt;<i> reverse-engineered version of the SL viewer that has little differences...
</I>&gt;<i> meaning they wasted months doing something that's already there. In the end,
</I>&gt;<i> any client for Opensim could only be Second Life, even if rewritten from
</I>&gt;<i> zero and under a different name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Considering this, I'm curious why it's better for Opensim to aim at being a
</I>&gt;<i> general platform, rather than simply a server for the SL technology. And why
</I>&gt;<i> the dev team doesn't create an official Opensim Viewer based on the latest
</I>&gt;<i> version of SL, while of course allowing custom viewers like Firestorm to
</I>&gt;<i> work too. Is OS still intended to work with other designs, and why / how?
</I>&gt;<i> Does it risk distancing from SL viewers at some point, in hopes of a viewer
</I>&gt;<i> written from scratch? Or does it intend to support a collection of different
</I>&gt;<i> virtual world programs somehow? Also, what would happen if third party
</I>&gt;<i> viewer developers ever got bored of supporting Opensim?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not to say what must or mustn't be done, since I'm far from having
</I>&gt;<i> the knowledge and position to decide such things. But sticking to just SL
</I>&gt;<i> and being closer the development of its viewers is something I thought would
</I>&gt;<i> be a good initiative. I still feel that a change is needed, and that Opensim
</I>&gt;<i> isn't reaching its full potential for some reason... which made me wonder if
</I>&gt;<i> among other problems, some might have similar concerns about Opensim's
</I>&gt;<i> colder relationship with viewers, and the lack of something specific
</I>&gt;<i> officially intended to work with it.
