</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>So are you saying if someone wanted to use OpenSimulator as a server for a
MMO-like game and they used a custom client with a custom protocol that was
not compatable with SL viewers, it should not be allowed? Given that it's
open source and MIT licensed, it's highly unlikely anything could be done
to stop such from happening.



&gt;<i> Part of that was clarified by this page:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Communication_Protocols">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Communication_Protocols</A> It describes how
</I>&gt;<i> communication with viewers works, and how I assume it plans to stay. The
</I>&gt;<i> interface (which that page names &quot;the Linden Lab viewer protocol&quot;) is one
</I>&gt;<i> thing I wondering about, and if it's a fixed interface that doesn't need to
</I>&gt;<i> be maintained for various viewers. Of course there's more than just the
</I>&gt;<i> protocol, such as being limited to the prim and avatar shapes viewers can
</I>&gt;<i> recognize. For this reason, I assume prim types like &quot;cube&quot;, &quot;sphere&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;torus&quot; will have to stay hard coded in Opensim and follow what Linden has.
</I>&gt;<i> These sort of things are usually was I unclear about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That wiki page is incomplete in that it does not mention IClientAPI, which
is the interface in OpenSimulator *specifically designed for implementing
new protocols* and is what the LL protocol uses to interface with the
simulation.
