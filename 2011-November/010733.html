<PRE>Hi Rory.  I think most people currently achieve this kind of thing via the RemoteAdmin interface [1].  However, I don't 
personally have any objection to having POSIX handling code in OpenSim if that's useful to people.

The best place for such a thing could be a separate OpenSim.ApplicationPlugins.PosixController package (or similar) 
rather than mixing it in with OpenSim.cs.

Things such as #if and #endif do exist in C# [2].  To be honest, I don't think you need to detect Windows as long as it 
does compile under Windows - one can include the mono.posix.dll in OpenSim directly if necessary.  And some Windows 
environments (e.g. Cygwin) do provide POSIX handling so it might work there.

If you want to submit a patch please create an account on Mantis [3] and post it there, putting it into the &quot;Patch 
included&quot; state.  As I would classify this as a feature, we will need you to sign and submit a contributor's agreement 
[4].  Thanks.

&gt;<i> Dear List,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My very first post in the dev mailing list, as I am going to spend much more time in my personal OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have written some code quite a while back and wanted to share my thoughts and start a discussion about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Signal Handling*
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, OpenSim services do NOT support POSIX signal handling when POSIX is available. This support is available
</I>&gt;<i> on pretty much any *nix platform including MacOS X. Windows does NOT support POSIX period.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Mono, POSIX signal handling can be easily accomplished using the mono.posix.dll.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have currently implemented nothing more but the TERM signal, to ensure the services are properly stopped, instead of
</I>&gt;<i> simply killed on the spot. This means that the service actually goes through the shutdown procedure (if any).
</I>&gt;<i> The next goal would be to implement HUP to reload the service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My current problem, is that the code is just there. No ifdef statements, nothing.
</I>&gt;<i> I simply lack the knowledge in .NET/Mono to exclude the code from an environment that does not include posix.
</I>&gt;<i> Some pointers in the right direction would be much appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Discussion*
</I>&gt;<i> When creating services, there must be an easy way to start/stop them. Especially on *nix this comes in handy.
</I>&gt;<i> Shoving the word &quot;exit&quot; or &quot;shutdown&quot; into the service cli is just not working all the time and is error prone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Adding POSIX signal handling would be considered &quot;standard&quot; in such services. The fact that MS Windows does not
</I>&gt;<i> support POSIX signals is simply disregarded. The equivalent on Windows would be to have a service binary that runs
</I>&gt;<i> the OpenSim services (I think that already exists).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There aren't that many other &quot;standard&quot; solutions to the same problem, and although signal handling wouldn't work on
</I>&gt;<i> ONE platform (ONE being Windows), it is guaranteed to work on ALL others (ALL being the *nix ones lol).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So to start the discussion, here are some questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Is there any interest in this code?
</I>&gt;<i> With this I mean: would we want POSIX signal handling or will we try to develop a different way to solve the same problem?
</I>&gt;<i> 2. If there is any interest, who do I send my patch to?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With kind regards,
