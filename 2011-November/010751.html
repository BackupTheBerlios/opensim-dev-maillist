<PRE>The easiest way would be to make your bitcoin client open port 80 on
your local host (or another port) for localhost use only. Then a
script could send you to
127.0.0.1:xxxx/pay?to=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx or
similar and you complete the transaction onn this locally served
html page.

</I>&gt;<i> My ultimate aim is that rather than money being stored in a database

</I>&gt;<i> which would be stored locally on their PC. There would be a money

</I>&gt;<i> for avatars and confirming transactions, but rather than making
</I>&gt;<i> transactions itself like the existing DTL server, it would just tell
</I>&gt;<i> the client on the PC how much to pay and to what address, then confirm
</I>&gt;<i> that the transaction had been made and deliver inventory etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Rather than hacking BitCoin integration into the viewer, I'm thinking
</I>&gt;<i> it might be good to run a separate piece of client software - a custom
</I>&gt;<i> BitCoin client responsible for managing the user's money - alongside
</I>&gt;<i> the viewer. When the money module on the server thinks the client
</I>&gt;<i> should spend some money on something (eg because the user made a &quot;buy&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> request with their viewer), I want it to send a message to the viewer,
</I>&gt;<i> and have that message somehow get to the BitCoin client program.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think I know how to do this if I don't mind putting a human in the
</I>&gt;<i> middle of the process: The money module tell the viewer to show the
</I>&gt;<i> user a message saying, &quot;Please pay 0.1 BitCoins to address xyz&quot;, and
</I>&gt;<i> the user would open the BitCoin client and pay the money, then the
</I>&gt;<i> server would check the payment and complete the transaction. But it
</I>&gt;<i> would be better if I could somehow get the viewer to pass the
</I>&gt;<i> information on to the client behind the scenes, without bothering the
</I>&gt;<i> user.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So without altering existing viewers, can anyone suggest a way to get
</I>&gt;<i> a message from the server, via the viewer, to another process? The
</I>&gt;<i> other process could be listening on a local port, watching a file or
</I>&gt;<i> doing whatever it needs to do. I'm open to nasty hacks, but not
</I>&gt;<i> really, really nasty hacks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS. I'm new to OpenSim module development and I've never tried to hack
</I>&gt;<i> the viewer, so be gentle with me if there's some kind of fundamental
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstanding behind my question...
