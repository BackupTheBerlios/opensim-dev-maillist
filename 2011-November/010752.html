<PRE>I've used gridproxy (part of libomv -
<A HREF="http://lib.openmetaverse.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://lib.openmetaverse.org/wiki/Main_Page</A> ) to interface to other
processes without modifying the LL viewer by writing a *gridproxy
plugin*which is basically a small c# program in the form of a dll
file. I believe
there are some examples that come with libomv. Gridproxy monitors traffic
between the server and the  viewer and allows messages to be modified and
injected into the traffic stream. It's probably not the most user-friendly
way to accomplish what you want but it could be packaged into a fairly
simple to use program.

Another method I've seen is to set up a process that monitors the chat/IM
log files that the viewer can create. I've seen this method used fairly
successfully for adding accessability features such as chat text-to-speech
for visually impaired users.

Good luck with whatever path you choose :)

</I>&gt;<i> entertainment - when we discussed it on opensim-users the other day
</I>&gt;<i> the community didn't seem that into it).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My ultimate aim is that rather than money being stored in a database

</I>&gt;<i> which would be stored locally on their PC. There would be a money
</I>&gt;<i> module on the server which would deal with managing BitCoin addresses
</I>&gt;<i> for avatars and confirming transactions, but rather than making
</I>&gt;<i> transactions itself like the existing DTL server, it would just tell
</I>&gt;<i> the client on the PC how much to pay and to what address, then confirm
</I>&gt;<i> that the transaction had been made and deliver inventory etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rather than hacking BitCoin integration into the viewer, I'm thinking
</I>&gt;<i> it might be good to run a separate piece of client software - a custom
</I>&gt;<i> BitCoin client responsible for managing the user's money - alongside
</I>&gt;<i> the viewer. When the money module on the server thinks the client
</I>&gt;<i> should spend some money on something (eg because the user made a &quot;buy&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> request with their viewer), I want it to send a message to the viewer,
</I>&gt;<i> and have that message somehow get to the BitCoin client program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I know how to do this if I don't mind putting a human in the
</I>&gt;<i> middle of the process: The money module tell the viewer to show the
</I>&gt;<i> user a message saying, &quot;Please pay 0.1 BitCoins to address xyz&quot;, and
</I>&gt;<i> the user would open the BitCoin client and pay the money, then the
</I>&gt;<i> server would check the payment and complete the transaction. But it
</I>&gt;<i> would be better if I could somehow get the viewer to pass the
</I>&gt;<i> information on to the client behind the scenes, without bothering the
</I>&gt;<i> user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So without altering existing viewers, can anyone suggest a way to get
</I>&gt;<i> a message from the server, via the viewer, to another process? The
</I>&gt;<i> other process could be listening on a local port, watching a file or
</I>&gt;<i> doing whatever it needs to do. I'm open to nasty hacks, but not
</I>&gt;<i> really, really nasty hacks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS. I'm new to OpenSim module development and I've never tried to hack
</I>&gt;<i> the viewer, so be gentle with me if there's some kind of fundamental
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstanding behind my question...
