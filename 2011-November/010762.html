<PRE>There are both pros and cons to this:

On the pro side, it gives one more way to set variable data into
otherwise static files, easing synchronization of configurations.

On the con side, the syntax is awkward as hell and it' useful to
only a very small group of people (those who grok *nix)

I think what clinches it is that nini has been dormant for so long
that the risks in a fork are negligible.

So, +1

</I>&gt;<i> response.
