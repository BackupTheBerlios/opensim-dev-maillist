<PRE>I would just like to add that there are historically technical
limitations with textures over 1024x1024. I don't know about currently,
but until relatively recently, there was no OpenGL implementation that
supported larger textures properly.

I don't know if this is still the case, however, or how wide spread this
support is - and would such a movement require compatibility work for
supporting clients without these capabilities.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it in only in the Viewer?
</I>&gt;<i> Some devs point to the viewer clients being coded to limit

</I>&gt;<i> increased interaction between viewer developers and simulator 
</I>&gt;<i> developers, perhaps there is a renewed possibility to solve

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> If the only limits are in the viewer UPLOAD, then perhaps 
</I>&gt;<i> a method of image insertion at the database level or 
</I>&gt;<i> in the simulator console could be provided for higher 
</I>&gt;<i> resolution textures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What should the limit be?It is estimated that increasing the limit to 
</I>&gt;<i> at least 4096 x 4096 pixels would suffice for 
</I>&gt;<i> most applications. But, for future expansion, 
</I>&gt;<i> it should be up to the designer, the sim operator, or 
</I>&gt;<i> the grid operator to set such limits (if any).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The areas of design that suffer the most from 
</I>&gt;<i> current texture size limits (1024x1024 pixels) are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. AVATARS: Avatar skin and system clothing. (Currently: very blurry! )
</I>&gt;<i> 2. HUGE PRIMS: Large prim objects, such as buildings, environment/ space/ sky/ backdrops/ backgrounds, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. SCULPTY: Visible texture applied to surface of sculpted objects.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. MESH: Visible texture applied to surface of mesh objects.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. LAND: Teraform, land/ground RAWs, textures, and data maps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reproduction of the current situation:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Upload a 4096x4096 image for use with avatar upper body UV wrapped texture for system avatar.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Observe after upload, that the image has been converted by down-sampling and poorly compressing to a resulting 1024x1024 texture.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Apply the texture to the upper body of the system avatar in the opensimulator region.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Look at the avatar in the opensimulator region, and observe that the texture is fuzzy.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Compare the difference in sharpness of the original design image to the fuzziness of the inworld texture.
</I>&gt;<i>
