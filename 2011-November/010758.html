It is not that easy to review patch files that have changes for several 
different issues at the same time. Separate patches dealing with 
improvements to search, dealing with hostsregister, and restructuring would 
have made rewing the changes easier.

Good catch on noticing events and classifieds weren't using the user 
supplied text in the search query. A modified version of your change has 
been committed for events and I'm going to do the classified one shortly.
BTW, your original change didn't protect against possible SQL injection.

I don't like the idea of the search code being able to remove entries from 
the hostsregister table. The data might be useful for some debugging 
situatins. Any removal of the data should be done via an external routine. 
The timestamp might be useful but someone who runs a bigger grid might want 
to comment on that. Knowing how often OS instances are polled along with the 
failcounter field can tell you how long it has been since the last 
successful poll of an OS instance.

Both the Search and Profile modules will be installed in most OpenSim 
installations although each can work without the other. I like the division 
of labour that exists between the two modules. I don't think moving code 
between modules to avoid the overlap in classifieds is the right thing to 
do. It might even complicate things a bit if you only wanted to install one 
of the two modules. I'm open to discussion on this if someone wants to make 
a case for moving the classifieds code to the profile module.
