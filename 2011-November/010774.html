<PRE>Justin, a quick question.

I had problems with group permissions when saving an OAR on one grid 
(MOSES) where I have to use a group for all objects and then when 
restoring the OAR on other grids (OSGrid and Openvue).  The group 
name showed as &quot;unknown&quot; as of course the group UUID would not exist 
in the new grid environment... but what was worse was that I did not 
seem to be able to change the objects back to group &quot;none&quot; or to 
another specific group on the new grid.

the alternative of somehow selecting all objects on a region and 
setting them to None before the OAR is saved is mostly not feasible 
due to autoreturn rules, or is very difficult to do at the viewer in 
a reliable way.

I reported this on Mantis with a suggestion that save OAR or load OAR 
might be able to set the group to none on save or load whichever was easiest.

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=5668">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=5668</A>

I am just about to start to look at this again to see if I can work 
out a proper route to get the OpenVCE OAR in its new tidier and 
better developed state off MOSES into a form I can distribute to 
others.  Before I start I wonder if you have any observations that 
will help me, or if you think at some stage the save/load OAR to 
ignore the group seeing on objects is feasible?

Best wishes, Ai (Austin)
