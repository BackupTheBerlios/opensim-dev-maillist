This is a viewer issue and not really an OpenSimulator issue per say, it
would be better taken up with the viewer devs, there are really no
limitations on the server side for that limit the size of any texture, in
fact the viewer also has no problem displaying larger textures, i have
several 2048x2048 texture in SL, i believe they were uploaded with a
special LibOMV client back in the day before LL closed some holes.
Technically the only place that limits the size of the texture is when the
viewer converts the image to a jp2 image before it sends it to
OpenSimulator, if this can be modified then we could upload larger
textures, though there may be some other good reasons we would not allow
this, such as performance and such, the files could be quite large, and
having to download lots of these large textures could really cripple
things, we would need to do some tests to be sure, there may also be other
difficulties involved for TPVs with the Terms of Service of secondlife and
making such modifications to the viewers, this really needs to be taken up
with the Viewer Developers to see what they think.

&gt;<i> This is part of an effort to increase the awareness in

</I>&gt;<i> (images greater than current 1024x1024 pixels)
</I>&gt;<i> to be used in stand-alone and/or grid operation of

</I>&gt;<i> OpenSimulator. If we are to make progress in 21st century
</I>&gt;<i> 3D graphics, higher resolution imagery is needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it in only in the Viewer?
</I>&gt;<i> Some devs point to the viewer clients being coded to limit
</I>&gt;<i> the image size at upload. Since OpenSimulator project has
</I>&gt;<i> recently changed license and participation method, to provide
</I>&gt;<i> increased interaction between viewer developers and simulator
</I>&gt;<i> developers, perhaps there is a renewed possibility to solve
</I>&gt;<i> this problem in the near future. Some TPV viewers have provided
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility switches in the Grid Manager section for
</I>&gt;<i> use with OpenSimulator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a SIMULATOR or server-side solution?
</I>&gt;<i> If the only limits are in the viewer UPLOAD, then perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> a method of image insertion at the database level or
</I>&gt;<i> in the simulator console could be provided for higher
</I>&gt;<i> resolution textures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What should the limit be?It is estimated that increasing the limit to
</I>&gt;<i> at least 4096 x 4096 pixels would suffice for
</I>&gt;<i> most applications. But, for future expansion,
</I>&gt;<i> it should be up to the designer, the sim operator, or
</I>&gt;<i> the grid operator to set such limits (if any).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The areas of design that suffer the most from
</I>&gt;<i> current texture size limits (1024x1024 pixels) are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. AVATARS: Avatar skin and system clothing. (Currently: very blurry! )
</I>&gt;<i> 2. HUGE PRIMS: Large prim objects, such as buildings, environment/ space/
</I>&gt;<i> sky/ backdrops/ backgrounds, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. SCULPTY: Visible texture applied to surface of sculpted objects.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. MESH: Visible texture applied to surface of mesh objects.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. LAND: Teraform, land/ground RAWs, textures, and data maps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reproduction of the current situation:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Upload a 4096x4096 image for use with avatar upper body UV wrapped
</I>&gt;<i> texture for system avatar.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Observe after upload, that the image has been converted by
</I>&gt;<i> down-sampling and poorly compressing to a resulting 1024x1024 texture.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Apply the texture to the upper body of the system avatar in the
</I>&gt;<i> opensimulator region.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Look at the avatar in the opensimulator region, and observe that the
</I>&gt;<i> texture is fuzzy.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Compare the difference in sharpness of the original design image to the
</I>&gt;<i> fuzziness of the inworld texture.
</I>&gt;<i>
