Cool to hear - I've also thought of it a bit, when someone asked about it, as it would be simple to integrate in the Naali / Tundra client.

Please do it like this so we can use it too :) (we don't use slviewer)

I don't know if there is anything in the LSL api for this -- I know LSL can open http connections, to do xml-rpc style stuff, but probably that is for the server side only.

Dunno if a webview in a client could do it, perhaps if you can use the url opening command to open a html page in slviewer's webview that would send the command with http to the local money component .. might be though that the same origin policy in browsers prevents that.

&gt;<i> PS. I'm new to OpenSim module development and I've never tried to hack
</I>&gt;<i> the viewer, so be gentle with me if there's some kind of fundamental
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstanding behind my question...
</I>
I don't see any misunderstanding, just that AFAIK vanilla slviewer doesn't support this. Would certainly be hackable there somehow.

If you make the standalone component, I can do a proof of concept test UI for it to Naali/Tundra :) Perhaps someone can hack it then somehow to some slviewer based thing too. Unless there already is some way that I just don't know about.
