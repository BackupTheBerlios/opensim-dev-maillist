</I>Yes, you can pass on the dll file to anyone, they just need to add the 
file to their /bin folder.

You do not need to repuild your file with every new OpenSim version made 
available. Once in a while there are modifications in OpenSim which will 
require your module to also be updated due to function changes (eg 
renaming or parameter changes). Only then you will have to update your 
module and pass on the new dll file. I have several projects which also 
only pass on closed sourced dll's, and untill now there was only 1 
update needed in over a year.

Depending on your module it will also be neccessary to compile in .net 
and mono enviroments, even for diffrent net/mono versions.
