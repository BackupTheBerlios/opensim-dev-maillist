<PRE>Tonight I will reinstall OS on my dev server and do some of the main things
for testing and try to comprise a list of things that are issues/could be
done better. I'm not a C++/C#/C devolper to any extent so I'm glad to help
out the project to getting closer and closer to beta stage by doing this. I
guess maybe this could actually be more so of a community effort to try to
get some of the users that normally would say &quot;AHHH ITS NOT WORKING
BLARG!!!!!!!!!&quot; to try to get the communitys direct feedback on what should
be implimented.

My idea: In the next few days ill try to make a script to allow for users
to report what they think is most important and then vote upon what is the
most important thing(s) to have before turning into beta.

Thoughts? Reply.
