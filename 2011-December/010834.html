<PRE>Hi Hendrik.  Some others have outlined the existing work on server-side NPCs in OpenSimulator, which reactivated code 
that had rotted away.  The current server-side NPCs are quite recent and really still under development but they are 
functional.

I've worked on the NPCs most recently and it continues as an interest of mine.  However, it's not currently my top priority.

The NPC module is at OpenSim/Region/OptionalModules/World/NPC.  It has some oddities caused by its past (e.g. 
unnecessarily taking scene arguments on all calls).  It is hooked into by OSSL script commands.  However, it would 
certainly be fine to have an external interface for NPC manipulation as well.

Because there's currently no concept of 'npc' in the Second Life system, the viewer currently sees them as just like any 
other user.  This also makes their use a little awkward (e.g. you can't just drop scripts into an 'npc' directly - you 
have to put them in an object that attaches to them.  Getting beyond this gets into complicated viewer alteration 
territory.  I think we would be happy to accept patches for this provided they are generic.  Anything really specific 
could still be shipped as a region module.

Indeed, I'm very happy to accept NPC patches in general (providing that they pass the usual inspection).  Naturally, 
they would have to be BSD licensed and for significant non bug-fix changes we would need a signed contributor's 
agreement, as per [1].

All the best,
