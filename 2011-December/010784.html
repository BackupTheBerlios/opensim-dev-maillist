<PRE>Understandable, I was just throwing out the idea more so.

&gt;<i> Hello
</I>&gt;<i> Well i was also badly surprised by the sit change. But at the one of a long
</I>&gt;<i> discussion on OSG forum i have realized that if someone has right to vote
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> stabilizing it would be the devs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From my RL work i know that the more stable the project is is the less fun
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> work on it and the more it becomes hard/boring job.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason is simple. Your hands are tightly tied up by the current code.
</I>&gt;<i> Before you start to implement any idea you have to study the current code,
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> possible running modes, interactions and tons of other things whose may be
</I>&gt;<i> affected by your code. In many cases you even need approval to start with
</I>&gt;<i> something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Trust me, this can be sometime a totally disgusting process. So the devs
</I>&gt;<i> needs
</I>&gt;<i> own high motivation to do such hard work and the team leader needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> sure
</I>&gt;<i> that his team is ready/motivated for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like most of other users i would love to see OS more stable than SL is.
</I>&gt;<i> But i
</I>&gt;<i> know we can not force the devs by votes or something else into it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other side. Isn't it working already good enough? Isn't it enough to
</I>&gt;<i> have all the sources codes so anyone can choose only patches he likes? Is
</I>&gt;<i> someone really forced to upgrade?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure how for someone else. But my answers to above questions are
</I>&gt;<i> giving me
</I>&gt;<i> the patience to wait for the devs to initiate the process them selves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hoover the vote idea sounds to me in another way. What about having a vote
</I>&gt;<i> system for features where users can vote by DONATIONS. And pay part of the
</I>&gt;<i> donation to a dev who would implement it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes, Bo

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most important thing(s) to have before turning into beta.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thoughts? Reply.
