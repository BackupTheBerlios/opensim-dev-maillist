<PRE>Hello
Well i was also badly surprised by the sit change. But at the one of a long 
discussion on OSG forum i have realized that if someone has right to vote for 
stabilizing it would be the devs.

From my RL work i know that the more stable the project is is the less fun is 
work on it and the more it becomes hard/boring job. 

The reason is simple. Your hands are tightly tied up by the current code. 
Before you start to implement any idea you have to study the current code, all 
possible running modes, interactions and tons of other things whose may be 
affected by your code. In many cases you even need approval to start with 
something.

Trust me, this can be sometime a totally disgusting process. So the devs needs 
own high motivation to do such hard work and the team leader needs to be sure 
that his team is ready/motivated for it.

Like most of other users i would love to see OS more stable than SL is. But i 
know we can not force the devs by votes or something else into it.

On the other side. Isn't it working already good enough? Isn't it enough to 
have all the sources codes so anyone can choose only patches he likes? Is 
someone really forced to upgrade?

Not sure how for someone else. But my answers to above questions are giving me 
the patience to wait for the devs to initiate the process them selves.

Hoover the vote idea sounds to me in another way. What about having a vote 
system for features where users can vote by DONATIONS. And pay part of the 
donation to a dev who would implement it?

Best wishes, Bo
