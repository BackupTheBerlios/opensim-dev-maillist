<PRE>Definitively a standalone application, albeit in my dream world, it would communicate with the servers thru the http interfaces, not directly into the database layers. (which probably would give out http interfaces some more TLC)

The various bits of binary data which &gt; &gt; make up the page/prim (e.g. pngs and gifs for webpages, textures, &gt; &gt; scripts and sounds for second life), are represented by uris/asset ids &gt; &gt; in the exported xml.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as in a 'full' webpage format, a full sl export would also export &gt; &gt; those resources in a separate 'package'/'region'/'directory' to which &gt; &gt; the asset ids could resolve.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Was actual texture data exported in byte[] format before the libsl &gt; &gt; change? I apologise for my ignorance on this point.&gt; &gt; Well, two issues. First off, yes the Texture field is coming out as a&gt; byte[]. But that is just the texturing description. The asset&gt; representing actually used textures is in asset land, and isn't&gt; exported.&gt; &gt; My recent thoughts on the save/load model is the following.&gt; &gt; 1. It should be a seperate program, OpenSimDump.exe (or something), so&gt; that you can run it while OpenSim is running, or when OpenSim isn't&gt; running, and have no fear that OpenSim might alter the data in some&gt; way while it is coming up.&gt; &gt; 2. It should read OpenSim.ini for the data sources for assets and&gt; primstorage. This would let you use 2 different OpenSim.ini files&gt; to dump from sqlite and move everything to mysql (for instance).&gt; &gt; 3. It should create what it does in an on disk directory, that would&gt; look something like:&gt; &gt; dump/&gt; prims.xml&gt; assets.xml&gt; UUID-UUID-UUID.jp2&gt; UUID-UUID-UUID.xyz&gt; &gt; Basically, appropriate metadata would end up in xml files. When&gt; dealing with binary data we translate back to appropriate binary&gt; files named by UUID.&gt; &gt; 4. It should support a mode that dumps ALL assets, or one that dumps&gt; only assets referenced by prims.&gt; &gt; For right now, there will be no guaruntee of compatibility between&gt; OpenSim revisions. I think it will take a couple of iterations before&gt; we get an at rest definition that makes sense. I really doubt collada&gt; is that right at rest definition, as it seems pretty heavy for what we&gt; need (though supporting a collada import in the future would be&gt; definitely interesting).&gt; &gt; I'm going to start hacking on this tomorrow, though it likely won't&gt; finish prior to me heading away for vacation. I'll check in stuff daily&gt; if not more frequently so other folks can look and help if they are&gt; interested.&gt; &gt; -Sean&gt; &gt; -- &gt; __________________________________________________________________&gt; &gt; Sean Dague Mid-Hudson Valley&gt; sean at dague dot net Linux Users Group&gt; <A HREF="http://dague.net">http://dague.net</A> <A HREF="http://mhvlug.org">http://mhvlug.org</A>&gt; &gt; There is no silver bullet.
