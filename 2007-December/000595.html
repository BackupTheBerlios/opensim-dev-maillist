<PRE>Yes, again; we should implement this as an interface, so that I, for one, can sidestep the whole thing and supply settings based on hard-coded algorithms; Adam can do his ini thing and sdague et al his db based thingies.

On a side note, this is also implemented in the Reg Api that third parties can use to auto-register their members onto SL; there is an option to confine the newly registered user account to an estate owned by the registrator; ie to create a 'walled garden' within SL.  /Stefan

There's another purpose for estates also.   
Grid separation, on the same infrastructure.
 
The EstateID, and ParentEstateID Property
 
Basically, this is what LL uses to separate the MainGrid from the Teen Grid while not significantly increasing the hardware or configuration requirements.
 
All Users have a EstateID Property..  that corresponds to the regions and users that they can interact with and see. 
Example
*One main grid has an estateID 0.  All users to this grid are created with an estateID 0 property.
 
*A teen grid has an estateID 2.   All users who sign up for this grid are created with an estateID 2
When users pull up the map, they can only see the regions where the EstateID or the ParentEstateID = their user estateID property.
 
This also extends to Instant Messages and teleports.
 
'God Users' can see, interact with, and move in between all EstateIDs
 
I can see this being used by a service provider to give users their own 'grid'.  
 
My purpose for mentioning this is to make sure that this functionality is considered, *not to rehash the idea of estates*

Pardoning the slightly inflamatory subject line - allow me to clarify.The &quot;Estate&quot; system as currently implemented by Linden Lab is shall we say ... imperfect?Right now -- as it stands, an estate is a collection of regions under acommon name sharing a few properties:       * Estate Owner is shared across all regions in the estate       * Estate Managers are shared across all regions in the estate        * Estate Bans are shared across the estate       * The time-of-day is shared across all regions in the estateFrankly - I think this is mediocre at best, very limiting at worst.For example, say you have two seperate groups of regions that want to share a single ban list? RBL's seem to indicate people will want to do this.So - what's the solution? Remove abitrary groupings and make each ofthese something independently configurable, for example:        Ban List               Rather than have a single list shared among X regions,               allow regions to be configured to have a remote banlist               - some kind of URL where they can POST / GET queries                about user status. Put this functionality into a               BanModule-type RegionModule so it can be swapped or               configured independently at whim.       Estate Managers               Similar to the above, add support in the permission               manager for looking up the permissions of a individual               user from a remote URL or address.Now, the PermissionsModule and BanModule should respond to messages from the client sent by the estate tools -- but on the backend we have a muchmore configurable situation which is more suitable for large scaledeployments.Regards,Adam_______________________________________________ Opensim-dev mailing <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">listOpensim-dev at lists.berlios.dehttps</A>://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev _______________________________________________Opensim-dev mailing <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">listOpensim-dev at lists.berlios.dehttps</A>://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev-- ===================================The windscours the earth for prayersThe night obscures them
