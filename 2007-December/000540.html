Well, two issues.  First off, yes the Texture field is coming out as a
byte[].  But that is just the texturing description.  The asset
representing actually used textures is in asset land, and isn't
exported.

My recent thoughts on the save/load model is the following.

1.  It should be a seperate program, OpenSimDump.exe (or something), so
    that you can run it while OpenSim is running, or when OpenSim isn't
    running, and have no fear that OpenSim might alter the data in some
    way while it is coming up.

2.  It should read OpenSim.ini for the data sources for assets and
    primstorage.  This would let you use 2 different OpenSim.ini files
    to dump from sqlite and move everything to mysql (for instance).

3.  It should create what it does in an on disk directory, that would
    look something like:
    
    dump/
	prims.xml
	assets.xml
	UUID-UUID-UUID.jp2
        UUID-UUID-UUID.xyz

    Basically, appropriate metadata would end up in xml files.  When
    dealing with binary data we translate back to appropriate binary
    files named by UUID.

4.  It should support a mode that dumps ALL assets, or one that dumps
    only assets referenced by prims.

For right now, there will be no guaruntee of compatibility between
OpenSim revisions.  I think it will take a couple of iterations before
we get an at rest definition that makes sense.  I really doubt collada
is that right at rest definition, as it seems pretty heavy for what we
need (though supporting a collada import in the future would be
definitely interesting).

I'm going to start hacking on this tomorrow, though it likely won't
finish prior to me heading away for vacation.  I'll check in stuff daily
if not more frequently so other folks can look and help if they are
interested.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
