<PRE>Gerikes,
 
actually, several of the core devs are great fans of unit testing with nunit, myself included - our lack of tests is partly historical, and partly because it risks becoming a threshold for non-tes-savvy developers.
 
This said, anyone is free to contribute good tests; but for the sake of discussion, I'd like to discuss a set of ground rules:
 
#1) Tests should be unit tests, incorporate only a few classes and they should be narrow in scope (only test a few results)
#2) Tests should primarily test outcomes, not internal behaviour (ie, what is returned, not what is called or state changes)#3) Anyone should be allowed to throw away a test that they don't understand well enough to change.#4) Tests should be a pragmatic part of your daily coding, not a one-off policy thing.
The motivations for these points are;
 
#1) The more classes involved, the more the test will hinder effortless refactoring, as when moving functions from one place to another. The tests themselves become 'couplers'
#2) Decoupled code should ideally keep minimal state; and setting up tests for testing behaviour and internal state tend to make them 'broad' and 'complex' (violates #1 and #3)
#3) Test should make you faster, not slower. If changing the code becomes difficult because of a test, the test should go, not the change. Either chuck the test, or narrow its scope.#4) Code up a testing workbench instead of step-debugging. I promise you you will gain. Debug by introducing tests based on your assumptions. If you see something that you think you know the outcome of, make a test for it to be sure.
 
This is my truth, now give me yours.
/Stefan

I come&gt; &gt; from a short background creating internal corperate web sites using C# /&gt; &gt; Monorail, but have interests in virtual worlds, and am happy to see such a&gt; &gt; project being built on .NET.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I've been using automated unit and integration testing for almost a&gt; &gt; year now, and found it drastically increased the quality of my code. What is&gt; &gt; the position of the project in terms of how unit testing are implemented?&gt; &gt; Does anyone on the project write their own but just not commit them?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd be hasty to try to come in here trying to change the world (so to&gt; &gt; speak), so perhaps I'll start smaller. I'm planning on trying to grok the&gt; &gt; code base by developing my own test harness that can be used for integration&gt; &gt; testing. Basically, it would be a region that could be started, and have&gt; &gt; tests run against it, probably in the form of sending commands through bots&gt; &gt; connected using libsecondlife. The API would allow for the tests to run&gt; &gt; multiple times, perhaps switching out things like which data store manager&gt; &gt; is used during the test so that a single test can be run against multiple&gt; &gt; implementations.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would try to allow the creation of tests to be simple and straightforward,&gt; &gt; such as...&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Test]&gt; &gt; public void CanInstantMessage()&gt; &gt; {&gt; &gt; const string message = &quot;Test Message&quot;;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TestAvatar avatar1 = ActivateNewAvatar();&gt; &gt; TestAvatar avatar2 = ActivateNewAvatar();&gt; &gt; avatar1.Perform(Action.InstantMessage(avatar2, message));&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Assert.AreEqual(1, avatar2.RecievedMessages.From(avatar2).Count);&gt; &gt; Assert.AreEqual(message, avatar2.RecievedMessages.From&gt; &gt; (avatar2).First().Message);&gt; &gt; }&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So that's it, I'm interested in any feedback you have.&gt; &gt; ++++ on getting some automated testing into the tree. The lack of that&gt; right now is mostly based on rapid turnover in the current code, and&gt; lack of time, not lack of interest.&gt; &gt; Patches that start to integrate automated testing into the tree are&gt; welcomed as long as they can be executed on both MS.NET and Mono using&gt; nant (we're very strongly bi-platform).&gt; &gt; My suggestion is to start small on one area of the code and get that&gt; well tested, then extend througout. I think you'll get a lot of support&gt; from everyone in the dev team if you jump in and start contributing&gt; here.&gt; &gt; More work on test engineering is one of my new years resolutions.&gt; &gt; -Sean&gt; &gt; -- &gt; __________________________________________________________________&gt; &gt; Sean Dague Mid-Hudson Valley&gt; sean at dague dot net Linux Users Group&gt; <A HREF="http://dague.net">http://dague.net</A> <A HREF="http://mhvlug.org">http://mhvlug.org</A>&gt; &gt; There is no silver bullet.
