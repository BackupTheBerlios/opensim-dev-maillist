&gt;<i> Following some IRC conversations with MW, I've been thinking about how

</I>&gt;<i> the issue for OpenSim 0.6.  In the spirit of iterative, open source 
</I>&gt;<i> development, this is probably not the most optimal design but rather an 
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to identify a basic way of doing it now that won't cause time 
</I>&gt;<i> consuming problems down the road.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As MW has outlined, there are two aspects involved in implementing 
</I>&gt;<i> persistent prim inventories - persisting them in an avatar's inventory 
</I>&gt;<i> and persisting them in a region.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I propose that in both of these cases we store the prim's inventory as 
</I>&gt;<i> part of its XML serialization, which I believe is stored as an asset 
</I>&gt;<i> when a prim (or prim group) is taken into an avatar's inventory.  
</I>&gt;<i> Metadata about items in the prim's inventory (name, permissions, etc) 
</I>&gt;<i> would be stored as part of the serialization.  
</I>
&gt;<i> However, all assets within that inventory (other prims as well as data
</I>&gt;<i> such as scripts and textures) would be stored as separate assets and
</I>&gt;<i> linked to the serialization by asset id.
</I>
If possible, I'd like to make this a bit more explicit.  It would be
nice to be able to queury across these inventory items without having to
do a deep parsing of data in the database.

It would be educational, at least for me, to see a &quot;sample&quot; of said
data.  My brain works better on examples than on descriptions.

&gt;<i> I believe this will work without too many changes for the avatar 
</I>&gt;<i> inventory, since an asset server is already available in both standalone 
</I>&gt;<i> and grid modes.  The same asset server is also available locally to a 
</I>&gt;<i> region in standalone mode.  However, I expect it would be a bad idea to 
</I>&gt;<i> fetch assets from the grid asset server every time a grid mode region 
</I>&gt;<i> started up - both in terms of unscalable load and bandwidth costs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I would propose that as part of the implementation of persistent prim 
</I>&gt;<i> inventories, we need a local asset server that acts largely as a cache 
</I>&gt;<i> for the grid asset server.  When a prim is initially rezzed to a region, 
</I>&gt;<i> the only additional data other than that which we should supply already 
</I>&gt;<i> (name, description, etc), is the asset id representing the serialized 
</I>&gt;<i> parts of the prim. (Actually, I suspect that we're serializing things 
</I>&gt;<i> such as name and description which we arguably shouldn't be - as 
</I>&gt;<i> evidenced by the fact that if I change the name of a prim in inventory 
</I>&gt;<i> and rerez it, it comes back with the name it had when I originally took 
</I>&gt;<i> it from the region).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On receiving the asset ID, the region immediately makes a request to its 
</I>&gt;<i> local server asset cache for the serialized data in order to run any 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts in the prim inventory.  If the asset is not found locally, then 
</I>&gt;<i> the request goes out to the grid server.  Once the grid server supplies 
</I>&gt;<i> the asset, it can be cached persistently locally (as assets never change).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once the asset is received by the original region calling code, it's 
</I>&gt;<i> deserialized and loaded into memory.  The asset ids contained within the 
</I>&gt;<i> prim inventory can be requested as required.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If any of the metadata for those contents changes, then a new serialized 
</I>&gt;<i> asset is stored locally.  If any of the prim contents change (e.g. a 
</I>&gt;<i> script is updated), then both the contents information (with the new 
</I>&gt;<i> asset id) and the new script asset are stored locally.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If a user takes the prim into their inventory, we need to pass to the 
</I>&gt;<i> grid the asset id holding the serialized aspects of the prim.  If this 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't exist on the grid asset server, the grid will need to make a 
</I>&gt;<i> request for that asset to the local region asset server.  It will need 
</I>&gt;<i> to deserialize this data and make requests in turn for any of the prim 
</I>&gt;<i> inventory asset ids it's missing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe the major cost of this scheme is that associated with the 
</I>&gt;<i> [de]serialization of the prim.  I've thought through a few alternative 
</I>&gt;<i> proposals which avoid this by establishing task inventory tables and the 
</I>&gt;<i> like, but these all seem to become rapidly quite complicated as one 
</I>&gt;<i> tries to account for things such as prims which exist inside themselves 
</I>&gt;<i> and the reuse of item inventory entries (so that identical items don't 
</I>&gt;<i> end up unnecessarily duplicating inventory structures).  The 
</I>&gt;<i> serialization scheme has the wonderful virtue of simplicity (assuming it 
</I>&gt;<i> works :-).
</I>
I think that if you specify a parent_id relationship, you can do this
pretty easily and recursively in tables in a reasonable way.  Having a
seperate parent_child inventory table will work reasonably well here as
well.  Perhaps if I have a few examples I can propose table models and
queries that will give you what you want here.

The inventory normalization (keeping a minimum number of inventory
items) needs to be thought of carefully, because unless they are
no-moddify, you will need to make copies at some point.  Delayed copy
might save some storage, but may make the code much more complicated.

&gt;<i> The local asset server scheme also potentially allows somebody running 
</I>&gt;<i> many regions in one location to centralize their persistent region 
</I>&gt;<i> storage into one database, which could aid administration, backup, 
</I>&gt;<i> availability, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments/suggestions/brickbats, please.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
