<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Following some IRC conversations with MW, I've been thinking about how 
we might implement persistent prim inventories (i.e. task inventories, 
as the associated packets are called).  Here is my initial proposal on 
the issue for OpenSim 0.6.  In the spirit of iterative, open source 
development, this is probably not the most optimal design but rather an 
attempt to identify a basic way of doing it now that won't cause time 
consuming problems down the road.

As MW has outlined, there are two aspects involved in implementing 
persistent prim inventories - persisting them in an avatar's inventory 
and persisting them in a region.

I propose that in both of these cases we store the prim's inventory as 
part of its XML serialization, which I believe is stored as an asset 
when a prim (or prim group) is taken into an avatar's inventory.  
Metadata about items in the prim's inventory (name, permissions, etc) 
would be stored as part of the serialization.  However, all assets 
within that inventory (other prims as well as data such as scripts and 
textures) would be stored as separate assets and linked to the 
serialization by asset id.

I believe this will work without too many changes for the avatar 
inventory, since an asset server is already available in both standalone 
and grid modes.  The same asset server is also available locally to a 
region in standalone mode.  However, I expect it would be a bad idea to 
fetch assets from the grid asset server every time a grid mode region 
started up - both in terms of unscalable load and bandwidth costs.

So I would propose that as part of the implementation of persistent prim 
inventories, we need a local asset server that acts largely as a cache 
for the grid asset server.  When a prim is initially rezzed to a region, 
the only additional data other than that which we should supply already 
(name, description, etc), is the asset id representing the serialized 
parts of the prim. (Actually, I suspect that we're serializing things 
such as name and description which we arguably shouldn't be - as 
evidenced by the fact that if I change the name of a prim in inventory 
and rerez it, it comes back with the name it had when I originally took 
it from the region).

On receiving the asset ID, the region immediately makes a request to its 
local server asset cache for the serialized data in order to run any 
scripts in the prim inventory.  If the asset is not found locally, then 
the request goes out to the grid server.  Once the grid server supplies 
the asset, it can be cached persistently locally (as assets never change).

Once the asset is received by the original region calling code, it's 
deserialized and loaded into memory.  The asset ids contained within the 
prim inventory can be requested as required.

If any of the metadata for those contents changes, then a new serialized 
asset is stored locally.  If any of the prim contents change (e.g. a 
script is updated), then both the contents information (with the new 
asset id) and the new script asset are stored locally.

If a user takes the prim into their inventory, we need to pass to the 
grid the asset id holding the serialized aspects of the prim.  If this 
doesn't exist on the grid asset server, the grid will need to make a 
request for that asset to the local region asset server.  It will need 
to deserialize this data and make requests in turn for any of the prim 
inventory asset ids it's missing.

I believe the major cost of this scheme is that associated with the 
[de]serialization of the prim.  I've thought through a few alternative 
proposals which avoid this by establishing task inventory tables and the 
like, but these all seem to become rapidly quite complicated as one 
tries to account for things such as prims which exist inside themselves 
and the reuse of item inventory entries (so that identical items don't 
end up unnecessarily duplicating inventory structures).  The 
serialization scheme has the wonderful virtue of simplicity (assuming it 
works :-).

The local asset server scheme also potentially allows somebody running 
many regions in one location to centralize their persistent region 
storage into one database, which could aid administration, backup, 
availability, etc.

Comments/suggestions/brickbats, please.
