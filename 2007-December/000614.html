<PRE>So I began the process of going back to using non-hyphenated Strings by 
establishing a conversion method in Util and changing the sqlite 
database storage (r2775, r2776).  A couple of things struck me.

1.  Is it, in fact, more sensible to get some method for doing this on 
LLUUID itself (ToStringRaw())?  Doing it this way is very non-OO, 
although might be better if you think such methods should live outside 
of the objects themselves.

2.  I notice, at least in MySQL and SQLlite, that all the database 
tables could already handle uuid strings with 36 characters (the asset 
table being the notable exception).  Are we better off keeping the code 
as is and asking users to manually convert their databases if they want 
to retain their data?  Downside: user conversion &amp; ToString() remains, 
as well as some conversion work.  Upside: potentially Path Of Least 
Resistance, fewer introduced bugs in the conversion process.

This option still requires some manual change (e.g. to Inventory code 
which hardcodes initial UUIDs) and needs the binary 16 id store of the 
Asset table to expand to 18.
