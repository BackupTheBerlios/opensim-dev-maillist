<PRE>It's true that the TextureEntry/TextureFace will probably mean a lot of duplicated xml, but I don't think we have any choice in the short and long run; storing them as a bin field will expose us to the compatibility issues from hell, as well as taking away all the benefits of using xml in the first place (machine and human readability etc)
 
We are definitively not going to store the very textures in the xml if that was what you were worried by.We definitively need to be able to revise the xml schema between versions; 0.5 should incorporate text storing of TextureEntry.
 
Using xml for backing up more than a couple of prims is, and will always be, suboptimal however you look at it; it's main use should be transport of one or a few object groups. Something else, like database dumps, should be used for backups.

If the Texture Data is encapsulated within the XML file it would lead to very large XML files with repetitive data. Perhaps a dual strategy here? Command line option to include the TextureEntry and data within the XML, or write the geometry and texture all to a single directory. Loading would use the same scheme. Brief outline: Form 1-         save-xml file &lt;xml-file&gt;                 This form saves everything in a single XML file. This is useful for data warehousing that requires single entry = single file. Form 2-         save-xml dir &lt;dir-spec&gt;                 This form saves as in example below:                         save-xml dir /home/opensim/builds/myhouse                 /home/opensim/builds/myhouse  (directory containing):                         myhouse.xml                         texture001.jp2                         texture002.jp2                                ... Form 3-         save-xml backup                 This form saves everything into the profile specified backup filespec. Using a standardized form (likely Form 1) Thoughts?

Well Load/Save xml are working, its just that the format of the xml for LLUUID, LLVector3 and LLQuaternion have changed. So if you do a save-xml now and then try to load it, it should work. But trying to load a old xml file won't. So it depends if we need to make sure those old files work, if we spend time &quot;fixing&quot; it. Maybe we should take this chance to break other things too. Like Stephan said, we should get TextureEntry into a readable form. There are a few other changes we might want to make to. As we are coming up to version 0.5 we could say 0.5 load/save-xml is not compatible with 0.4 files.

On the short list of new features is: * Physics (ODE is impressively stable at this point)* Grid Mode (though there are still some asset issues)* Animations* IM, IRC Bridge* Terraforming* Throttling (though not a user facing feature)(I'm sure I've missed some, please respond with other new features)It seems like we should pick a couple of things that would be good to&quot;finish off&quot; this month, then declare a 0.5 release around the first of the year.My inclination is to say that bandaiding up current grid asset /inventory to functioning state would be in that short list.
