<PRE>At this point we have some life breathed back into the prototype scripting engine and a few of the ll-functions in LSL_BuiltIn_Commands.cs have been verified to work again. These are the simple ones like llSay().

In moving forward with testing, I am trying to suggest to our users on the #opensim that we get multiple verifications on at least 4 computers, two on Windows and two on Linux that each of the existing 80 functions are truly working and that others can get the same results.

As expected, the prevalent opinion is &quot;Need more features, testing old stuff is boring&quot;.

So, any help the group can give in re-inforcing *some* semblance of getting multiple users to test on multiple platforms would be appreciated.

We have about 80 or so of the 300+ functions implemented and these are the easy ones. We should strive to add patches for at least another 80 or so before we enable the texture animation as I suspect the day the water flows in the fountain on &quot;Wright Plaza&quot;, there will be a great rush to scripting.

So, I am also soliciting a little help in getting 80 more LSL functions implemented in the LSL_BuiltIn_Commands.cs file.

It has been suggested that this file may rapidly grow to too many lines, and I understand. Somewhere along the way, we will need to probably break it up into two logical pieces. Currently, I am thinking along the lines of &quot;get&quot; functions in one file and &quot;set&quot; functions in a different, related file. Perhaps with names like LLGetFunctions.cs and LLSetFunctions.cs.

I am soliciting opinions for this strategy and support in moving scripting forward a little bit, carefully.
