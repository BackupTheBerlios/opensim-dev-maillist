<PRE>Actually, the 'real' oo approach would be to subclass SceneObjectGroup and -Part, to create 'intelligent objects' as I think SimpleApp once described. (Not sure of the state of the SimpleApp)

You are correct.&gt; &gt; The issue that exists is more one of &quot;how does one think about the&gt; problem?&quot;, though.&gt; &gt; With scripts on primitives, you have an object-oriented approach (the&gt; object contains the mechanism for interaction with the object). With&gt; the Region Module interface, you have a completely separate, much more&gt; procedural or functional approach (depending on how it's implemented)&gt; -- the objects are acted on by a mechanism extrinsic to the object,&gt; the data that describe the object and how the sim and client and agent&gt; all interact with it managed by a set of routines that reach their&gt; noodly appendages into the action of the scene.&gt; &gt; (er, sorry for the Flying Spaghetti Monster reference.)&gt; &gt; For someone who's used to working with the object-oriented approach,&gt; it's very difficult to think in a procedural context. For someone&gt; who's used to working in a procedural approach, it's very difficult to&gt; think in an object-oriented context. And for someone who's used to&gt; working in LSL, C# is a whole new ball of wax.&gt; &gt; I appreciate that everyone is looking at it from a &quot;well, this isn't&gt; done yet, but you can work around the lack of it by using this other&gt; thing that can do the same types of things only differently&quot; view, and&gt; I appreciate the willingness to offer workarounds for incomplete&gt; functionality. I'm just not sure that the workaround can be&gt; implemented by everyone. ;)&gt; &gt; -Kyle H&gt; &gt; On Dec 16, 2007 9:54 AM, Sean Dague &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">sean at dague.net</A>&gt; wrote:&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; However, the point that Stefan was making is, given that you have full&gt; &gt; source access to the simulator, and the Region Module interface is&gt; &gt; reasonably well defined, you can do this at a sim layer right now,&gt; &gt; giving yourself more access to the environment in the process.&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
