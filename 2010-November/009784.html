<PRE>Many thanks to all the helpful responses, it certainly gives me a few 
things to look into over the next few days.

WRT collaborations/Google Groups/open source/etc., the project is an 
ongoing final year university project &amp; as such there is no scope for 
such things at the moment (as I would be accused of cheating!). However 
upon completion it may well be released open source &amp; possibly continued 
into a PhD (if I can secure funding), at which point I would probably be 
actively seeking collaboration.

It's interesting that one of you should mention DMX512, as I actually 
work with a lot of DMX512 lighting equipment (as much as 125A worth) in 
my spare time &amp; hadn't even thought of such a combination with opensim!

Regards,
CJ Davise
