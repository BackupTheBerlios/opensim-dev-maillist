<PRE>As a minimum the OpenSimulator project should form an LLC if only to
have a &quot;foil&quot; to protect contributors from lawsuit/&quot;patent&quot; predators! 

That is exactly what an LLC is designed to do!

In Arizona an LLC can be formed for US$120 and I would be happy to do
the paperwork if there is a consensus on this ( I have formed a total of
8 LLCs, although I am NOT an Attorney. I am a &quot;Patent Agent&quot;, but that
ONLY applies to patents.)

&gt;<i> We have been discussing these issues internally for a while. The main  
</I>&gt;<i> issue, from an organizational perspective, is that the project is not  
</I>&gt;<i> part of any official organization, and, as such, cannot take signed  
</I>&gt;<i> contributors' agreements that would do away with the strict  
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions that we have in place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that these restrictions are in place for a very good reason:  
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim is very close to one company's product, Second Life, and works  
</I>&gt;<i> with their GPL client. However, the license is BSD; we don't want to  
</I>&gt;<i> put people's businesses in danger by risking claims that there is code  
</I>&gt;<i> in here that comes from a GPL project. That's the reason why these  
</I>&gt;<i> very restrictive policies are in place: we're protecting the  
</I>&gt;<i> businesses that are emerging on top of the platform.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even though we all believe that Linden Lab would never do anything to  
</I>&gt;<i> harass the OpenSim community, we are more cautious about Linden Lab's  
</I>&gt;<i> next owner, assuming the likely possibility that LL will be acquired.  
</I>&gt;<i> There are a lot of sharks out there...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, not withstanding the LGPL issue, which I agree changes things a  
</I>&gt;<i> little bit, the best way out of these restrictions once and for all is  
</I>&gt;<i> for us to form an official non-profit organization. That will allow  
</I>&gt;<i> that organization to receive signed contributors' agreements saying  
</I>&gt;<i> that their contributions are, indeed, original -- even if they have  
</I>&gt;<i> been involved in viewer development. Such agreements move the  
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility to the individual contributors, instead of affecting  
</I>&gt;<i> the project as a whole, as it is now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are moving in that direction.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, there is nothing preventing groups of people from forming  
</I>&gt;<i> development teams that have less restrictive policies. Risk is in the  
</I>&gt;<i> eye of the beholder...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There has been a number of blog posts and descriptions recently of  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developments of OpenSim that seek to extend and solidify some of the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; results of the core developments.  This is great.  Diversity and  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rapid cycles of innovation is what a vibrant development community  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needs.  But we need to encourage some of the very best results of  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these efforts do find their way back to core and shared developments  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that benefit all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Reading the blog entries of these developments, it seems that a big  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issue is our lack of clarity of the policy on excluding those who  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have also been involved in developments of the viewers under the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; previously restrictive licence terms, and a clear mechanism for  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extending OpenSim beyond core modules t0 those things essential to  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make a useful environment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A few examples include:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     <A HREF="http://sanctuary.psmxy.org/2010/10/31/18/introducing-aurora/">http://sanctuary.psmxy.org/2010/10/31/18/introducing-aurora/</A>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     <A HREF="http://www.meta7.com/">http://www.meta7.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The recent move of the Linden labs viewer licence to Lesser GPL is  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; critical and completely removes the need to be restrictive on that  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; score.  For over 20 years all developments in my group have been  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lesser GPL to encourage really widespread and unrestricted take up  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the results.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can I suggest that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a) The Dev group now discuss this and immediately declare that the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; previous restriction on excluding developers who have seen LL viewer  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source code is removed due to the LGPL licence now in effect.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; b) That we adopt an approach that encourages inputs of elements and  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usability extensions (via optional modules) that are under LGPL or a  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suitable Creative Commons Licence.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
