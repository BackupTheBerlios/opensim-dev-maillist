<PRE>We're not lawyers either. That's why the project has consulted with 
lawyers for this. The rules originally came from IBM legal (if I'm not 
mistaken, although I wasn't here when that happened) and from a lawyer 
based in San Diego who has recently reinforced the need for them, again. 
He explained the options to move beyond them, and that's the advice that 
we are following.

</I>&gt;<i> lifetime of its business demonstrated an intent to form a community of 
</I>&gt;<i> consumers and set the terms for that consumption, and having done so, 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot turn on that community and prosecute for consumption in kind.

</I>&gt;<i> support it since the beginning, and cannot now turn on it and 
</I>&gt;<i> prosecute it for existing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This precedent of law also applies to those who might purchase LL - 
</I>&gt;<i> and while they may be quite disinterested in continuing support of 
</I>&gt;<i> that preexisting community (and are in fact under no obligation to do 
</I>&gt;<i> so), they cannot change the past relationship and cannot pursue legal 
</I>&gt;<i> actions over it, or prevent the continued use of that which has 
</I>&gt;<i> already left the lab on a promotional basis (e.g., the viewer source 
</I>&gt;<i> and the communications protocols). LL have long maintained that they 
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to produce 'the next HTML' for the '3d web'. That, coupled with 
</I>&gt;<i> the open release of the viewer tech and protocols, are a fairly clear 
</I>&gt;<i> presentation of intent.

</I>&gt;<i>     We have been discussing these issues internally for a while. The
</I>&gt;<i>     main issue, from an organizational perspective, is that the
</I>&gt;<i>     project is not part of any official organization, and, as such,
</I>&gt;<i>     cannot take signed contributors' agreements that would do away
</I>&gt;<i>     with the strict restrictions that we have in place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Note that these restrictions are in place for a very good reason:
</I>&gt;<i>     OpenSim is very close to one company's product, Second Life, and
</I>&gt;<i>     works with their GPL client. However, the license is BSD; we don't
</I>&gt;<i>     want to put people's businesses in danger by risking claims that
</I>&gt;<i>     there is code in here that comes from a GPL project. That's the
</I>&gt;<i>     reason why these very restrictive policies are in place: we're
</I>&gt;<i>     protecting the businesses that are emerging on top of the platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Even though we all believe that Linden Lab would never do anything
</I>&gt;<i>     to harass the OpenSim community, we are more cautious about Linden
</I>&gt;<i>     Lab's next owner, assuming the likely possibility that LL will be
</I>&gt;<i>     acquired. There are a lot of sharks out there...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So, not withstanding the LGPL issue, which I agree changes things
</I>&gt;<i>     a little bit, the best way out of these restrictions once and for
</I>&gt;<i>     all is for us to form an official non-profit organization. That
</I>&gt;<i>     will allow that organization to receive signed contributors'
</I>&gt;<i>     agreements saying that their contributions are, indeed, original
</I>&gt;<i>     -- even if they have been involved in viewer development. Such
</I>&gt;<i>     agreements move the responsibility to the individual contributors,
</I>&gt;<i>     instead of affecting the project as a whole, as it is now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     We are moving in that direction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Of course, there is nothing preventing groups of people from
</I>&gt;<i>     forming development teams that have less restrictive policies.
</I>&gt;<i>     Risk is in the eye of the beholder...

</I>&gt;<i>         There has been a number of blog posts and descriptions
</I>&gt;<i>         recently of developments of OpenSim that seek to extend and
</I>&gt;<i>         solidify some of the results of the core developments.  This
</I>&gt;<i>         is great.  Diversity and rapid cycles of innovation is what a
</I>&gt;<i>         vibrant development community needs.  But we need to encourage
</I>&gt;<i>         some of the very best results of these efforts do find their
</I>&gt;<i>         way back to core and shared developments that benefit all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Reading the blog entries of these developments, it seems that
</I>&gt;<i>         a big issue is our lack of clarity of the policy on excluding
</I>&gt;<i>         those who have also been involved in developments of the
</I>&gt;<i>         viewers under the previously restrictive licence terms, and a
</I>&gt;<i>         clear mechanism for extending OpenSim beyond core modules t0
</I>&gt;<i>         those things essential to make a useful environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         A few examples include:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         The recent move of the Linden labs viewer licence to Lesser
</I>&gt;<i>         GPL is critical and completely removes the need to be
</I>&gt;<i>         restrictive on that score.  For over 20 years all developments
</I>&gt;<i>         in my group have been Lesser GPL to encourage really
</I>&gt;<i>         widespread and unrestricted take up of the results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Can I suggest that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         a) The Dev group now discuss this and immediately declare that
</I>&gt;<i>         the previous restriction on excluding developers who have seen
</I>&gt;<i>         LL viewer source code is removed due to the LGPL licence now
</I>&gt;<i>         in effect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         b) That we adopt an approach that encourages inputs of
</I>&gt;<i>         elements and usability extensions (via optional modules) that
</I>&gt;<i>         are under LGPL or a suitable Creative Commons Licence.
