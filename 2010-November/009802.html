<PRE>Hi Liam! and welcome :)

First things first - that page you reference is more than a bit out of date.
That said, there's still quite a bit of LSL that isn't entirely functional.
Most things work, or work in part. Such things that don't work or aren't
implemented are in many instances complimented by OpenSim additions to LSL,
aka the osFunctions() of which there are very nearly as many as there are
canonical LSL functions.

A direct answer concerning your questions with respect to the scripting API:

Yes, you *can* access simulator internals using C# - this is done in one of
two ways, either by the employment of a 'generic' simulator module known as
MRM (Mini Region Modules) which are essentially prim-hosted C# programs.
This module is standard issue with stock opensim, though it too has a few
missing features - sandboxing to allow semi-anonymous users to script prims
in C# for instance. For the most part, I suspect that such limitations will
not provide you with significant constraints in your application area.

Speaking of region modules, MRM gives us an excellent opportunity to seguey
into canonical region modules - essentially simulator plugins, these can be
employed in extending the functionality of a simulator in directions limited
only by the imagination and coding skills.

I hope I have provided adequate answers to your questions - and if you have
further questions, please feel free to contact me either on this list or at

Good luck and cheers!

</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, it's noted that there are a few LSL functions unimplemented. I

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to understand the pieces here ...
</I>&gt;<i> Does Xengine provide OpenSim with only LSL functionality or does it enable

</I>&gt;<i> of the other languages save LSL) have a special &quot;in&quot; to OpenSim for which
</I>&gt;<i> LSL is just an abstraction layer?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider this: I would think OpenSim generates some kind movement related
</I>&gt;<i> event or events. Not unlike separate key-down/key-up events being tracked
</I>&gt;<i> and then molded into a third event - key-press - I would assume something
</I>&gt;<i> similar is happening within OpenSim, that these internal happenings
</I>&gt;<i> eventually bubble up into a single LSL moving_start event. Does C# (or other
</I>&gt;<i> supported language) have such deep access to OpenSim thereby allowing me to
</I>&gt;<i> craft my own &quot;moving start&quot; event (handler)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would switch from Second Life to OpenSim/OSGrid immediately if I knew
</I>&gt;<i> there was some way to fully replicate Second Life script functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> (Emphasis on functionality; it does *not* have to be copy/paste of LSL.) I
</I>&gt;<i> don't care if I have to rewrite everything in C# (or, shudder, VB.Net). Six
</I>&gt;<i> years in Second Life - and now supporting a higher-ed institution's use -
</I>&gt;<i> has left me with *quite a lot* of scripted objects. Before I migrate
</I>&gt;<i> everything, I'd like to know it's possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
