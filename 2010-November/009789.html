Lo-fi public visualization in OpenSim is an interest of mine.  There has been some interesting stuff done via scripting 
on the Linden grid but I think there's also a lot of potential for the server-side approach (because of the advantages 
outlined previously).

In fact, next year I hope to improve the documentation and facilities in this area, since I think it has the potential 
to enable a lot of stuff.  Documentation, testing and patches will be much appreciated!

In the meantime, if there are any questions about manipulating OpenSim from the region module side please feel free to 
ask and I will do my best to answer them, time and knowledge permitting.  I have good knowledge of how to do certain 
things on master and 0.7.0.2 and less the further back you go in release time.
