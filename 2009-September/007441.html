<PRE>Unfortunately I have a broken 0.6.3 system (Grid, UGAIM and 12 
regions on single server) with my user server crashing whenever we 
connect an SL client (though it continues to run without the user 
server), so we do have to move on.  We had planned a fresh start at 
some stage anyway, and plan a complete fresh Grid system, and the 
load the old content back through the 12 saved OARs for each 
region.  We left all inventory for avatars in boxes on the land to 
help the process.

I have spent the last while looking at the various docs and 
understating the (RO)BUST replacement of the AI servers.

Question 1) Is 0.6.6 already UG(R)M and needs the new .ini and 
architecture sections to be set up, or should we wait a bit longer?

Question 2) Do we have a reliable UPGRADE mechanism for working 
systems with the new setup... it took a login time to establish a 
reliable way to do that for the various modes for earlier releases 
you may recall.  But I guess all the documentation on that is now obsolete?

We are happy to try to get this sorted out and document our 
experience and the tested update process for the wiki when we know 
the route.  A few guidance point from the dev team would help and 
avoid us wasting time though.  Thanks folks, Ai
