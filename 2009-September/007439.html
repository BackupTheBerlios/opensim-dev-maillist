<PRE>I'm running 25 regions and plan to ad an additional 25 by November.  I
completely gave up on trying to figure out 0.6.6 since there was no useful
documentation for it.

I still run 0.6.5.1 and it has continued to perform for me without any
issues.

I now understand why IT departments wait a few years (often) before adopting
an upgrade to Windows, for example.

Wait til all the bugs are out before adopting the upgrade.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Opensim-dev] Opensim.ini and the various config files
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just to feed back on a bit of experience.. that may be worth bearing
</I>&gt;<i> in mind for our user base.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have had an Opensim setup for about 2 years - initially
</I>&gt;<i> standalone, then grid, then standalone multi-region and grid
</I>&gt;<i> multi-region for last year or so.  Its been working fine when I
</I>&gt;<i> regularly updated it every few weeks, which I did up to march this
</I>&gt;<i> year.  I could stay on top of the various changes to config file and
</I>&gt;<i> the now VERY complex Opensim.ini, XCML config files, changing region
</I>&gt;<i> XML file content, and opensim.exe parameters that were needed by
</I>&gt;<i> keeping abreast of the blogs and dev mailing list (especially
</I>&gt;<i> Justincc'e weekly blog is most helpful for this).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I tried once or twice about 2 months ago to see if I could update the
</I>&gt;<i> old system, but only managed to break it. with the User server now
</I>&gt;<i> stopping whenever I connect the SL viewer to iot fop all users on all
</I>&gt;<i> home and last locations I have tested.  I cannot see why that is
</I>&gt;<i> happening but decided to move on and get a NEW clean system and the
</I>&gt;<i> reimport the saved OARs we have for the old content.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I just returned to try to get an up to date Opensim setup (using
</I>&gt;<i> the 0.6.6 post fixes version) as a base.  I got a SQLLite standalone
</I>&gt;<i> working - though the master avatar wsa just a cloud. is that normal?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But trying to get a grid MySQL version back is proving hard. I just
</I>&gt;<i> spent an hour looking at the LONG Opensim.ini to see if I can spot
</I>&gt;<i> new things I need, and see the even more complicated [Architecture]
</I>&gt;<i> section at the end, which I guess I will have to work out and could
</I>&gt;<i> be the cause of the problems, as it seems to need changes fro grid
</I>&gt;<i> versions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But its proving REALLY difficult.  The Opensim.ini is now really
</I>&gt;<i> really complicated, and after 2 pretty much solid days of work, I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot get a grid setup to run on a single machine running UGAIM and
</I>&gt;<i> ONE region.. never mind the 12 we used to run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have some recent instructions on setting up in GRID mode
</I>&gt;<i> on a single server for MySQL and a working Opensim.ini and any other
</I>&gt;<i> config files I can copy and adapt to get this going?  Or general
</I>&gt;<i> advice if everyone is having similar problems with 0.6.6? I think I
</I>&gt;<i> have te UGAIM XML config files in good shape, as I deliberately
</I>&gt;<i> generated them afresh using the prompts the servers run through at
</I>&gt;<i> initial start up time, as I did not trust my old XML config files ot
</I>&gt;<i> be up to date.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any pointers much appreciates so I can make quicker progress.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This also means upgrades are presumably out of the question at this
</I>&gt;<i> stage of rapid developments in Opensim? is that the experience or are
</I>&gt;<i> you all managing to upgrade still with the old upgrade instuctions of:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) copy over the UGAIM XML config files (and region_settings.xml if
</I>&gt;<i> its customiszed)
</I>&gt;<i> b) insert your required changes in a NEW opensim.ini ecah time
</I>&gt;<i> c) copy your region xml files into the regions folder
</I>&gt;<i>
