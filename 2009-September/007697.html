This would be terrible. We're going in the opposite direction, which is 
to have a minimal core and let people do their own extensions as they 
wish, hopefully replacing the heck out of the reference implementations.

I think you, and maybe others here, may need to understand better this 
concept of extensible systems. That's at the very core of OpenSim from 
the beginning, even before I started contributing -- OpenSim is not an 
application, it's a platform with which to build applications.

Some extenders of OpenSim may want to get together and try to make their 
extensions work with each other. That's great and desirable. But let's 
not prevent innovative ideas from emerging by throwing a massive 
feature-full application out there as &quot;OpenSim&quot;.
