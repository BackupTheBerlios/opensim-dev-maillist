<PRE>I thought you asserted that the XML/RPC interface only applied to regions?  Maybe load oar is a bad example since it is region related. Let's say the iar inventory archive support was fully functional.  If I want an remote interface to that how should that be accomplished?

Personally I don't see the value in a simple text console but I wouldn't argue one shouldn't exist. And yes, for simply transporting command lines back and forth REST works reasonably well.

I think for me the confusion crept in here because the console currently is the primary way you administer an OpenSim server.  So when I say I want and RPC oriented administration interface (and I think others have chimed in with some agreement) I associated that with the console.  So let me rephrase.  What I really want is an RPC oriented admin interface into an OpenSim server/container. Then I can craft any UI I want (web form, Flash/FLEX, a command like utility that parses and sends commands, an ad-hoc python program I write to pull some data from a server), etc.  And I can run the server without requiring a text window be open (which you've already addressed, thanks for that!)

Hopefully that helps..

Mike

Again, here. Things like remotely loading OARs are best handled in 
the existing XMLRPC remote admin module. The REST console is only 
for text input/screen output.

</I>&gt;<i> My point is, if you want to make it easy for others to implement what is very likely an RPC like interface in the first place (which the console code is, IMO, it has &quot;commands&quot; that take parameters much like a function call/rpc call) then why not use XML/RPC in the first place and take advantage of the standardized wire format support and broad language support.
