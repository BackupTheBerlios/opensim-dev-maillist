<PRE>Since OSGrid office hours cover a lot of ground about what the latest
and greatest OpenSim code has to offer, I'm wondering if anyone would be
interested in a &quot;stable&quot; office hours meeting once a week to discuss
configuration changes between releases, known issues on each stable,
moving from one stable to another, etc. Those of us on stable get to
know a particular revision pretty well, and can hopefully help each
other move on a bit, while still keeping an eye on cutting edge
developments and upcoming improvements to come in future stable tags.

I would be happy to host regular meetings on ReactionGrid if anyone is
interested!

Chris

Subject: [Opensim-dev] 0.6.6 kind of working - except for inventory
access issues - and &quot;does not have root folder&quot; errors

Making progress.  I got 0.6.6 up with our old data base 0.6.3 data 
contents and 12 regions :-)

I can even log in with SL viewer 1.23, and except for a few 
attachments not still being attached (like hair on avatars!) it all 
looks quite reasonable.

But I am getting inventory access warning errors, and as soon as I 
open the user's inventory folder the SL viewer crashes.  I see errors 
in the opensim.exe console that the avatar does not have root folder

Before I start to delve deeper tomorrow, as it could be something 
silly with the IP addresses (all the same mac hone) or the data base 
access strings for MySQL, I just thought I would ask if this sound 
familiar to anyone and would appreciate any pointers.

Best wishes, Ai (another day gone !)
