<PRE>Tribal Server/TribalNet wasn't actually a fork, it was a just a set of extra modules. Some of them were replacements for standard modules included with opensim, while others were complete custom. The control panel was a two part thing, one being a Launcher panel which basically started the viewer and opensim. There was also a region admin panel which was just a region module. 

Any changes we did to the core of opensim were committed back by myself or Lbsa71.

And as Adam said, TribalNet and in fact Tribal Media no long exist. Although I don't think any of the code did get added to forge, unless Stefan did it and I didn't realise. The project we created on the forge was intended for the voice system (custom SLVoice.exe replacement and modified freeswitch) we did. But just after we created the project, the current freeswitch module was added to opensim, and as that makes it so you don't need the SLVoice..exe replacement, we never bothered releasing our code. 

All the rest of the code from TribalNet still exists in old backups, but is so out of date it would basically need rewriting to work with current opensim.

TribalServer fell into disrepair I believe, but MW &amp; LBSA
donated their unique features into a Forge project at least 6 months ago. (look
for &#8216;Tribal&#8217; in the projects list). 

 &#160; 

3Di is just OpenSim + a support contract + some extra modules
for the 3D models and analytics. I believe 3Di runs fairly close to OpenSim
releases, and they do donate code back to core which indicates they would have
to be. 

 &#160; 

RealXtend was probably the only really &#8216;fork fork&#8217; where the goal
was to do some things differently; but that got merged back last November, and
now you can run ModRex with OpenSim-trunk. (although sometimes compatibility
issues with the module do appear on new features, eg megaregions) 

 &#160; 

So, I don&#8217;t think there are any major forks anymore &#8211; 3Di would
be it if anything, and they aren&#8217;t that much of one.

 &#160; 

Diva, 



 &#160; 





There are/were quite a few
forks floating around out there. 



&gt;<i>&#160;What opensim forks are you talking about? I
</I>don't know of any, so&#160; 





&gt;<i> please&#160;point me to one. 
</I>




 &#160; 





<A HREF="http://3di-opensim.com/en/">http://3di-opensim.com/en/</A> 





 &#160; 





You've never heard of 3Di OpenSim Enterprise? 





 &#160; 





<A HREF="http://virtualeconomicforum.com/content-library/blogging/about/3di_to_sell_opensim_server_software/">http://virtualeconomicforum.com/content-library/blogging/about/3di_to_sell_opensim_server_software/</A> 





 &#160; 





I can think of maybe 4 forks just off the top of my head.
&#160;I believe &quot;Tribal Media Server&quot; (or Tribal Net) and &quot;3Di
Server&quot; and RealXtend/ModRex were all forks based on the original OpenSim
core? 





 &#160; 





I understand that RealXtend came back from being a separate
fork, and RealXtend has now integrated their work back into OpenSim as a module
(ModRex). &#160;I believe Adam Frisby helped with converting RealXtend into a
&quot;ModRex&quot; module, but what about &quot;3Di Server&quot; and
&quot;Tribal Media Server&quot;? &#160;Are those not separate OpenSim-based
forks?&#160; 





 &#160; 





I understand that each of these OpenSim-based Server
&quot;forks&quot; uses different technologies (realXtend/ModRex supports
Ogre3D, and 3Di Server supports Irrlicht, etc.) &#160;I'm not quite sure what
Tribal Media Server is (but it seems to have been OpenSim-based fork as well
that seemed to have a nice Admin Control panel). 





 &#160; 





I believe &quot;Tribal Server&quot; or &quot;Tribal
Net&quot; was the name of Tribal Media's Server. &#160;I believe it was a fork
off of the original OpenSim core as well. 





 &#160; 







<A HREF="http://www.ugotrade.com/2008/05/14/tribal-media-changing-the-game-with-opensim/">http://www.ugotrade.com/2008/05/14/tribal-media-changing-the-game-with-opensim/</A> 





 &#160; 







I believe Tribal Media's Server (Tribal Server) had a really
nice Admin Control Panel, and an easy way to get Tribal Sim servers online. 





 &#160; 





As for 3Di server, I believe it supports
&quot;Irrlicht&quot; 3D rendering engine. &#160;(ModRex/RealXtend support
Ogre3d rendering engine). 





 &#160; 





I don't know all the exact specifics as to each of the
various different server forks, but I know much of RealXtend's work has been
integrated back into OpenSim (as a ModRex module), but 3Di and Tribal Media
servers (as far as I know) are not OpenSource, and have not had their work put
back into OpenSim. 





 &#160; 





I don't know all the specifics as to the exact differences
between all the various server forks, but it would be nice to create a wiki
page, showing a nice comparison chart between Tribal Media Server, 3Di
Enterprise Server, ModRex, and the native OpenSim Core. 





 &#160; 





Just so people can see what features each of the various
servers (such as 3Di Enterprise Server, or Tribal Media Server, or ModRex) has.
&#160;They all seem to be OpenSim-based. &#160;I understand RealXtend is now
&quot;ModRex&quot; (as an OpenSim module) but it used to be an OpenSim fork. 





 &#160; 





It would just be nice to know what features are in 3Di
Enterprise Server, and Tribal Media Server. &#160;(and maybe see a nice
comparison chart on the wiki page showing each of the features between each of
the various OpenSim-based servers). 





 &#160; 





Ultimately, I'd really love to see some of the work from 3Di
and Tribal Media contributed back (as OpenSource) to the OpenSim Community (as
open source modules for the OpenSim core), just as RealXtend has done (with
ModRex). 





 &#160;
