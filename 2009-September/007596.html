<PRE>Heho,


+1 for a new structured website

While self organized anarchical process tend to bring good results and new
ideas, they lack where it comes to the needs of people not involveld in the
process, e.g. documentation, GUI, quality mgmt etc..  opensim has a lot of
information on the website, but finding something is awefull. 

While I got more it-pro&#180;s and biz-owner interested in feb/march/april... we
seem have to been making so much improvements (aka changes), that they got
frustrated  -  documentation, release management , how-to&#180;s are big
problem.s

On the other hand, the fact was discussed from time to time and I would
think we just lack of volunteers for this housekeeping.

+1 for a CMS
+100 for one, that supports usual WYSIWYG-Editors.  

We run a web mag - and one of the biggest problem for us is, to make
different authors comfortable with input tools and keep almost same style to
the pages.   System which support common API&#180;s, and e.g. offer to user
Windows Live Writer on Win-Platform make it easier to create and edit
articles.



Cheers,
Ralf

Since there's long talk about this:

I would like to start by giving out an announcement about the
OpenSimulator website that some people have been saying the last
months:

&quot;What the heck is this website, what does it do and where's the info&quot;

After I heard this over and over again, we started the Wiki Hours on
Wright Plaza on Osgrid only to hear that about everyone thinks the
same about the website.

Talking in the opensim-dev channel made me realise that it's time to
grab the bull with its horns and submit a request/suggestion to all
the questions asked.

Request to make the website OpenSimulator.org a new site:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------

* Make the current wiki a readonly version under /oldwiki

* Make a new webpage for the OpenSimulator website

** This can easily be made in Drupal or any other CMS system

* Add a new Wiki to the website that has the latest plugins and
MediaWiki version

* Check the old wiki for things that are recent enough to transport to
the new Wiki and transport them

In the opensim-dev channel was also the suggestion to add a new
category to the Mantis &quot;Documentation&quot; and that ppl can add Mantises
about things that need documentation.

Further: I am suggesting that there are going to be policies to abide
by (especially thanks to teravus to mention this)

Please reply on this request with a +1 or a -1 and explain why, how
you see this.
