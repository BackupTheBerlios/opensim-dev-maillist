<PRE>Jason,
Still not working.  Please don't be offended, but it really might be best to
stop beating up the Open-Sim Dev list with your attempts at trying to set up
your own personal blog.

It might be best to spend a few weeks (or a few months) working out all the
bugs, and getting things up and running on your own first, then write a few
good OpenSim tutorials, post some really good OpenSim content, and then when
you have lots of wonderful content to share, then just post ONE single post
to the Dev-List if you're just looking for some traffic.

I've already read about 8 or 9 posts already to the whole Dev list, and I've
even tried to visit the empty shell of a site that you've been thinking
about creating or starting, but it seems to be down most of the time, and
it's a vanilla Joomla template, with no content, and absolutely nothing
about OpenSim, and certainly isn't anything impressive.  It doesn't even
seem to be working at this point in time.

So please before you begin beating up the Dev-list, at least take the time
(and effort) to spend a few months getting your site up and running first,
publish some really good content to your site and write up some really good
OpenSim tutorials, and maybe post a few really good demo regions (for others
to use/and download) with some good objects and content or something really
good that will draw some traffic to your site, before beating up the Dev
lists.

There are plenty of OpenSim blogs already out there with good tutorials and
content already.  Jani's site comes to mind (Cybertechnews.com) and
Cybertechnews has plenty of news and tutorials about OpenSim already.

You may want to start focusing more of your energy on contributing to a site
that is already up and running like Jani's, instead of starting completely
from scratch, or maybe just post your tutorials to the OpenSim wiki site
which is certainly where most people go to look for information and
tutorials on OpenSim anyways.

If you have tutorials then maybe you may want to consider contributing to
Jani's site
( www.cybertechnews.com), which has been up and running for quite some time
or maybe focus your energy on posting your tutorials to the OpenSim wiki
pages.  The OpenSim wiki certainly does need a lot of work, and it might be
a better place to post some of your work (if you actually have any
tutorials), but the Open-Sim Dev list probably isn't a good place to post or
Troll for blog or website hits.

Jason, we all got the point, and we all understand that you're trying to
look for traffic or start a new website.  That's very noble of you, but if
you plan on writing some tutorials, or plan on posting some good OpenSim
content, you may want to really try and post the content to the OpenSim wiki
which seems to be the first place that people look for OpenSim tutorials and
help.

The OpenSim (or RealXtend) wiki pages always seem to need some help and
work.  If you're going to start yet another blog, that's fine, but at least
get things up and running (and working) first, and spend a few months
posting some really good daily content, before posting or beating up the
Dev-list.  Also it might be good to post your tutorials to the OpenSim wiki
pages as well, as the OpenSim wiki is really the first place that most
people look for tutorials and help in getting started with OpenSim.
