<PRE>Good call; if nobody objects within a reasonable timeframe, I'm all +1 for
it as well.

you no longer need to rebuild ODE for 64 bit.. and about both ODE and
Meshmerizier +1 on both.  I would also like to extend this thread to ask
anyone who is using Basic Physics and Zeromesher, please let us know why you
are using it, thanks.

Justin,

The wiki still has sections indicating that some linux platforms may require
a rebuild of the ODE software.  This may be me mis-reading the wiki, or it
may be old info.
Because we run on 64 bit linux (Ubuntu 9.04 server), we do Mono and ODE
builds from source anyway.  It would seem, however, that if some of the
linux platforms will not run ODE &quot;out of the box&quot;, it may be a reason to
stick to the current default.  Im sorry I dont have any way to test and see
if the wiki information is outdated.

If ODE is made the default, please add some information to the wiki
documentation describing the configuration flags used to build it.  This may
provide the basis for discussions on the impact the build parameters have on
performance.  You may also want to note that using the ODE engine uses a LOT
more memory than the current defaults.

I really dont have a preference one way or the other, except to say that
having a 'default' configuration that works in the majority of installations
seems a better idea than one likely to trigger posts to forums complaining
about a &quot;more complicated&quot; setup.   Maybe the transition to ODE later
provides a &quot;built in&quot; delay for beginning administrators to get thier feet
wet, find out what they want to tweak, and might insure they look at the
wiki for directions :)

In the OpenSim developer's meeting yesterday on OSGrid we had a discussion
about
making ODE the default physics engine and Meshmerizer the default mesher.

Currently, basicphysics is the default physics engine but the general
response
was that everybody quickly switches to ODE since objects can only be phantom
under basicphysics.

The disadvantage with switching to ODE is that 64 bit Windows users would
have
to run bin/OpenSim.32BitLaunch.exe since there is currently no compilable 64
bit
Windows ODE (though there is a Linux one).

Everybody at the meeting felt that the advantages of going with ODE
outweighed
this disadvantage.  Does anybody on the list have a good reason for not
switching defaults?

As for meshing, ZeroMesher is currently the default.  However, this
implements
extremely basic meshing (non rotatable cubes).  In comparison, Meshmerizer
is
much more sophisticated.  There was strong feedback in the meeting that many
people quickly switch to Meshmerizer and that it would be good to make this
the
default.  Anybody have good counter-arguments to this?  I think there is
potentially some performance impact but users sophsticated enough to
encounter
that can always switch back to ZeroMesher.
