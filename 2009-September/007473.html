<PRE>Dear Chris:

I would encourage complementary, weekly meetings on Reaction Grid. Perhaps one could extend the idea a little bit and also encourage hypergridding logons from OSGrid to Reachtion Grid (and from Reaction Grid to OSGrid) to get more activity on hypergrid links between grids as part of this meeting.

Of course, I would also encourage an additional meeting or two on Wright Plaza or any of the other plazas on OSGrid for various activities and groups as we continue to push the stability and reliability of OpenSim regions. All of this is to our mutual advantage.


Charles

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] 0.6.6 kind of working - except for inventory access issues - and &quot;does not have root folder&quot; errors

Since OSGrid office hours cover a lot of ground about what the latest
and greatest OpenSim code has to offer, I'm wondering if anyone would be
interested in a &quot;stable&quot; office hours meeting once a week to discuss
configuration changes between releases, known issues on each stable,
moving from one stable to another, etc. Those of us on stable get to
know a particular revision pretty well, and can hopefully help each
other move on a bit, while still keeping an eye on cutting edge
developments and upcoming improvements to come in future stable tags.

I would be happy to host regular meetings on ReactionGrid if anyone is
interested!

Chris
