<PRE>The whole meta-point of opensim is that it is a framework that is easily 
extensible and configurable in a myriad of ways. It's not one system, 
it's a family of systems. The most similar case that comes to mind is 
Linux.

We have vaguely agreed some time ago to make the &quot;official&quot; distribution 
come prepackaged with two configurations for SQLite-standalones (one HG 
other not), and another two configurations for grided sims (HG and 
non-HG). So that's what comes in the package. It can't be made much 
easier than what it is, because the official distro MUST expose the 
dozens of configuration possibilities so that distribution-makers and 
application developers can choose among them.

As such, I would expect to see a variety of distributions popping up in 
the months to come that zoom in one certain things. OSGrid has been 
providing preconfigured binary distros for a long time. I think Rex 
provides their own too. The diva distro is another one, targeting one 
specific configuration -- HG standalones. And other people have 
mentioned theirs.

I don't think these distros need to be coordinated in any way. Anyone 
can make a distro available for whatever configuration(s) they like, for 
pay or for free, with whatever prepackaged goodies they want. Just keep 
the license there and honor it, that's all.
