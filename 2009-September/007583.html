<PRE>
&gt;<i>** This can easily be made in Drupal or any other CMS system
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* Add a new Wiki to the website that has the latest plugins and
</I>&gt;<i>MediaWiki version
</I>
+1 Drupal
+1 MediaWiki

Just to note that we also chose Drupal and MediaWiki (with single 
sign on between the two) for OpenVCE.net.  We have plug ins that 
allow connection to avatars and bogging and what not from wither 
Second Life or Opensim.  We would be happy to share any of this with 
Opensimulator if they make a site based on the same open sources bases.

See <A HREF="http://openvce.net">http://openvce.net</A>

We would like to make this allow for multiple avatars and virtual 
worlds, but currently its a single avatar link to each account, as 
the assumption is that its Se cod Life.. though the code is all 
designed to also work with Opensim except for avatar images (which 
use Linden Labs web services lookup).

We will also as soon as we can get the OpenVCE 3D assets and the 
Power[pint -&gt; PDF/Zip -&gt; web -&gt; in world screens presenter that are 
in Second Life now (from ourselves and Clever Zebra) over to Opensim 
(and possibly published as an OAR) as soon as we can.
