<PRE>Toni,

&gt;<i> Now I finally understand what you are after, after reading about x-plane 
</I>&gt;<i> on the net and your original message again..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> X-plane is a standalone non-networked app, a single player simulation. 
</I>&gt;<i> You want to make it networked, and consider using the OpenSim server for 
</I>&gt;<i> that?
</I>
yes. (actually, there are X-Plane networked plugins like that, that 
connect X-Plane to online sim networks like VATSIM, but the update 
frequency is very low in these implementations)

&gt;<i> The wording 'x-plane client' in your original post lead me to think that 
</I>&gt;<i> it already is a client-server architecture, and you have an existing 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol and some server implementation already etc.
</I>
sorry for not being clear in this regard.

&gt;<i> Well for the existing protocols to OpenSim there are several 
</I>&gt;<i> implementations. Most common one to write clients is LibOMV, which is a 
</I>&gt;<i> cleanroom SL(tm) compatible SLUDP implementation in c#. So it doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> compile to native code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In Realxtend Naali we have another from scratch implementation of that 
</I>&gt;<i> same protocol, written in C++. That might work for you. It's Apache 
</I>&gt;<i> (bsd-like) licensed. The web svn view to it is 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://dev.realxtend.org/gf/project/viewer/scmsvn/?action=browse&amp;path=/trunk/OpenSimProtocol/">http://dev.realxtend.org/gf/project/viewer/scmsvn/?action=browse&amp;path=/trunk/OpenSimProtocol/</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://dev.realxtend.org/gf/project/viewer/scmsvn/?action=browse&amp;path=/trunk/OpenSimProtocol/">http://dev.realxtend.org/gf/project/viewer/scmsvn/?action=browse&amp;path=/trunk/OpenSimProtocol/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A relevant part in the documentation is Interfacing with the OpenSim 
</I>&gt;<i> world using OSUDP message at 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.realxtend.org/doxygen/viewer/osudp.html">http://www.realxtend.org/doxygen/viewer/osudp.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can test how our new implementation works with the Naali 0.0.1 
</I>&gt;<i> developer preview we packaged in June, a main reason exactly to get 
</I>&gt;<i> feedback on how well the data transfer performs etc. Seems to work well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another native code implementation is funmv from 3di ('fun' for 
</I>&gt;<i> functional) which is iirc in c, i don't know if/where that's available 
</I>&gt;<i> nor much about it's usage (other than that it passes the packed data 
</I>&gt;<i> around unparsed, and the whoever needs some data can read that section 
</I>&gt;<i> from there, that being the func style).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course there is also the implementation in the Linden viewer if you 
</I>&gt;<i> are fine with the GPL license they use, I don't know anything about that 
</I>&gt;<i> except a guess based on rumours that it may not be very modular and 
</I>&gt;<i> easily usable for other apps, I don't know any app besides the slviewer 
</I>&gt;<i> and it's forks that uses that implementation.
</I>
thanks for the pointers - I'll give them a try!

&gt;<i> The MXP reference implementation is also C#, there is no C++ 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of it (yet).
</I>
I see..

&gt;<i> Yes. Like said I just thought you already had a protocol and existing 
</I>&gt;<i> clients for it that you wanted to support.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SLUDP is not an optimal generic VW protocol, not made for extensibility 
</I>&gt;<i> like google protocol buffers, but it works and there is a packet called 
</I>&gt;<i> GenericMessage which can be used to pass arbitrary information. That is 
</I>&gt;<i> what has been used in Realxtend so far to pass data which doesn't exist 
</I>&gt;<i> in the plain original protocol, and which may work for your usage too 
</I>&gt;<i> (for whatever metadata you need, and the trajectories etc).
</I>
Thanks - I'll take a look..

Kiitos huva!


Akos
