<PRE>Toni,

&gt;<i> Hm, trying to get what you are saying exactly .. are you saying this is 
</I>&gt;<i> something that applies to both the server and clients?
</I>
no, only the clients

&gt;<i> Where do you create the shared python objects? On either end, and then 
</I>&gt;<i> those are sent across and deserialized? I know how pickles work and how 
</I>&gt;<i> those can be used for sharing state, but am actually very surprised to 
</I>&gt;<i> hear that x-plane would use them in the protocol. I don't know 
</I>&gt;<i> basically anything about x-plane before.
</I>
maybe we have a misunderstanding of the term 'shared object'. I see you 
mean a serialized object which is marshalled through the network. I 
simply meant a dynamically linked library, called shared object in the 
UNIX world (extension usually .so or .dynlib on Mac, .dll on Windows)

basically the point is that one has to have a client library in 
languages that compile to native code, most preferably C and C++.

&gt;<i> Well I thought that if you write an x-plane protocol implementation as 
</I>&gt;<i> an OpenSim plugin, a XplaneClientView or something, it would support 
</I>&gt;<i> any client that talks that protocol. Like the SL, MXP and IRC 
</I>&gt;<i> ClientViews do support any compatible clients.
</I>
yes, but I don't see why I'd have to write a new protocol. why can't I 
just use existing ones? after all, the only information that would be 
send about is like: 'there's an object at this-and-that coordinate, 
heading this-and-that way', with some metadata like type, etc. isn't 
this what a virtual world environment would provide?

&gt;<i> For that it may not actually be much of a problem. As you can see in 
</I>&gt;<i> the viewers now, the horizon can span far. In ones that talk sl 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol the viewers can know about several regions at a time, so they 
</I>&gt;<i> can draw the neighbouring ones too, and they draw sky and sea etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> however they want of course.
</I>
sounds good..

&gt;<i> And there needs to be LOD (level of detail) systems for all usages, in 
</I>&gt;<i> many ways (for movement update detail amount, for 3d data resolution 
</I>&gt;<i> etc.).
</I>
yes..

&gt;<i> Again, I thought that this was about a server implementation, as 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim is a server platform / SDK, and that you'd use existing Xplane 
</I>&gt;<i> clients. Or do you mean that the server also communicates expected 
</I>&gt;<i> trajectories, so the client can draw based on the 'future' info too? 
</I>&gt;<i> Should be doable, if it's done elsewhere too..
</I>
yes, that's the idea

&gt;<i> Client side movement interpolation is implemented in the current 
</I>&gt;<i> viewers, even in our Realxtend Naal which in very early stages still 
</I>&gt;<i> (0.0.1 dev preview was published in June after 4 months of dev work, 
</I>&gt;<i> 0.0.2 is targeted in october or so and something like 0.1 perhaps by 
</I>&gt;<i> the end of the year). So I don't know how much of that you need on the 
</I>&gt;<i> server with xplane, but certainly sounds like something that flight 
</I>&gt;<i> servers could do .. and again very cool if they do.
</I>
yes, would be cool indeed..

&gt;<i> May be, could be tested .. I think they are floats, at least in our 
</I>&gt;<i> viewer, and floats are IIRC accurate near 1.0 .. hmhm well we can see, 
</I>&gt;<i> or someone wiser can tell, am too tired to do any math right now here.
</I>
:<i>) my experience is that when talking real world coordinates, one needs 
</I>double precision for sufficiently accurate positioning.

&gt;<i> Yes, both server and client need to be smart about that. Server to know 
</I>&gt;<i> what to send I guess, and client for what to draw (or what to request 
</I>&gt;<i> from server, when server can be dummier? Dunno, but there probably are 
</I>&gt;<i> solutions to this in places).
</I>
thanks, I'll look around..


Akos
