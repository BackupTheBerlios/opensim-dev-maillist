Thanks for the changes. I'll take a closer look when I have more time. It 
has been a while since I looked at the search and profile code. It is
not that easy to see what changes you made as you provided a modified copy
of the original source trees. A unified diff of the changes would have made
the review process easier.

Search by keywords in the profile module sounds good. I don't quite see the
need for the change to the database structure for regions. When an OS
instance shuts down the entry in the hostsregister table should be removed. 
IIRC, when the search parser wants to retrieve data for a given entry in the 
hostsregister table, it deletes all data for that host before adding the 
current data.

Rather than adding a date you could use the failcounter field in the
hostsregister table. If an OS instance listed in that table &quot;goes away&quot; the
failcounter will keep incrementing and the data for that host would remain 
in the tables until the OS instance becomes available.

IIRC, the parsing routine will stop checking a region after the failcounter 
reaches a given value. If it doesn't, it could be easily updated to do so 
and when that limit is reached, the host entry and associated data could be 
removed automatically. This might be the better approach and no special 
clean up would be required as it would happen automatically.

Removing the classifieds table from one of the modules isn't the right thing
to do. One would expect typical OS install to have both search and profile 
modules but each module can work without the other.

An external web page (for example) could create classifieds to be seached 
without the need for the profile module. On the other hand, someone could 
create classifieds using the profile section in their viewer that would be 
searched via a web page if the search module wasn't installed.

You might be seeing a problem with the modules if you are using a separate 
databases. While it would be possible to do so, it would need some changes 
to the code to avoid difficulties when it comes to creation/searching of 
classifieds. In the &quot;First time installation&quot; section of the README in the 
ossearch module source tree I mention that you should use the same database 
for osprofile and ossearch.
