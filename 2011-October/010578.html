<PRE>If you want to create your own organization of ini files, OpenSimulator provides several mechanisms:

OpenSimDefaults.ini is always read on startup
OpenSim.ini is read after
Ini files that exist in the bin/config/ directory are read
There is an include mechanism (checkout out then architecture section of the stock OpenSim.ini for examples)
XML formatted configuration files can be read from an URL (using the include mechanism)

The possibilities are endless.

The downside to building your own ini files is that, as OpenSimulator adds and modifies new parameters, your configuration files become stale and it gets harder and harder to verify that your configuration is reasonable for the current OpenSimulator sources.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Question/Suggestion regarding *.ini files

I do not speak about a paradigm change (OpenSim as is, is super and the progress you developer are showing, is tremendous) - i only speak about the possibility, to extract specific configuration sections into separate files. Maybe it is possible (you mentioned, that it can be done by the admin?!). Thats's all, what needed. Maybe only a hint to the explanation of this possibility and a how to is enough? As I said - maybe I missed something?

But, of course, I only speak for me and myself and that's only my outcome of my experience.

Markus

The way the system is working now means the user can merge a working
configuration and then edit only a subset. There is no need for a
paradigm change because the goal is already achievable. It doesn't
do this out of the box but can easily be made to do it by the admin
of the system. Grids are too different from each other to
accommodate their hypothetical needs in the base distro.

Dear All,

I've a question regarding the OpenSim.ini, *Common.ini, etc. These ini files are heavily influenced by the implementations and developments you make. Some parameters never change (i.e. Database settings, Group settings etc.) but others do.

Is it possible, to inject the code, which is more static by including files? Example: the port, which is used for a region/simulation is configured in the [Network] section and never changes because, once it is running on this port, you will never change it - especially if you host regions on one server. I think, it might be a good idea to call a separate (static) file like 'include network_section &quot;path/network.ini&quot;' to inject the code like you do to distinguish between HyperGrid, Standalone, etc.

The user (Grid Admin or, if on another server and allowed by the Grid Admin, the region admin) then has only to enable/disable the features in the (new) OpenSim.ini without taking care about the settings, which depends on that specific region like database, port , groups, etc ...

In fact, this will reduce upgrade times needed for upgrading a full grid from day's to hours. Especially most tasks can be automated. Maybe this option is available today (i don't know) but if not, it might be a good idea to implement it? If I missed something, perhaps only a hint of this possibility is missing on opensimulator.org?

Also, I think, the possibilities of the switches within ROBUST.ini are not that good described. I do not know, if robust.ini is the file, which plays the only role for the asset/inventory/user..... server environment. Does OpenSim.ini plays a role for robust server only as well? I think, others are puzzling exactly the same.

What do you think? Sorry - if there's a better place, to place my questions, please tell me.

With kind Regards
Markus
