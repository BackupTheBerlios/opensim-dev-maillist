<PRE>Hello,
i am sorry i wasn't aware of that policy. I tough it was like Jira where you 
can DONATE any idea to Lindenlab.

I am Java and PHP programmer so i can't implement my ideas. Ho ever i believe 
that i am able to propose good changes giving big results with minimal work 
and respect to the architecture (as far as my knowledge of it goes).

I believe that ideas like the one with live and backup assets and inventory 
tables have  big value. And my proposal was NOT aimed to help to me self but 
rather grids like is OSG.

This was my attempt to help. Only i want for it is little credit for the idea.

If you think that my ideas are not worthy or are problematic just stop me 
clearly, please, and i will accept that. 

On the other side i believe that outsiders like i can bring great feedback and 
new angles of view to the problems...

Thank you, Bo

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think that we don't really need to purge assets. Only what we need is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have unused assets, inventory folders and inventory items in separate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; backup tables so most of the operations is done within small tables and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even grids with rich history can have very fast assets servers.
