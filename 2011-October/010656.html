<PRE>Hello, 
thanks for the reply. 

I think i was not enough specific. I didn't meant that it is supposed to send 
IMs to avatars. I meant that a person will get a PIN on the website and pass 
it to a inworld script which will pass it back to the registration system and 
approve the user.

HG is slowly becoming standard. So i hope that anyone could HG to the  Lbsa...

Bo

&gt;<i> @Bo, i kind of like the idea, and i definitely think that it would
</I>&gt;<i> work for a grid-specific wiki, like the OSGrid wiki, or the Inworldz
</I>&gt;<i> wiki. However, the OpenSim wiki would have to be able to send a
</I>&gt;<i> message to every grid, including those that are not listed anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> You could make a custom signup form, asking for avatar name, grid (in
</I>&gt;<i> a freeform textbox), etc. But that may in turn lead to an even worse
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerability.
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine the following scenario: This guy called Bo bumped into my
</I>&gt;<i> avatar and did not apologize, and i want to take revenge. So i write
</I>&gt;<i> some script that will fill out his avatar name and grid into our shiny
</I>&gt;<i> new form. You would then get bombarded by a massive number of requests
</I>&gt;<i> to confirm your identity, ruining your fun of being in-world. And we
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to be responsible for that either. It would turn us from
</I>&gt;<i> target for spam, into a griefing tool. And i would much rather be a
</I>&gt;<i> target than a tool :-)
</I>
