<PRE>Dear All,

I've a question regarding the OpenSim.ini, *Common.ini, etc. These ini 
files are heavily influenced by the implementations and developments you 
make. Some parameters never change (i.e. Database settings, Group 
settings etc.) but others do.

Is it possible, to inject the code, which is more static by including 
files? Example: the port, which is used for a region/simulation is 
configured in the [Network] section and never changes because, once it 
is running on this port, you will never change it - especially if you 
host regions on one server. I think, it might be a good idea to call a 
separate (static) file like 'include network_section &quot;path/network.ini&quot;' 
to inject the code like you do to distinguish between HyperGrid, 
Standalone, etc.

The user (Grid Admin or, if on another server and allowed by the Grid 
Admin, the region admin) then has only to enable/disable the features in 
the (new) OpenSim.ini without taking care about the settings, which 
depends on that specific region like database, port , groups, etc ...

In fact, this will reduce upgrade times needed for upgrading a full grid 
from day's to hours. Especially most tasks can be automated. Maybe this 
option is available today (i don't know) but if not, it might be a good 
idea to implement it? If I missed something, perhaps only a hint of this 
possibility is missing on opensimulator.org?

Also, I think, the possibilities of the switches within ROBUST.ini are 
not that good described. I do not know, if robust.ini is the file, which 
plays the only role for the asset/inventory/user..... server 
environment. Does OpenSim.ini plays a role for robust server only as 
well? I think, others are puzzling exactly the same.

What do you think? Sorry - if there's a better place, to place my 
questions, please tell me.

With kind Regards
Markus
