Hello,

Just pushed a new branch with support for creating https listeners in
OpenSimulator. The support is available in both the region server and
in Robust. I have tested the region server with the remote admin plugin
sample code from:
<A HREF="http://xyzzyxyzzy.net/2008/01/23/using-pythons-xmlrpclib-with-opensim/">http://xyzzyxyzzy.net/2008/01/23/using-pythons-xmlrpclib-with-opensim/</A> .
And tested Robust with a modified version of my WxService (made to properly
load directly into Robust) and some python clients. This is not intended
for
Region&lt;--&gt;Region or Region&lt;--&gt;Robust communications at this time. But,
instead, it is for aimed at providing secure links for external
applications
needing to communicate with either the region server or Robust services.
Hopefully this will be helpful to users that need to build applications
against
OpenSimulator that talk over the open Internet.

There are a couple of ways this can be used. In Robust, you are able to
make
the main server run as https, in case you are running a couple of
applications
on a separate server that doesn't need to communicate with the
traditional region
service. You can also run it as an auxiliary service on a separate port
from the main,
non-https, server. Just pass the port you assigned to the https listener
with the
parameters in your ServiceConnectors string to have your application use it.

In the OpenSim region server, you can only use the https service as an
auxiliary to
the main listener. Assign the port in your module configuration to have
it use the
https listener, instead of the main one. See the remote admin plugin to
see how
you may do this in your own code.


Thanks,
BlueWall
