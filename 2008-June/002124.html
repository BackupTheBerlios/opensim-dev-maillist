<PRE>Hello Charles.

as I described in an earlier post, the issue is that you need to know your way around before you can start writing even the tiniest function. 

To get more people into 'active mode', the project would need to organized enablement sessions that cover the basics:

- how to set up the programming environment
- how to load the latest code version
- overall layout of the OpenSim codebase
- how to find the functions that you need
- how to write code that complies with the project standards
- how to test and upload your results

The core team should offer VOIP sessions for each step and through mentoring get people to a level where they become productive. 

(I understand that there are hardcore programmers around who might think that this is child' s play. Let me tell you this: I have a Master in 
Computer Science and I have had a look at the code - general programming skills alone are not sufficient in this case).

Regards,

Ezekiel

  We need to figure out how to gain momentum again in getting patches from additional folks to flesh out the remaining 95 or so NotImplemented LSL functions in C#. So, the e-mail is a request to folks to consider adding patches to finish the list of 328+ functions.

  We have 2/3 of them implemented and virtually all are fairly short subroutines.

  We have made great progress in getting to this point with the help of the several dozen different folks that have submitted patches to take the stub routines and add substance to them. Now the mission is to complete the balance per our original vision.

  Charles
