 &gt; Well, from what I recall of the discussion, this is because if we
 &gt; store or use asset IDs, and someone changes the item itself, we
 &gt; would miss that. Of we were to store 13 wearable assets and the
 &gt; complete set of visual params, and then someone would go and edit
 &gt; something they're wearing, we'd not apply the edit to the
 &gt; appearance. So, the inventory is checked at login time to pick up
 &gt; changes. That was the general idea.

 &gt; Of course, if we changed things so that wearables were updated right
 &gt; after leaving the appearance editor, then we could trust that data
 &gt; on startup. Also, getting the visual params earlier would stop
 &gt; everyone appearing as anti ruth during login.

I agree with this. We should be able to trust the asset IDs in the 
avatarapperance table. Using the inventory server to synchronize it 
afterwards in each login process is just a bad fix. Much better to fix 
the code so that they are updated together with the inventory.

I've removed the Inventory server dependency from AvatarApperance in 
r5074. It can easily be undone if it creates lots of problems, but it 
would be better to get a proper fix. Test and let us know what isn't 
working.
