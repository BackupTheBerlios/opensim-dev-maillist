I don't understand how your approach deals with sniffing the wire or the
cache, finding the asset UUID, and just embedding that in you items or
scripts.

You need to either care about ownership of assets a lot, in which case
you want every asset reference to generate a new asset so you can track
them, or you don't, and you assume you can track enough on the inventory
front.  The middle ground seems to be really silly.  Doesn't solve the
take down problem, and just continues to force a lot of cruft into the
system.

Anyway, it's a little moot for right now, as the current system is
there.  But I really think the way forward involves us using a hashing
strategy.  Once we dig in there, we'll see how hard it would be to make
UUID generation runtime configurable.  And keep this in mind.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
