<PRE>Hi,

please note, I didn't say &quot;Be 100% SL compatible&quot;

I said &quot;Create a 100% SL compatible user experience for _users of the SL 
client_&quot;

It leaves all avenues to do things differently internally, and expose 
things in different and more sophisticated ways to users of other clients.

That is an important distinction. It just means we should not make it 
impossible to _mask_ things to the SL client, so that the SL client user 
experiences OpenSim like he experiences SL.

What I meant was that in that case,
 the _content_creator_ would have to have the items in his inventory (and probably set to something like 'anyone can copy'... ;) )The moment he takes them out of his inventory, they are gone. Which, incidentally, probably is the kind of control you'd want anyway. If you want some kind of 'system' assets, they could be given to a system user. Continuing on the 'detailed keeping track' the _scripted_change_ would also update the references, so that the object itself would then keep a reference to the texture. By the way, the same track-keeping thing would go for objects; that would mean that the moment a user is gone, truly unused objects can be reaped from assets and inventory. This is not proposing a solution, merely trying to think outside the SL box.Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Date: Tue, 24 Jun 2008 10:09:34 +0100&gt; From: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">melanie at t-data.com</A>&gt; To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev

Content &gt; creators are at the moment extremely happy to not have to do this! &gt; The ability to reference textures and sounds by UUID is a &gt; fundamental one, removing it would break every texture-changing &gt; object and every fountain and door (since they don't contain the &gt; actual sounds, either)&gt; &gt; Melanie&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; Opensim-dev&gt; @lists.berlios.de&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; --------------------------------------------
