<PRE>I'm totally inside the SL box in respect to the user/creator experience. 
I am expecting large amounts of products to come to OpenSim, and those 
creators don;t want to relearn things.

Great if we find a way to solve problems differently and better than LL 
did, behind the scenes, but I'm s strong proponent for keeping the user 
experience for users of the SL viewer 100% compatible.

Meaning, no script changes, no new fields. Nothing to confuse creators 
who already ask &quot;Why should I go through all this effort just to bring 
my products to your grid?&quot;

These agreements/alliances are fragile already.

Again, the potential loss is not comparable to the cost of a few more 
gigs of storage.

</I>&gt;<i> Actually, no. What I meant was that in that case, the _content_creator_ would have to have the items in his inventory (and probably set to something like 'anyone can copy'... ;) )The moment he takes them out of his inventory, they are gone. Which, incidentally, probably is the kind of control you'd want anyway. If you want some kind of 'system' assets, they could be given to a system user. Continuing on the 'detailed keeping track' the _scripted_change_ would also update the references, so that the object itself would then keep a reference to the texture. By the way, the same track-keeping thing would go for objects; that would mean that the moment a user is gone, truly unused objects can be reaped from assets and inventory. This is not proposing a solution, merely trying to think outside the SL box.Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A>
