<PRE>Actually, no. What I meant was that in that case, the _content_creator_ would have to have the items in his inventory (and probably set to something like 'anyone can copy'... ;) )The moment he takes them out of his inventory, they are gone.
 
Which, incidentally, probably is the kind of control you'd want anyway.
 
If you want some kind of 'system' assets, they could be given to a system user.
 
Continuing on the 'detailed keeping track' the _scripted_change_ would also update the references, so that the object itself would then keep a reference to the texture.
 
By the way, the same track-keeping thing would go for objects; that would mean that the moment a user is gone, truly unused objects can be reaped from assets and inventory.
 
This is not proposing a solution, merely trying to think outside the SL box.

Content &gt; creators are at the moment extremely happy to not have to do this! &gt; The ability to reference textures and sounds by UUID is a &gt; fundamental one, removing it would break every texture-changing &gt; object and every fountain and door (since they don't contain the &gt; actual sounds, either)&gt; &gt; Melanie&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
