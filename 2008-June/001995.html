<PRE>The mind boggles at the cycles burned on this.

This Christmas, a texture-changing tree was popular in SL. It would 
change textures 3 times per second on 6 faces.

I suppose and object like that would likely crash a ref'ing system, or 
slow things to a crawl.
They were already lagtastic in SL!

There would need to be some pretty inelligent ref caching.

Also, no, I don't want assets linked to the creator's inventory.

If they choose to leave my grid, that should not invalidate their items. 
  Also, a creator should not retain control over a sold item.

</I>&gt;<i> By the way, the same track-keeping thing would go for objects; that would mean that the moment a user is gone, truly unused objects can be reaped from assets and inventory.
