<PRE>Parriotic Nigras or PN gave me an awfull lot of trouble on SL, I was an
Estate Manager for 4 sims, and when they attacked, they attacked hard, and
from what I can remember used object spamming and made the sim crash via
physics attacks, is there a way open sim can have a failsafe built into the
simulators that after x ammout of objects say 1000 have been created in a
very short period of time say 2 seconds, by the same user, the sim wont
accept objects for a shot time, maby 30 - 1 min, to give estate owners or
people with powers time to respond with out having the sim go down on them

Since a few days the Griefers called Patriotic Nigras started to attack
Opensim Grids

Osgrid is now attacked a few Days with bad attacks and we have no function
to ban a user or either kick a user gridwide, so i thought about a method to
ban a user from any console where the consoles server is allowed to have
gridwide admin status

 

look on my demonstration pic, that would work fine to kick a user or ban a
user gridwide:

 

<A HREF="http://xionx.de/bannuser.jpg">http://xionx.de/bannuser.jpg</A>

an admin enters on a granted console the command, then the command runs
through the gridserver and in the main database it will be checked if that
consoles server is allowed to kick or ban users gridwide.
