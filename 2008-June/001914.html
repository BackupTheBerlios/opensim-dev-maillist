<PRE>Olish,
 
Sorry if I was being unclear - I'm not saying you can't let people host at home - we do it, and there are several other grids that do it too. I'm just saying that a percentage of people will have trouble with their home routers (around 30% or so of home non-power users it seems)
Also, you can still have the region up for others to view (Since it's visible from the outside) you just can't enter it yourself thru the grid server. Although this is impractical, it's not a show-stopper so to speak. Especially not if they can access the region directly in some way, ie, not by logging in or teleporting into it via the grid, but directly, like in sandbox mode.
 
We have solved this for the users that has this problem by letting people build locally, in a disconnected 'sandbox', then upload their region to our servers.
 
Of course, there could be protocol changes devised to let the grid server return the local ip if the request comes from the external ip (ie, keep track of all LANs)
 
Also, this is not an issue with standalone sims that have their own login server and do not teleport. There has been some work done trying to devise a non-grid network of standalone sims.
 
The Obvious JIRA would be to let the protocol send a full host name and port (or IP and port as a string) instead of a IP address in the form of a 32-bit int and a 16-bit int.
 
That would let you let your viewers on your LAN to resolve the host name to a local IP, while letting external users resolve to the external IP.
 
It's bloody amazing that they, in the year 2008, still seem to use IP addresses in the form of an int.

It would have been wonderful for &gt; people to host their regions at home.&gt; &gt; Can we eventually think about some viewer changes ?&gt; Do you think we could file a JIRA at this subject and would Lindens take &gt; it in account ? :s&gt; &gt; Kind regards,&gt; &gt; Olish Newman.&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
