</I>&gt;<i> inventory becomes untraceable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> User A uploads a texture. She creates a skin, which she sells.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> User B uses a ripper to clone the appearance of a person wearing

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They then proceeed to reupload the texture, create a skin from it, 
</I>&gt;<i> and sell that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Person A files a DMCA complaint, which results in a takedown order. 
</I>&gt;<i> If upload coalescing were in effect, those skins would use the same 
</I>&gt;<i> UUID. There would be no way to destroy the skins that were created 
</I>&gt;<i> from the copy and leave the ones created by the original creator 
</I>&gt;<i> unharmed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If one upload = one asset, all I need is to replace the image data 
</I>&gt;<i> with a &quot;missing image&quot;, or, as Neb suggested, &quot;Missing Ethics&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> bitmap. All items created from it are instantaneously unwearable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All builds a stolen building texture is used on would then show that 
</I>&gt;<i> replacement image, e.g. be unusable. The DMCA takedown would be 
</I>&gt;<i> compiled with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With coalescing, there is no way that can be done, I would have to 
</I>&gt;<i> remove the asset, which will destroy all builds/items created by the 
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate creator as well. She would have a lot of very angry 
</I>&gt;<i> customers.
</I>
No, if we used inventory generations like I said, it would be a single
database update:

update inventoryitems set assetid=STOPSTEALINGTEXTURES where generation=STOLENGENERATION;

We need to seperate out the use case people want to support from the way
one implements it in Linden land today.  I very much understand your use
case, and want to support it in the system, as it will be important to
some people.  However, I don't think the best way to do that is keeping
the random UUID model that exists today.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
