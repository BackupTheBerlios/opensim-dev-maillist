<PRE>Hello,

I have noticed some issues when running OpenSim on Windows XP which regional settings are set to a different culture than en-US.

Please take a look on <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1611">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1611</A> and <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1382.">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=1382.</A>

I noticed that Framework.Culture.SetCurrentCulture() is called to force the thread culture to en-US when the simulator is being started.

However, it seems that threads which are created during OpenSim execution are using a CultureInfo based on the operating system regional settings. I suppose this happens to the scripts threads. I have included a snapshot in mantis 1611 that shows the current thread culture and the result of a vector ToString() conversion in the Watch box during debug mode in VS2008.

The french culture I am using uses decimal symbol as coma &quot;,&quot; instead of point &quot;.&quot;. This makes convert, tryparse and tostring() methods to fail or send erroneous results. For example, Vector parsing operation and some deserialization operations. For example, llSetPrimitiveParams([PRIM_SIZE], &lt;10,10,10&gt;]); gives a flat prim that correspond to a &lt;10,0,10&gt; scale 

I have tried to hack the ThreadTracker to force the threads culture to en-US in Add() method, and everything is ok. I dont think this would be a recommended solution because ThreadTracker has not been design for this purpose. For now I switched the regional settings of Windows to en-US.

Because I think OpenSim aims to be culture independant, I think the best is to force the en-US culture at some &quot;root&quot; level for threads too. Another solution consists in passing the right cultureinfo to every culture-sentive methods. I have seen that 1382 is assigned to Adam. I dont know what is the best to do and I welcome recommendations.

Oh, by the way, I have no clue whether it happens with Linux and MacOSX operating system.

Cheers,
Laurent.
