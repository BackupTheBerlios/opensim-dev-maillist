Fortunately this list actually has been pruned down (at least I've been
trying :))
 * .yap have been pulled (db4o is no longer in the tree)
 * database configs are now deprecated, you can fully specify them all
   as connection strings in either opensim.ini or grid configs (there
   are even user messages telling people that if they are using the old
   model).
 * NHibernate doesn't need any of it's own user changable config outside
   of opensim.ini.  The nhibernate config is just annotations to make
   some log messages go away.

So that does get us down to:
 * estate settings
 * grid configs
 * Nini based stuff (opensim.ini, stock content libraries)
 * .configs on .exe files for log4net
 * region configs

But that's still *a lot*, especially as each of those are different.
One of the reasons no one has touched estate settings is that it's the
deepest darkest part of config.  Our first config mechanism.  There be
dragons there, and not the anthropomorphic friendly type. :)

&gt;<i> So, we're starting to get something like what we're trying to solve

+1.  100% agreed.

&gt;<i> At some point, we need to look at unifying our configs. Introducing
</I>&gt;<i> Nini was a stab at that, but seems to have lost momentum. Personally,
</I>&gt;<i> I have somewhat lost faith in Nini, as it doesn't really seem to

</I>
Is there a good example on that?  The Nini XML used for assets doesn't
seem too bad.  I do agree that on the ini side we've got some work
there.

Having looked, and thrown up my hands on modding estate settings, I'd
suggest Nini replacements for the rest of the non nini, custom loaders,
would help *a lot* in cleaning up the source base, and making it make
more sense.

We may also want to switch OpenSim.ini to an xml file if we want more
nesting.  Big OpenSim.ini files definitely seem overwhelming at this
point, though not too unweildly.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
