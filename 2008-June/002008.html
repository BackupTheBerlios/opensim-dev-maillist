<PRE>I use this a lot, and would gladly offer to host it elsewhere.

 

Bug me if you need a server.

 

Regards,

-anyone needs ?

 

Hey all,

My server lease on where the opensim.be is sitting will come to an end
soon - was wondering if the nightly build and/or git mirror is of any
use for anyone at all, or it is just a waste of bandwidth and CPU.

If there's some folks that do find it useful, then shout now - and I'll
try to find the time to relocate the whole thing to the small VM which I
have for next-to-free, where it would find its new home (assuming it
still fits into the machine :-)
If there's no interested parties, it would quietly go into the oblivion
within the next month or so.

The &quot;downsize&quot; has to do mainly with my lack of time to do anything
useful on opensim (and some other distracting factors :-) - as well as
to real-life requirements to spend some more time on the RL identity.

/d

p.s. big kudos to ldvoipeng for the excellent uptime - the reboot  251
days ago was actually some stuff that I was mucking around with:
