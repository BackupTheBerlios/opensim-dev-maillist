</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, to make a long story short: Regions don't own assets. Regions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use assets. Users own assets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do know that you are primarily interested in the SL paradigm.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> But from where I'm coming, there's definitively scenarios where 
</I>&gt;<i> regions can own assets.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> The question is whether those assets can then leave the region.
</I>hmm...if we wanted them to be able to leave (do you mean &quot;leave&quot; as in 
&quot;go away&quot; or &quot;leave&quot; as in &quot;take a copy&quot;?) the region's asset server 
could serve them to wherever they are going.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, a centralized asset storage is certainly needed, tied into the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concepts around asset portability, possibly several centralized
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; asset servers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think portable assets should be our base case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But assets are immutable and a region is a finite space. This makes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it an ideal situation for a persistent cache.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Totally so.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tier 1: referenced assets, indefinite retention
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tier 2: unreferenced assets, short term retention
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How would one decide what assets are 'referenced'?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, because of the ability to reference an asset by it's UUID,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; letting a region &quot;own&quot; an asset is still not possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, there is still a 'calling context' around that reference.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Building from what I call the 'base case' you can definitively solve a 
</I>&gt;<i> lot of these references, one feature at a time.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> (For example, if each avatar had a 'home asset server' that is 
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to serve the avatars assets, the case of resolving 
</I>&gt;<i> 'wearables' would mean going thru the wearables, requesting them from 
</I>&gt;<i> the home asset server, and caching them - possibly under a _local_ id. 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, the next step would be resolving assets referenced by those 
</I>&gt;<i> wearables, but that's the next step.)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> (A 'home asset server' could have a 'default gateway asset server' 
</I>&gt;<i> that it falls back upon if it can't find an asset. And again, 
</I>&gt;<i> permanently cache it if found 'upstreams'.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But, now there are three scenarios:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) The prim is pushed across a region boundary. The destination
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; region requests the texture from the asset server and fails. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prim will turn gray.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) Provided the scenario allows pushing local prims across boundaries.
</I>&gt;<i> b) The Prim can have a 'home asset server' which is the first region.
</I>exactly.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) The prim has previously been &quot;take&quot;n. A copy exists in egent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inventory, but the list of the resources needed to reconstitute this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;object&quot; is hidden in the asset, actually, multiple asset records.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the texture has been removed from the central server, rezzing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this object in any region where the texture is not in use will fail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) Provided the scenario allows local prims to be 'taken'
</I>&gt;<i> b) See 1, I guess?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) If i deleted the texture, there is no guarantee that I have also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lost it's UUID. I may have a notecard with all my texture UUIDs and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use them in scripts. Such scripts, taken to other regions, would fail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, what happens if we let go of the paradigms of the online social 
</I>&gt;<i> game Second Life and think more of how the web works?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> There is definitively a lot of 404's and broken image links out there. 
</I>&gt;<i> And somehow, it's still useable.
</I>agree. i'm afraid that we will have to live with the occasional grey prim...
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Issue 1 could be addressed by transferring the needed resources
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; along with the object, however, on a distributed grid like OSGrid,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this can be time-consuming, as home DSL may be involved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I misunderstand you, but in order to forward it to the agent, we 
</I>&gt;<i> need to transfer it to the region anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Issue 3 could be addressed by creating a list of resources needed at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the time of the &quot;take&quot; and making that part of the inventory record.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This would significantly bloat the inventory table, as each prim's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inventory, face textures and all sounds/animations it might play are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; listed in the database.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Issue 3 cannot be reasonably addressed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I beg to differ. I think this very doable. I just think we need to 
</I>&gt;<i> boil the use case down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Therefore, caching, which is something I have looked into and am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; going to write some code for, is an absolutely viable solution for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; many of the raised issues, but weeding the central server's contents
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in such a way seems to be impracticable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yay!
