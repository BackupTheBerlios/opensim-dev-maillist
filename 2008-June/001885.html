So consensus is:

- Its basically a good idea with no real objections?

- There should be a list of Criticial Modules given in OpenSim.ini, with
the rest being loaded if available?

What should this list look like? &quot;critical_modules=foo.dll,bar.dll,...&quot;?
Or is there a better way to go?

- What is the best way to gracefully fail? Has anyone thought of failure
modes or failure strategies?

I'm looking for your advice knowing well the architecture of OpenSim --
especially those who are running grids. Is there anything that needs to
be handled in such a system to avoid doing any damage whatsoever to the
grid.

For example if a grid server goes down due to missing plugin, should it
notify UAIR servers?

- What is the most appropriate form of notification in practice?

Email comes to mind, but perhaps we can do better than that...

Cheers,
