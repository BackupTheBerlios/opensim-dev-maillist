<PRE>A policy of not reaping assets must, eventually, fail; such a lack of 
closure must ultimately be fatal (albeit maybe over a long time). Seems 
like a nice solution would be to move &quot;unreferenced&quot; assets to a secondary 
asset database. If they are referenced during some defined interval then 
they would be automatically restored to the primary database, if not, then 
after an appropriate interval, they could be eliminated altogether. If you 
have assets you care about, then you would make sure that something 
referenced them periodically to keep them in the mix, or even have a 
formal asset registration process that allows you to designate an asset as 
required.

Best regards

 From this, it sounds like it isn't valid within the Second Life system 
to take asset uuids as input to a script (or obfuscate them within the 
script) and expect those assets to always exist.  Is this correct?

I always vaguely thought that asset reaping wasn't possible because of 
the possibility of external input of uuids.  But if Linden Labs doesn't 
make this guarantee, then it must also be possible for OpenSim to do 
some asset reaping.  This would depend on the nature of the grid in 
question (e.g. it would be easier to reap assets on a grid which only 
allows its own region servers to connect).
