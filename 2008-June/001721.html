<PRE>Hi Justin,

Thanks again.
I do hope all the developers here understand that I am not in any way 
complaining, quite the opposite as I am very grateful to all for their 
contributions and the work you folks are doing here.  I do wish I could 
contribute more, but I'm afraid I am a c# &quot;Beginner&quot; at best... so 
testing is all I'm good for! :)

Yes it did run, after I made the new folder and downloaded a fresh copy 
but I was more concerned over why these errors/warnings suddenly decided 
to show up.
I've been downloading/compiling/testing without errors or warnings for 
about 3 months and suddenly these appeared.
I was concerned that something was wrong somewhere along the line.
I am still a bit perplexed as to why my original trunk/svn that I've 
been &quot;Caring/Feeding&quot; for sometime has become &quot;Unbuildable&quot; and my fresh 
downloaded trunk is showing errors when I never had any errors in the past.

Thanks again to all of you! :)
-Terry
