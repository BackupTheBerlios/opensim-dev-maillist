Hi all,

I'm not sure how I've done this... but I think I may have stumbled onto 
something, although I'm not sure if it is a good thing or a bad thing 
but I am excited!

I have &quot;ACCIDENTALLY&quot; teleported from one grid to another.
Has anyone made any recent changes to move the code towards this 
possibility?

I have a grid setup on my local network which is configured with only 
&quot;LOCAL&quot; ip addresses &quot;AND&quot; I have a completely separate grid which is 
accessible via the internet.

I use the &quot;Local&quot; grid for testing while the internet based grid is for 
the public.
These setups are completely isolated from each other.

The only things the &quot;Local&quot; grid shares with the Internet based grid is:
 - &quot;SOME&quot; of the region files but these have been changed to reflect 
only local ip addresses
 - Database info (a dump from the internet based grid was uploaded to a 
local machine)

After starting up each &quot;LOCAL&quot; console and manually configuring each for 
use on the local grid (local MySQL and local ip addresses only) I logged 
in but noticed that the map was showing some of the regions which I had 
intentionally omitted from my local setup. 
I thought this must be because the region info, etc from my &quot;Internet 
DUMP&quot; which I uploaded to my local database was still showing.
Just to see what would happen... I double clicked on one of the omitted, 
but still visible regions and to my surprise... I arrived in that region 
with a message saying that this simulator was running a diff. version.

Confused... wondering how I was in a region that did not exist locally I 
started to investigate.
I was on my Internet based grid!!

How in the world did that happen??  It was a smooth teleport ... maybe a 
second or 2 longer than I expected but I was on my internet based grid 
now instead of my local grid.
To prove to myself this is what happened, I logged into my internet 
based grid with another av and sure enough there I was!!
I logged out of the &quot;NET&quot; based grid and logged into my local grid with 
the other av.... where my first av was no where to be found.
I checked the map.... seen the &quot;GHOST&quot; regions... double-clicked on one 
of them and &quot;POOF&quot; I was on the &quot;NET&quot; based grid with my other av!
Both grids have their own UGAIM servers, but I apparently &quot;SNUCK&quot; right 
through them!

Not sure if this is significant, but it was rather amusing, confusing, 
and exciting all at the same time!
I will try to find out if this will work &quot;NET&quot; grid to &quot;NET&quot; grid next!

-Terry
