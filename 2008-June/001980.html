<PRE>Again, I don't see why we need to have assetId === sha-1 hash - if the only thing we want to accomplish with it is de-duping, we just make sure to send the hash along, and any context can choose to use it to de-dupe or not.
 
And to trust it or not.
 
Obviously, you wouldn't trust an assetId generated by an untrusted source to represent the asset binary anyway, so quite a lot of re-hashing and checking will be done along the way anyway.

I'm not convinced the SHA1 UUID will be extensible enough to allow for future plans.   The idea is to not assume anything with a UUID.  Adding assumptions increases scalability at the cost of extensibility.

Hi,Sean Dague wrote:&gt; I don't understand how your approach deals with sniffing the wire or the&gt; cache, finding the asset UUID, and just embedding that in you items or&gt; scripts.It doesn't. Because that approach is not enjoying blanket coveragein the DMCA. Means, in the case of UUID sniffing, each _item_ is aseparate violation, subject to a separate takedown order. Yes, oneper prim!If the texture is re-uploaded, blanket protection applies.The law isn't always common sense - in fact, it mostly diverges fromcommon sense!&gt; Anyway, it's a little moot for right now, as the current system is&gt; there.  But I really think the way forward involves us using a hashing&gt; strategy.  Once we dig in there, we'll see how hard it would be to make&gt; UUID generation runtime configurable.  And keep this in mind.I'm happy if that concern is not forgotten. That is all I wanted,recognition of this as a valid concern, so no decisions are madethat could ultimately lead to an entire grid being judicially shut down.Melanie_______________________________________________Opensim-dev mailing <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">listOpensim-dev at lists.berlios.dehttps</A>://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev
