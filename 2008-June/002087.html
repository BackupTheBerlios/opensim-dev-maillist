Yes. But not based on the region. You can subdivide assets between 
several different asset servers, and between several different asset 
services.

You might have your avatar registered on OpenID, and in a breave 
future world, subscribe to a number of asset services, which, 
combined, make up your inventory. Regions would have no need to 
access the asset server while you're not logged on, because they 
keep local copies of everything.

I don't think it's practicable, nor should it be a goal, to _limit_ 
assets to one region. Subdivision, yes. Multiple services, yes. 
Regions caching every asset they need to be able to render 
themselves in the absence of the original asset service, yes. But a 
region being the sole owner of an asset, no. That raises more issues 
than it solves. It's just a bit of disk space, in the end, and disk 
space is cheap.

Melanie
