<PRE>Hi,

</I>
It doesn't. Because that approach is not enjoying blanket coverage 
in the DMCA. Means, in the case of UUID sniffing, each _item_ is a 
separate violation, subject to a separate takedown order. Yes, one 
per prim!

If the texture is re-uploaded, blanket protection applies.

The law isn't always common sense - in fact, it mostly diverges from 
common sense!

&gt;<i> Anyway, it's a little moot for right now, as the current system is

</I>&gt;<i> strategy.  Once we dig in there, we'll see how hard it would be to make
</I>&gt;<i> UUID generation runtime configurable.  And keep this in mind.
</I>
I'm happy if that concern is not forgotten. That is all I wanted, 
recognition of this as a valid concern, so no decisions are made 
that could ultimately lead to an entire grid being judicially shut down.
