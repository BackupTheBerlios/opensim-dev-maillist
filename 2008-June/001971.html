That would only handle agent inventory. It would not handle textures 
applied to prims, or used in clothing, or audio files referenced by 
UUID from a script. Basically any asset that gets detached from 
inventory becomes untraceable.

The problem is this:

User A uploads a texture. She creates a skin, which she sells.

User B uses a ripper to clone the appearance of a person wearing 
that skin. They extract the texture, and download it.

They then proceeed to reupload the texture, create a skin from it, 
and sell that.

Person A files a DMCA complaint, which results in a takedown order. 
If upload coalescing were in effect, those skins would use the same 
UUID. There would be no way to destroy the skins that were created 
from the copy and leave the ones created by the original creator 
unharmed.

If one upload = one asset, all I need is to replace the image data 
with a &quot;missing image&quot;, or, as Neb suggested, &quot;Missing Ethics&quot; 
bitmap. All items created from it are instantaneously unwearable.

All builds a stolen building texture is used on would then show that 
replacement image, e.g. be unusable. The DMCA takedown would be 
compiled with.

With coalescing, there is no way that can be done, I would have to 
remove the asset, which will destroy all builds/items created by the 
legitimate creator as well. She would have a lot of very angry 
customers.

For those who want coalescing to save space, by all means, put it 
in, but please leave the option for one upload = one asset. The 
legal implications or business could be tremendous if that option is 
taken away, negatively impacting all commercial grids.

Melanie
