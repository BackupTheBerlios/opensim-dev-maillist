<PRE>Hi everyone,

my proposal is to subdivide current assets table into 2 tables:
user_assets  : for user owned assets (mainly in inventory, appearance,
attachment, ...)
  user_asset is used by UGAI servers
region_assets: for region owned assets, sounds, textures(including sun,
moon, ...)
  region_asset is used by region servers

I wrote the whole, detailed idea at:
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/User:Lulurun#proposal_to_subdivide_the_assets_table">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/User:Lulurun#proposal_to_subdivide_the_assets_table</A>
Please have a look at it, here is only a brief introduction.

This could bring us many advantages such as:
0. increase the dispersity of asset data, clarify the responsibility of each
server.
Currently, all of the asset data is stored in assets table, managed by
assetserver.
This would cause some problems:
 1. assets table keeps growing in a fast pace.
 2. hard to determine which asset is belongs to inactive regions (when you
want to &quot;clean&quot;
the assets table).
 3. assetserver not only serves users' data but also regions' data, if
something happened to
assetserver both of avatar and prims will become gray.
To separate assets table can not only solve these problems, but also brings
minor benefits
such like: reduce the responsibility of assetserver, disperse the asset
requests(especially
for big grid service), lower the risk of losing data, ...

1. for Data Portability in virtual world
For grid admin,
 * you can concentrate on managing only user(not region owner) relavent
information
   like &quot;users, avatarappearance, inventory&quot;
 * it can reduce the vulnerability caused by foreign assets.
 * when a region leaves your grid, you don't have to worry about its assets
becoming garbage.
  - on the other hand, this also good for region owners.
For when a user registers their region server with a grid,
 * When you want to switch your sim to a new grid, &quot;prims, primshapes,
terrain, region_asset&quot;
   are always tied-up together. the only thing you need to do is to edit
UGAI servers URI in
   your OpenSim.ini

For more advantages, please have a look at
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/User:Lulurun#Advantages">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/User:Lulurun#Advantages</A>

If this is a good way to go, not so many changes is needed:
* UGAI servers would remain as they used to be.
* VW user won't feel anything different.
* Of course this should be a option in OpenSim.ini so that we can
enable/disable/config
* Just need to add supports for a new table &quot;RegionAssets&quot; with the same
structure as &quot;assets&quot;.
* AssetClient in RegionServer should be improved to be able to get assets
from mutilple servers.

For more detailed plan of the implementation, please have a look at
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/User:Lulurun#Implementation">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/User:Lulurun#Implementation</A>

Any advice, comment, thought is appreciate.
