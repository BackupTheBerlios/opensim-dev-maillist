&gt;<i> Date: Mon, 2 Jun 2008 01:43:47 +0100&gt; From: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">jjustincc at googlemail.com</A>&gt; To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; Subject: [Opensim-dev] Should the core OpenSim distribution carry many scripting languages?&gt; &gt; Hi there,&gt; &gt; Last week, Kinoc was kind enough to write an implementation of Yield &gt; Prolog where YP is translated into underlying C# for compilation (in the &gt; same manner as our current LSL support). This patch was included in &gt; OpenSim in r4927.&gt; &gt; I have nothing against Prolog (admittedly I have never had the chance to &gt; pick up) and certainly nothing against Kinoc. However, I am concerned &gt; that by including many scripting languages in the OpenSim core &gt; distribution (if Prolog, why not Javascript, Ruby, Python, etc, etc.) we &gt; incur more negatives than positives. Firstly, I'm concerned that a &gt; proportion of this code (particularly that which no core committer has &gt; an interest in) will at some point slip into decay, particularly if the &gt; original contributor has moved on to other things. We've already seen &gt; this happen with other areas of the code, such as the MSSQL database &gt; support.&gt; &gt; Secondly, if individual language modules do need to change in response &gt; to other OpenSim changes without a decay option (for example, in order &gt; that they can still compile), this places a higher burden on the core &gt; committers and makes it more costly to enhance the codebase in general.&gt; &gt; Thirdly, I'm concerned that the more code we have of this nature &gt; (particular code which compiles script into c#), the more potential &gt; security holes we have. This isn't too much of a concern right now but &gt; will be come more of an issue in the future.&gt; &gt; Therefore, I would argue that OpenSimulator should only include in its &gt; core distribution support for a few scripting languages. In my opinion &gt; these would be LSL, maybe C# and possibly one other (maybe Python). &gt; Support for other languages would come as optional plugins, available &gt; either directly from the author or from some satellite repository &gt; (perhaps similar to Perl's CPAN or PHP's PEAR). I would personally &gt; prefer to see the core OpenSim distribution kept relatively lean and mean.&gt; &gt; If necessary, I am happy to make any necessary infrastructure changes to &gt; make language plugins possible/easier (which probably also means making &gt; much needed enhancements to the plugin system).&gt; &gt; What do other people think?&gt; &gt; Regards,&gt; &gt; -- &gt; justincc&gt; Justin Clark-Casey&gt; <A HREF="http://justincc.wordpress.com">http://justincc.wordpress.com</A>&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
