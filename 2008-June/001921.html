<PRE>That list is something we could do as a collaborative effort; we need that list for our grid, opensim and DeepGrid for their also,  (I guess?)  et c. Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A>

Olish,    I think the problem is that some older hardware will never be able to support it regardless of the changes we make, some older routers just dont handle UDP and port forwarding well, most residential routers and ISPs were not designed to host Enterprise level applications.  The easy answer to the solution is aquire a new router, most new routers are more than capable of hosting OpenSIM regions from ones home and broadband connections.Nebadon

Stefan,Thanks for the precisions.I hope in the future everybody will be able to host their region withoutsuch complications.Would be possible to do such a change in the OpenSim Grid server withouttoo much impact on the rest of the code ?Kind regards,Olish Newman.Stefan Andersson a &#233;crit :


&gt;<i> Olish,&gt;&gt; Sorry if I was being unclear - I'm not saying you can't let people&gt; host at home - we do it, and there are several other grids that do it&gt; too. I'm just saying that a percentage of people will have trouble&gt; with their home routers (around 30% or so of home non-power users it&gt; seems)&gt;&gt; Also, you can still have the region up for others to view (Since it's&gt; visible from the outside) you just can't enter it yourself thru the&gt; grid server. Although this is impractical, it's not a show-stopper so&gt; to speak. Especially not if they can access the region directly in&gt; some way, ie, not by logging in or teleporting into it via the grid,&gt; but directly, like in sandbox mode.&gt;&gt; We have solved this for the users that has this problem by letting&gt; people build locally, in a disconnected 'sandbox', then upload their&gt; region to our servers.&gt;&gt; Of course, there could be protocol changes devised to let the grid&gt; server return the local ip if the request comes from the external ip&gt; (ie, keep track of all LANs)&gt;&gt; Also, this is not an issue with standalone sims that have their own&gt; login server and do not teleport. There has been some work done trying&gt; to devise a non-grid network of standalone sims.&gt;&gt; The Obvious JIRA would be to let the protocol send a full host name&gt; and port (or IP and port as a string) instead of a IP address in the&gt; form of a 32-bit int and a 16-bit int.&gt;&gt; That would let you let your viewers on your LAN to resolve the host&gt; name to a local IP, while letting external users resolve to the&gt; external IP.&gt;&gt; It's bloody amazing that they, in the year 2008, still seem to use IP&gt; addresses in the form of an int.&gt;&gt; Best regards,&gt; Stefan Andersson&gt; Tribal Media AB&gt;&gt; Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Fri, 20 Jun 2008 12:02:41 +0200&gt; &gt; From: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">olish at newworldgrid.com</A>&gt; &gt; To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] A software to connect its own region and&gt; TP in from locally...&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hello Stefan,&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks a lot for your help on this topic.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm sad we cannot achieve this aim. It would have been wonderful for&gt; &gt; people to host their regions at home.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Can we eventually think about some viewer changes ?&gt; &gt; Do you think we could file a JIRA at this subject and would Lindens&gt; take&gt; &gt; it in account ? :s&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kind regards,&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Olish Newman.&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; &gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; &gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; &gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
