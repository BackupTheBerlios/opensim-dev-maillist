 From this, it sounds like it isn't valid within the Second Life system 
to take asset uuids as input to a script (or obfuscate them within the 
script) and expect those assets to always exist.  Is this correct?

I always vaguely thought that asset reaping wasn't possible because of 
the possibility of external input of uuids.  But if Linden Labs doesn't 
make this guarantee, then it must also be possible for OpenSim to do 
some asset reaping.  This would depend on the nature of the grid in 
question (e.g. it would be easier to reap assets on a grid which only 
allows its own region servers to connect).
