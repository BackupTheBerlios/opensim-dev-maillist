<PRE>I believe that we should use a plugin loader that allows us to 
configure plugin loading completely within our own .ini files. I 
think that a requirement to tweak complex XML based mono/.NET config 
files to get a plugin loaded will put running OpenSim out fo reach 
of many users.

That said, I'm all for a standardized way to load a plugin. I just 
think it shouldn't be required to edit conifg files outside of 
OpenSim's own.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now just meant to be a single application that functions as a SL clone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then its no longer anything like the project I started and thats a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very sorry state for it to end up in.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using in other applications is definitely ideal.  My comment mostly
</I>&gt;<i> comes from the fact that we shouldn't restrict changes in the core
</I>&gt;<i> source based based on components not in the core.  The plug points that
</I>&gt;<i> exist today aren't a binary interface that is crystalized forever.  This
</I>&gt;<i> project is still evolving.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Preventing forward progress on something as important as getting 1 way
</I>&gt;<i> to write a plugin (so you don't need to learn 4 different ways to write
</I>&gt;<i> 1 plugin for OpenSim) because someone has out of tree code based on the
</I>&gt;<i> old model seems against this spirit of constant evolution.
