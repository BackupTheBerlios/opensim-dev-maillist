<PRE>Terry,
 
Congratulations to your exciting find. :D
 
If your database contains information about regions on both grids (which the dump obviously did) then you will have all regions on the map - there is nothing filtering regions on grid id.
 
Now, if the database dump contains valid info about those external regions, a teleport will succeed, as your internal region will tell the grid services to tell the external region to expect you. I guess you have copied the user and authentication data as well?
 
(There is probably a big gaping security hole here...)
 
We at Tribal Media have actually contemplated using something like that to genreate a map including both local and external regions in an intra/extranet scenario.
 
The problem is the other way, teleporting back into a local region from an external region (the external region can't refer to local ip's)
 
but yeah, there are some interesting inter-grid scenarios with the SL protocol.
 
Something for all of you to ponder: The 'Map' is actually a function of the REGION, so every time you bring the map up, it's the region you're ON that decides what goes where on the map - NOT the grid.
 
This allows us to think of the map as a 'link map' with exit points out of a region, somewhat like hyperlinks or a web sitemap. (The notion of a region as a 'web page' is a darling of mine)Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A>

I double clicked on one of the omitted, &gt; but still visible regions and to my surprise... I arrived in that region &gt; with a message saying that this simulator was running a diff. version.&gt; &gt; Confused... wondering how I was in a region that did not exist locally I &gt; started to investigate.&gt; I was on my Internet based grid!!&gt; &gt; How in the world did that happen?? It was a smooth teleport ... maybe a &gt; second or 2 longer than I expected but I was on my internet based grid &gt; now instead of my local grid.&gt; To prove to myself this is what happened, I logged into my internet &gt; based grid with another av and sure enough there I was!!&gt; I logged out of the &quot;NET&quot; based grid and logged into my local grid with &gt; the other av.... where my first av was no where to be found.&gt; I checked the map.... seen the &quot;GHOST&quot; regions... double-clicked on one &gt; of them and &quot;POOF&quot; I was on the &quot;NET&quot; based grid with my other av!&gt; Both grids have their own UGAIM servers, but I apparently &quot;SNUCK&quot; right &gt; through them!&gt; &gt; Not sure if this is significant, but it was rather amusing, confusing, &gt; and exciting all at the same time!&gt; I will try to find out if this will work &quot;NET&quot; grid to &quot;NET&quot; grid next!&gt; &gt; -Terry&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
