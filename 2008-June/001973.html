<PRE>Last time this was up for discussion, I suggested we have a 'BinaryItem' with a 'BinaryId' that could well be a sha-1 and be used for de-duplication. This would be hashed on the binary data only, and would not have anything like 'name' or 'owner'.
 
then an 'AssetItem' would have a unique 'AssetId', context information like 'CreatedDate' and 'CreatedBy' and then a binaryId pointing to the common binary data.
 
If this feels difficult to handle, it would be a simple thing to create a combined 'view' in the database.
this is akin to the case of 'InventoryItem' with unique 'InventoryId' where several users can have the same asset, but under different name (and with different permissions)
 
Also note that the binaryId probably would be a local reference only, ie, never shared over any trust boundary.

I&gt; &gt; think that would be much better done by adding a field to inventory&gt; &gt; which is seeded on a new upload. Inventory transfers/copies keep that&gt; &gt; seed.&gt; &gt; That would only handle agent inventory. It would not handle textures &gt; applied to prims, or used in clothing, or audio files referenced by &gt; UUID from a script. Basically any asset that gets detached from &gt; inventory becomes untraceable.&gt; &gt; The problem is this:&gt; &gt; User A uploads a texture. She creates a skin, which she sells.&gt; &gt; User B uses a ripper to clone the appearance of a person wearing &gt; that skin. They extract the texture, and download it.&gt; &gt; They then proceeed to reupload the texture, create a skin from it, &gt; and sell that.&gt; &gt; Person A files a DMCA complaint, which results in a takedown order. &gt; If upload coalescing were in effect, those skins would use the same &gt; UUID. There would be no way to destroy the skins that were created &gt; from the copy and leave the ones created by the original creator &gt; unharmed.&gt; &gt; If one upload = one asset, all I need is to replace the image data &gt; with a &quot;missing image&quot;, or, as Neb suggested, &quot;Missing Ethics&quot; &gt; bitmap. All items created from it are instantaneously unwearable.&gt; &gt; All builds a stolen building texture is used on would then show that &gt; replacement image, e.g. be unusable. The DMCA takedown would be &gt; compiled with.&gt; &gt; With coalescing, there is no way that can be done, I would have to &gt; remove the asset, which will destroy all builds/items created by the &gt; legitimate creator as well. She would have a lot of very angry &gt; customers.&gt; &gt; For those who want coalescing to save space, by all means, put it &gt; in, but please leave the option for one upload = one asset. The &gt; legal implications or business could be tremendous if that option is &gt; taken away, negatively impacting all commercial grids.&gt; &gt; Melanie&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
