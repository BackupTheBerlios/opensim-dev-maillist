<PRE>Olish,
 
we are doing something similar to what you are describing with
 
<A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A>
 
- there you can download an windows application that gives you the ability to build locally, and either publish your local pc region or upload your build on our servers.
 
The issue you're seeing is known as the 'NAT bounce' or 'NAT loopback' issue - your router only translates and/or forwards traffic crossing the LAN-WAN border, which means that if you access your computer with the _external_ IP from _within_ the LAN, the traffic isn't 'bounced' back into the LAN, but is lost.
 
Normally, you would solve this by simply address the computer with your _internal_ IP from the inside (typically, you have host file settings or an internal dns that serves internal ip's within the LAN)
 
now, things are getting complicated with the Second Life viewer, as the viewer demands regions be addressed with _IP_, not host name, so the viewer never resolves anything, so host magic won't work.
 
so, on login and teleports, when the grid tells the viewer where to start, it would have to serve you your _internal_ IP - but your _external_ ip to the rest of the world.
 
Which gets complex.
The solution is either to configuring routing/translation manually (which is complex for an end-user) or to get a router that supports it out of the box.
