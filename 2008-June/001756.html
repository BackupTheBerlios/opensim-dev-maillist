Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Should the core OpenSim distribution
carrymanyscripting languages?

Thankyou for all the messages on this topic.  It sounds like we have a 
rough consensus that we should try and keep the functionality that ships

with OpenSim down to some set of 'core' modules.  I expect that the idea

of what functionality constitutes the core will probably have to be 
decided on a case by case basis, evolving over time.

In this particular case, it sounds like we should not regard Yield 
Prolog as a core module.  However, I don't think our modular interface 
(in the area of scripting) is quite advanced enough right now to support

a clean separation (though I haven't looked in any significant detail). 
  Therefore, in my opinion this code should remain in the tree and 
receive patches until the necessary underlying work is done to allow 
Yield Prolog to be easily plugged in.  I don't think Kinoc follows this 
list but I have made him aware of this discussion and what is likely to 
happen in the future.

As regards non-core module hosting, to me it sounds like the easiest 
first step is to ask module contributors to self host until we build up 
enough modules to justify a repository system.  Of course, that doesn't 
stop anyone establishing one in anticipation :)  I also like Stefan's 
idea of listing the existing core modules on the wiki, which at least 
would give people some idea of the plugin points that currently exist.

This is an interesting area for me so I hope to be able to do something 
towards making it easy (or easier) to separate out language modules 
soon, assuming no-one else works on this first.  I know Sean has also 
expressed his intention to look at mono-addins and the module system in 
general (which also needs to be improved, at the very least to provide 
some general mechanism for including and excluding modules rather than 
relying on the modules to do this for themselves).

Regards,
