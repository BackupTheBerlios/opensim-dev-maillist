Before we do this, we should make sure to actually do the version 5 uuid
implementation, which isn't just sha1, as it does some reserved bytes to
make sure that you can tell from the UUID what version generated it.

My suggestion, which came out on IRC, is that we create a singleton UUID
generator class that can be configed on construction as to which type to
generate.  Then we create version 4 (random, what we have today) and
version 5 (sha1 based on content) implementations (anyone that wants to
implement versions 1 - 3 is welcomed to).

UUID assignment would come in the form: UUID.Create(assetdata).

We'll always need UUID type 4 support for prims and other mutable
structures, as type 5 doesn't really make any sense.  But for assetid
assignment we can do this in a user configurable manner.  Also, because
the uuids are namespaced correctly, we can easily distinguish which were
created in which model.

Honestly, this is all probably a bit down the road.  But looking at the
UUID RFC is a good place to check out some of the peer reviewed models
for generating UUIDs.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
