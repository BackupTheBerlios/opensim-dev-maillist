<PRE>I should add to this, if we do any form of ban structure in OpenSim, it
should absolutely be IP and hostmask based.

 

Taking from IRC would be a good idea I think.

Adam

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Security on Opensim

 

I think the goal for user ban was mostly for Grid Admin purposes, im not
sure i like the idea of grid users being able to initiate a grid wide
ban.. our goal was more to give grid admins the ability to initiate a
grid ban, perhaps some kind of password should be required if a ban is
initiated at a console, but again only be able to be done by a grid
admin, not just anyone.   Also last 24 hours the SVN now has the ability
to ban on the parcel level and it is enforced.  So we do have a good
tool now for grid citizens and sim owners.   Also as another note we
have begun incorporating IP capture into OpenSIM Web Interface and the
ability to disable accounts on the grid as well as prevent that user
from visiting the website if you so choose, these are easily overcome by
people with knowledge, but its better than not having any ability.. So
if you would like to experiment with opensimwi you can grab a copy at
the website <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensimwiredux">http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensimwiredux</A> these mods
are still very young and will evolve over time, id like to hear
everyones thoughts on things that could be implemented into the Web
Interface to get a better grasp on security.  Thanks
