</I>&gt;<i> most of it, but that is not really what I had in mind. The Kan-Ed 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts were good for showing a large set worked in world, but I am 
</I>&gt;<i> thinking more systematic coverage and reporting. The Kan-Ed scripts 
</I>&gt;<i> still required interpretation by someone in world as to whether they 
</I>&gt;<i> were working properly or not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have had some irc discussions and I think the best approach for now is 
</I>&gt;<i> to have a set of scripts that are checked in and exist in inventory that 
</I>&gt;<i> can be run in world and would report the success or failure of the 
</I>&gt;<i> functions tested. Maybe this report could be pushed out to a webpage for 
</I>&gt;<i> on-line status of the current state of the LSL. This would be a 
</I>&gt;<i> supplemental  help to me as I  have been manually testing and updating 
</I>&gt;<i> the function list and status for several months now.  Additionally, it 
</I>&gt;<i> would be nice for putting a load on the script engine for scalability 
</I>&gt;<i> and performance testing. There are a few helper os functions that may 
</I>&gt;<i> need to be implemented, but the core of what would be tested would be 
</I>&gt;<i> done via LSL.

</I>&gt;<i> Comments?
