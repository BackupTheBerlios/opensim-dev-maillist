I think ryan's proposal remains very flexible.  All the flexibility in
OpenSim today in it's plugin system actually makes stuff very
confusing.  While that's ok to navigate for people that wrote the code,
it definitely hampers getting more people in.  The simple act of
starting to consolidate UUID string formats brought out a lot of people
that had found the old model too confusing and just gave up on the
project.  Some of them are now coming back into the fold. :)

&gt;<i> Btw, I think the little dig with the fork comment was out of line. We

</I>
Using in other applications is definitely ideal.  My comment mostly
comes from the fact that we shouldn't restrict changes in the core
source based based on components not in the core.  The plug points that
exist today aren't a binary interface that is crystalized forever.  This
project is still evolving.

Preventing forward progress on something as important as getting 1 way
to write a plugin (so you don't need to learn 4 different ways to write
1 plugin for OpenSim) because someone has out of tree code based on the
old model seems against this spirit of constant evolution.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
