<PRE>Hi,
&gt;<i> No, if we used inventory generations like I said, it would be a single
</I>&gt;<i> database update:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> update inventoryitems set assetid=STOPSTEALINGTEXTURES where generation=STOLENGENERATION;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Again, this will cover only agent inventory. not use of textures in 
clothing. Not use of textures on prims. Not asset UUIDs in scripts.

&gt;<i> We need to seperate out the use case people want to support from the way
</I>&gt;<i> one implements it in Linden land today.  I very much understand your use
</I>&gt;<i> case, and want to support it in the system, as it will be important to
</I>&gt;<i> some people.  However, I don't think the best way to do that is keeping
</I>&gt;<i> the random UUID model that exists today.
</I>
I believe one UUID per upload is a must. Coalescing the actual 
binary data to save space (20000 users uploading the same free 
texture from the internet) is a worthy goal. But the price of 
coalescing the Asset IDs is too high. Really high. Like, six-figures 
high. In legal fees, worst case.

Even though Linden didn't implement the optimum in most things, they 
have taken care to have at least the ability to comply with a court 
order.
I don't think it's wise to completely remove this ability from OpenSim.

I am very much willing to pay for expanding hard disk space if 
necessary - sure more willing to do that than to throw money to 
attorneys!

Melanie
