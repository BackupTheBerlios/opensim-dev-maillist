<PRE>Sean,
 
Regardless possibly differing end goals, I'm all +1 on this one. We have been talking about doing something about the LLUUIDs for so long, this is an excellent opportunity and tactic to do so.Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A>

Outside of OpenSim, there is no need to manipulate &gt; &gt; uuids in this scenario - collections of objects or scenes can be &gt; &gt; structured in any way that the external program pleases. Instead of &gt; &gt; getting asset uuids on import, the importing process calculates the &gt; &gt; necessary uuids from data, and can ask the asset service whether these &gt; &gt; already exist without needing to actually obtain the blobs.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think that it's possible to experiment with the hashing idea without &gt; &gt; requiring the whole system to change. Indeed, because of the very &gt; &gt; import scenario outlined above, I may well try using it for importing &gt; &gt; object archives. This shouldn't impact the rest of the system since, of &gt; &gt; course, the chances of collision are small.&gt; &gt; Before we do this, we should make sure to actually do the version 5 uuid&gt; implementation, which isn't just sha1, as it does some reserved bytes to&gt; make sure that you can tell from the UUID what version generated it.&gt; &gt; My suggestion, which came out on IRC, is that we create a singleton UUID&gt; generator class that can be configed on construction as to which type to&gt; generate. Then we create version 4 (random, what we have today) and&gt; version 5 (sha1 based on content) implementations (anyone that wants to&gt; implement versions 1 - 3 is welcomed to).&gt; &gt; UUID assignment would come in the form: UUID.Create(assetdata).&gt; &gt; We'll always need UUID type 4 support for prims and other mutable&gt; structures, as type 5 doesn't really make any sense. But for assetid&gt; assignment we can do this in a user configurable manner. Also, because&gt; the uuids are namespaced correctly, we can easily distinguish which were&gt; created in which model.&gt; &gt; Honestly, this is all probably a bit down the road. But looking at the&gt; UUID RFC is a good place to check out some of the peer reviewed models&gt; for generating UUIDs.&gt; &gt; -Sean&gt; &gt; -- &gt; __________________________________________________________________&gt; &gt; Sean Dague Mid-Hudson Valley&gt; sean at dague dot net Linux Users Group&gt; <A HREF="http://dague.net">http://dague.net</A> <A HREF="http://mhvlug.org">http://mhvlug.org</A>&gt; &gt; There is no silver bullet.
