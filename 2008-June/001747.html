<PRE>Hi James,

We are doing exactly that - trying to get OpenSim on mono stable for 
production. We use Linux and Solaris and experiment with various 
combination of components and builds. At the moment we run tests with 
mono 1.9.1 with different garbage collectors. E.g. on Solaris we run it 
with externally compiled latest Boehm GC - it proves to be pretty 
reliable and it might be worth trying for you if you experiencing mono 
crashes. We could coordinate our efforts and try to reproduce each other 
problems - it may ease debugging of core dumps and the like.

Another area of interest for us is continuous profiling of OpenSim on 
mono with custom-built profilers. On one hand unix-like environments 
offer so much more support and help in debugging and profiling binaries, 
but on the other, windows-based .Net platform has much better debugging 
and profiling support for .Net assemblies alone - we are trying to 
balance what to do on what, and how to make sensible comparisons between 
performance on Windows vs. Unix-based OpenSim deployments.

I'll keep posting here what we have come up with as we go along.

best regards
Mariusz
