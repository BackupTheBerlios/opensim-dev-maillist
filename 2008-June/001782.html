<PRE>Hi,

unfortunately, as I said in chat, that is not a possible solution.

Basically, Tedd and I pretty much concur what needs to be done, it's 
just not a solution as simple as that.

What happened is that more and more logic that belongs in 
DotNetEngine/ was put into Common/ for convenience, along with a 
couple of broken implementations that locked this structure pretty 
much into place.

This results in the &quot;Common&quot; assembly actually pulling most of 
DotNetEngine in, so Common/ currently can't be used to write another 
script engine - anything that touches Common/ becomes the 
DotNetEngine, pulling in it's event handling and AppDomain handling.

Also, all that stuff is loaded into the AppDomain. Megs of useless 
code, that, at best, never gets executed, at worst creates security 
holes.

Tedd and I are aware of the steps needed to re-merge the LSL 
implementations, which involves putting together a file from both 
LSL files, moving engine functionality out of Common/ back into 
DotNetEngine/, defining new interfaces and creating a new Common/ 
assembly from that, that contains only the code that actually needs 
to be loaded into the AppDomain, and not half the engine.

This is something that will be done, but can't be done just right 
away. So we agreed to carry on for a few more days as we were, while 
the options are looked at.

The fork happened because there was no way anyone would have let me 
make the changes to Common/ and DotNetEngine/ that are needed, in 
time for my deadlines. XEngine was not designed for inclusion, it 
was designed as a private patch.
Much positive resonance in IRC, from people who were happy to see a 
new script engine, made me submit those patches, resulting in two 
copies exiting in trunk.

So, I'm all for reintegration, and I don't want to be perceived as 
the one who is against it, I'm +1 myself!
