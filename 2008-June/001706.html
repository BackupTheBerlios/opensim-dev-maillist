All valid concerns.

&gt;<i> Therefore, I would argue that OpenSimulator should only include in
</I>&gt;<i> its core distribution support for a few scripting languages.  In my
</I>&gt;<i> opinion these would be LSL, maybe C# and possibly one other (maybe
</I>&gt;<i> Python). Support for other languages would come as optional plugins,
</I>&gt;<i> available either directly from the author or from some satellite
</I>&gt;<i> repository (perhaps similar to Perl's CPAN or PHP's PEAR).  I would

</I>&gt;<i> relatively lean and mean.
</I>
This would be the right way to go. Not sure whether a repository is
needed; can the module ecosystem be expected to grow to the size at
which it's best managed with a repository model?

&gt;<i> If necessary, I am happy to make any necessary infrastructure changes
</I>&gt;<i> to make language plugins possible/easier (which probably also means
</I>&gt;<i> making much needed enhancements to the plugin system).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do other people think?
</I>
I'm a fan of having the author host the code (on Google code, for
instance). Links can be put on the wiki for third party modules like
this.

Another benefit would be a clear separation of ownership. If there are
problems with the module, those using the module would direct their
questions and/or bugs to the author. Issues with third party modules
filed in Mantis can be promptly closed with a link/note on who to
contact instead.

Mike
