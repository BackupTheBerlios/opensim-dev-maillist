Let's seperate the use case you have, from the way you would implement
it on top of the existing system, which is wasteful in a bunch of ways.
The use case is to track inventory generations of the same asset.  I
think that would be much better done by adding a field to inventory
which is seeded on a new upload.  Inventory transfers/copies keep that
seed.

&gt;<i> Also, in the case of a hash collision (same hash for different 
</I>&gt;<i> items), the uploader would be getting my texture instead of his, not 
</I>&gt;<i> what he wants. He would basically be handed a full perm copy of a 
</I>&gt;<i> texture I may have taken hours to create.
</I>
This isn't a viable attack unless you are the NSA, and have a lot of
years to burn (even with all published weakenings in SHA1).  So unless
you think the government is after your textures, don't worry about this
case.

&gt;<i> So, since duplicate prevention is not proper to attempt, hashing 
</I>&gt;<i> seems pointless.
</I>
Making assets content addressable storage would be very useful,
especially for large scale installations.  To read up more on the entire
space, the wikipedia entry is pretty good:

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
