<PRE>Hi Justin,

Thanks for your reply.
I agree... I've had this happen to me a time or two in the past with 
other projects and have solved it by making a new folder and simply 
starting over with a fresh unmolested copy.
But, As I mentioned.... I've already tried this route... I did get 
different results... Still had 88 warnings.. but no errors.

I've been trying for a few hours this morning to get things back on 
track... but I can't figure this out...I'm stuck..dead in the water.

I've not changed anything on my end... I've checked all my settings in 
2005 Express and RealXtend still builds fine so I don't think my 
settings in 2005 Express are wrong.
I can't figure it out.

-Terry
