<PRE>I think the goal for user ban was mostly for Grid Admin purposes, im not
sure i like the idea of grid users being able to initiate a grid wide ban..
our goal was more to give grid admins the ability to initiate a grid ban,
perhaps some kind of password should be required if a ban is initiated at a
console, but again only be able to be done by a grid admin, not just
anyone.   Also last 24 hours the SVN now has the ability to ban on the
parcel level and it is enforced.  So we do have a good tool now for grid
citizens and sim owners.   Also as another note we have begun incorporating
IP capture into OpenSIM Web Interface and the ability to disable accounts on
the grid as well as prevent that user from visiting the website if you so
choose, these are easily overcome by people with knowledge, but its better
than not having any ability.. So if you would like to experiment with
opensimwi you can grab a copy at the website
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensimwiredux">http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensimwiredux</A> these mods are still very
young and will evolve over time, id like to hear everyones thoughts on
things that could be implemented into the Web Interface to get a better
grasp on security.  Thanks
