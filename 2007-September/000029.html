<PRE>Hi

 

I need to gather some views on something I&#8217;ve been thinking of for a while now.

I&#8217;m considering the benefits and drawbacks of moving the scriptengine to a separate .EXE, running as a daemon.

 

The advantage is that a script can be running on a different computer than the sim itself. This can be used to protect IP (source code) and to offload the actual server.

 

Protecting IP can be everything from someone wanting to stop untrusted servers from getting their code, to a company selling and hosting scripts (like a &#8220;script for rent&#8221;-company). Offloading the servers is anyway good since they will be quite busy with physics and stuff. If you want really complex scripts then you can run a cluster of machines.

 

Also a running script would not have to be moved between regions, it can just contact the next region as the avatar does.

 

 

Separating scriptengine from the sim would require a separation of LSL commands.

Any command that does not manipulate or gather information about the region or its objects/avs can be executed by the scriptengine. Any command that does so will have to communicate using some sort of network protocol, for example remoting.

 

I need inputs on how much traffic this would cause. Overhead? Advantages? Drawbacks? Showstoppers?

What do you think?

 

Sincerely,

 Tedd
