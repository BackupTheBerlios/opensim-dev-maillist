grhm. And I think now I even remember the discussion we had on IRC a while
ago - when the &quot;local regions&quot; came into notion in the first place. Sorry
for a little bit of plagiarism, indeed I think this was my brain taking too
long to digest your idea, and it tried to mask it - next time we should meet
in brussels, so I could pay some royalties in beers   :-)


just for a laugh, I've implemented so that the OGS Grid comms now have a
&gt;<i> Local Grid comm, and forwards all requests to it to see if it can be handled
</I>&gt;<i> locally, if not, it accesses the grid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Ahha! interesting :) is it in SVN or the private patch ?


The latter has a 'RegionInfo' cache, and a 'RegionListener' cache (which is
&gt;<i> the remoting endpoints for the regions within the instance)

</I>&gt;<i> I think we can get this really nice with a bit of love and quite some

Yup! OGS seems to be a bit less rewarding area to play with - since you need
all the associated overhead (UGA).

I think eventually we should arrive to what you had mentioned - there's no
&quot;standalone&quot; or &quot;distributed&quot; mode anymore - by default everything runs
local, and then by config tweaks one could delegate certain tasks to
external servers, therefore making the setup &quot;distributed&quot;.

Although the further it goes, the more I am getting convinced that the true
&quot;distributed&quot; setup should not assume the centralized UGA - but rather
permit them to be mix-n-matched.

Which will bring to the two second-phase questions to solve:

1) user identity in the fully decentralized  environment
2) inventory management in such an environment.

But probably it is more interesting to first have a functional and working
in the wild the code to at least see these two :)

I can imagine that even with these unresolved, the &quot;teleports&quot; could be
still of quite some value - at least you can &quot;visit&quot; the other sims.
