<PRE>Just to be exact : the application pool is a per-process thing; one application can run many regions. This is the source of the current situation where one client can hog 9 threads in the application - one for each region it's connected to. Which will scale VERY poorly.
 
So yeah; moving towards 'units of work' and one shared threadpool would be a good thing for many reasons.

Hi
 
&gt;<i> How would the thread pool help ? IMHO the threads should be per-region, not per-client - then the number of threads would be quite limited.Ok, I can see that I may not have been clear in my communications, sorry about that. What I was trying to say was that, IMO is this:
</I> 
1) I think that the current codebase, having a lot of different strategies for handling threading is makes the code harder to read.
2) That Threadpools, were designed into the .NET framework, to assist in creating multithreaded applications, without introducing the overhead of an application having a lot of threads (creating, destroying and switching threads)
 
To my knowledge, each application domain has a separate threadpool, consequently I believe that the threadpool is a per-region thing.
