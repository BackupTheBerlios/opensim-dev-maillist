<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;but even with those two still unkilled, like I wrote to Stefan - still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;there might be quite some value from being able to at least visit other
</I>&gt;<i> sim
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think identiy and inventory should be solveable
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Identity can be handled as a distributed trust scenario, much like the way
</I>&gt;<i> PGP operates, meaning if I trust Peter and Peter trusts Alice, then it is
</I>&gt;<i> very likely that I would trust Alice too. This could be arranged with
</I>&gt;<i> digitally signed certificates, possibly X509, but we don't have to use an
</I>&gt;<i> official one, but the advantages to using a public certificate is obvious.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So intially I will create a certificate on my own, and sign it my self. I
</I>&gt;<i> then meet Peter, we become friends, and we sign each others certificats.
</I>&gt;<i> This way my identity is defined by the people I know. A user server would
</I>&gt;<i> then allow access, not based on a username password scenario, but on a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;who
</I>&gt;<i> has signed the certificate basis&quot;.
</I>

yes.  I think we are in sync here.
<A HREF="http://daltonic.blogspot.com/2007/09/free-identity-or-how-to-combat-griefing.html">http://daltonic.blogspot.com/2007/09/free-identity-or-how-to-combat-griefing.html</A>


On to inventory (and asset storage)
&gt;<i> I believe that we should - via the plugins - make it possible to store the
</I>&gt;<i> inventories and assets in a distributed environment, where each user hosts
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> an asset server and an inventory server. This server should store a
</I>&gt;<i> personal
</I>&gt;<i> inventory and a copy of the assets referenced by the inventory items. This
</I>&gt;<i> way the inventory can follow the user across grids, and nobody would have
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> host a huge asset store.
</I>

yes, again. I had in my mind the concept of &quot;home sim&quot; - the place where you
are &quot;registered&quot;. (could be a field in the certificate, or such). Then in
the simplest case we could have the assets stored either within the same sim
(to allow the plug-and-play operation for the majority of the users, who do
not have a lot of registrations on their sim anyway) - or to allow direct
reference onto a separate server, which would store the assets, with the
&quot;home sim&quot; possibly being a commercial entity providing this as a hosting
service to their users.

Everyone should have at least their own inventory stored locally. Whether or
not this would be backed by a DHT is another story. In the ideal world, yes,
something like GLACIER ( <A HREF="http://epostmail.org/technical.html">http://epostmail.org/technical.html</A>) might be nice
(it claims the 6-nines availability in the case of 60% correlated node
failure) - but this would be also a rather slow media, so the biggest reason
to use it as a &quot;distributed backup&quot; - you reinstall the sim, and assuming
that you have kept your private key/cert pair, then you can suck all of your
data back in upon the restart.
