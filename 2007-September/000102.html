That would also be an option, to check in the nant files and only use
prebuild for VS generation.  That would currently require updating both
prebuild.xml and nant files when files were added or moved, which is a
little less than ideal, but would start moving us in the right
direction.

Ideally there would be a nant target to natively take nant files and
make MS project files, but that doesn't appear to exist anywhere.
Anyone that would write that would be my hero, as it would let us have
our cake and eat it too. :)

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
