Agreed.  I think we've got a couple too many layers of inheritance in
the current chain.  I'm always happy when people remove some of them. :)

&gt;<i> We have 2-3-4 different DB plugins (SQLLite and MySQL probably being
</I>&gt;<i> more complete and stable), If you examine both the MySql and SQLite
</I>&gt;<i> plugins, they are again staggered into a hierarchy of logic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So if you tweak the local comms layer to attempt a local access first, and then divert to OGS in case you fail, you risk:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Duplicating the decision of wheter to uses local or OGS in two different layers of the application
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Introduce - atleast increased -latency in the network
</I>&gt;<i> communications, and that will cause the lag monster to appear.
</I>
Agreed.  I think our current model on walking through a list of loaded
plugins to do calls around the DB stuff is not good.  We really need to
pick one at load time, and that's our guy.

&gt;<i> I am pretty worried, we have a very flexible engine, with a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically loaded assemblies, which - atleast on Microsoft -  will
</I>&gt;<i> produce less than optimum compiled code, and we generally use a very
</I>&gt;<i> inefficient network comms protocol (XML-RPC and REST). How can we get
</I>&gt;<i> that to perform well?
</I>
Does the JIT really care if you are loading code on runtime?  Any
reference to performance information there would be appreciated.

&gt;<i> I would suggest that we:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Use .NET remoting for all our communications, out of the box .NET
</I>&gt;<i> comes with TCP, HTTP and IPC channels. IPC is designed to be a local
</I>&gt;<i> machine interprocess communications protocol. TCP and HTTP should be
</I>&gt;<i> pretty self explanatory. The format of the messages can be controlled
</I>&gt;<i> via formatters, out of the box .NET supports binary and SOAP, but an
</I>&gt;<i> XML-RPC formatter is freely available.
</I>
The LL model is going to evolve into REST for communication to the Agent
Domain / Region Domain communication
(<A HREF="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Proposed_Architecture">http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Proposed_Architecture</A>).  Using .NET
remoting for things outside of that (like Region &lt;-&gt; Region
communication) is a win, but we want to make sure not to evolve in a
completely incompatible way with where LL is going.

&gt;<i> 2) Drop local mode.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we switch to a complete remoting based communications protocol, it will be possible to use high performance IPC remoting if we are running in stand alone mode, and stil delegate communications on a per server basis via the config files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This way stand alone mode, is merely a question of using the right
</I>&gt;<i> configuration. The gains are that we reduce the comlexity of the
</I>&gt;<i> codebase by removing all the local comms stuff. and remove one layer
</I>&gt;<i> of abstraction.
</I>
+1 on this approach.  If we can get local IPC fast enough, getting rid
of an extra layer of logic for us would be a good thing.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
