I think that is a quite good idea, it actually somewhat meshes with
something I was thinking about this weekend around having region
packages, to make it easy to bundle up regions and share them with your
friends.

I think we should think about the whole thing in a slightly larger
content of:
 
 * Regions
 * Prims
 * Textures
 * Assets

Where it would be easy to bundle up one or more of these into some sort
of package which was loaded into the environment on startup.  Being able
to export a current environment like this would help with the case where
I sent danx0r my environment so he could figure out the grass colision
issue, and would also make for the easiest way to dupe your world for a
friend.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
