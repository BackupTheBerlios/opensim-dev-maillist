<PRE>Hi

I think this discussion was started, based on a patch I made, which didn't 
really work on linux, mostly because I use a windows x64 machine for 
development and libsecondlife+openjpeg+sqllite isn't compatible with my 
system. libsecondlife needs to be atleast r 1400 in order for OpenSim to 
execute on Win 64.

The pain of providing working patches from my system to opensim is simply 
too big, about an hours work to regress back to pre-1400 version of 
libsecondlife, and then the code cannot execute on my computer, meaning that 
I can only validate if the patch compiles. So I have kind of given op on 
contributing to the OpenSim core. At least until OpenSim has been upgraded 
and supports r 1400 or we have a more generic built system in place.

I would still like to contribute to this project, because I feel that 
OpenSim is the best idea in opensource in a long time. As things are right 
now, I will try to focus on a .NET remoting formatter for LLSD. That way we 
can leverage .net remoting when using the LLSD format.

LLSD seems to be the format LL will be using moving forward. In the interest 
of making things a little more generic, I think we should name our 
implementation SLSD.
