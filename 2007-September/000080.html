<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> p.s. I do not open yet the can of worms with the inventory, etc. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yeh, I can imagine that wil be a lot of worms. ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>actually, I think just two, but they are incredibly fat: identity + 
</I>&gt;<i>inventory :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>but even with those two still unkilled, like I wrote to Stefan - still 
</I>&gt;<i>there might be quite some value from being able to at least visit other sim

I don't think identiy and inventory should be solveable

Identity can be handled as a distributed trust scenario, much like the way 
PGP operates, meaning if I trust Peter and Peter trusts Alice, then it is 
very likely that I would trust Alice too. This could be arranged with 
digitally signed certificates, possibly X509, but we don't have to use an 
official one, but the advantages to using a public certificate is obvious.

So intially I will create a certificate on my own, and sign it my self. I 
then meet Peter, we become friends, and we sign each others certificats. 
This way my identity is defined by the people I know. A user server would 
then allow access, not based on a username password scenario, but on a &quot;who 
has signed the certificate basis&quot;.

On to inventory (and asset storage)
I believe that we should - via the plugins - make it possible to store the 
inventories and assets in a distributed environment, where each user hosts a 
an asset server and an inventory server. This server should store a personal 
inventory and a copy of the assets referenced by the inventory items. This 
way the inventory can follow the user across grids, and nobody would have to 
host a huge asset store.
