Hmm, but if you need just to dupe the environment for the friend - at least
in the current standalone edition - that's quite easy - just tar the
datafiles and then send them over..  (or, for other databases, this would
probably mean making the dump of the entire tables).

I think the export of the part of the inventory and export of the part of
the environment are similar to an extent that in both cases one would need
to fetch also some dependent elements - but but the handling would be quite
different.

Although, now that I think of it - the inventory transfer functions might be
also interesting for my &quot;idee fixe&quot; of crosslinked standalone sims...
(even though the proper handling of that one would be touching the questions
of identity, for specifics of which I am not ready at this point :)
