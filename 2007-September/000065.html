<PRE>Folks,

wanted to check your opinion on this.

I've slowly started hacking up the code to try out my idea of &quot;friendly
teleports&quot;.

The way I am playing with it is by making the &quot;hybrid backend services&quot; - a
backend services class has the LocalBackEndServices as a class member, first
redirects all of the calls to it, and then handles the &quot;failure&quot; cases  in
InformRegionOfChildAgent, ExpectAvatarCrossing, AcknowledgeAgentCrossed,
RequestNeighbourInfo.

The latter retrieves the regioninfo from the &quot;remote regions cache&quot; - hash
indexed by the regionid, which would need to be populated within the flow of
the said os* function.

The rationale for making the &quot;overlay class&quot; is to avoid the duplication of
the functionality of  &quot;same-server&quot; functions which are there already in the
local backend services - and have just the &quot;intergrid&quot; functions using the
remoting which I snarf from the OGS1 backend services code.

Since the regionhandle seems to be quite tied to the grid coordinates, I am
thinking of the following scheme:

1) I add a new os* function, which would take the URL of the sim + the
coordinates as the parameter. (could be a PATH_INFO-like scheme, i.e.:
<A HREF="http://sim-domain-name/path_to_handler_or_sim_name_in_case_of_grid/x/y/z">http://sim-domain-name/path_to_handler_or_sim_name_in_case_of_grid/x/y/z</A>

2) when the user script calls this function, the source sim A retrieves the
info about the destination sim (grid) B via this URL (the mainly interesting
stuff for the current implementation is the remoting IP/port) - but might
change in the future. This is the point where the user might get a dialog
box &quot;do you want to teleport to ...&quot;

3) A and B need to negotiate a &quot;temporary&quot; regionHandle, which would be
unused in both sims (grids).

3a) A sends a request with the proposed region handle to sim B
3b) if this regionhandle is ok - then B responds to it, else it responds
with &quot;NAK&quot;, and proposes its own region handle.
3c) A does the same - if still not ok, selects the new temp region handle
and the story repeats. If after N attempts we do not succeed, the teleport
is declared as failed. If it succeeds, then both A and B have in the cache
the info about the temporary handle.

4) the user is sent to the target sim B using the
scene.RequestTeleportLocation()

5) once the user arrives, the sim (grid) B initiates a second teleport to
the &quot;real&quot; region and signals back to sim (grid) A that the temporary
location there can be cleared.

once the teleport succeeds, the sim(grid) B clears the temporary location as
well. The temporary locations would be probably cutting off the chunk of the
topmost X/Y coordinates.

This is a raw idea, I still need to test it further, but I think it might
work..

/d

p.s. I do not open yet the can of worms with the inventory, etc. :)
