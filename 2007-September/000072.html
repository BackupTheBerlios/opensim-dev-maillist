<PRE>Dalien (and others)
 
the 'hybrid backend service' you are talking about sounds very much like the 'Service/Manager' pattern I have been advocatong for quite some while now;
 
just for a laugh, I've implemented so that the OGS Grid comms now have a Local Grid comm, and forwards all requests to it to see if it can be handled locally, if not, it accesses the grid.
 
The latter has a 'RegionInfo' cache, and a 'RegionListener' cache (which is the remoting endpoints for the regions within the instance)
 
I think we can get this really nice with a bit of love and quite some patience.

Date: Tue, 25 Sep 2007 03:36:59 +0200From: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">dalienta at gmail.comTo</A>: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">opensim-dev at lists.berlios.deSubject</A>: [Opensim-dev] &quot;Friendly teleports&quot; between the standalone simsFolks, wanted to check your opinion on this.I've slowly started hacking up the code to try out my idea of &quot;friendly teleports&quot;.The way I am playing with it is by making the &quot;hybrid backend services&quot; - a backend services class has the LocalBackEndServices as a class member, first redirects all of the calls to it, and then handles the &quot;failure&quot; cases  in InformRegionOfChildAgent, ExpectAvatarCrossing, AcknowledgeAgentCrossed, RequestNeighbourInfo. The latter retrieves the regioninfo from the &quot;remote regions cache&quot; - hash indexed by the regionid, which would need to be populated within the flow of the said os* function.The rationale for making the &quot;overlay class&quot; is to avoid the duplication of the functionality of  &quot;same-server&quot; functions which are there already in the local backend services - and have just the &quot;intergrid&quot; functions using the remoting which I snarf from the OGS1 backend services code. Since the regionhandle seems to be quite tied to the grid coordinates, I am thinking of the following scheme:1) I add a new os* function, which would take the URL of the sim + the coordinates as the parameter. (could be a PATH_INFO-like scheme, i.e.: <A HREF="http://sim-domain-name/path_to_handler_or_sim_name_in_case_of_grid/x/y/z2">http://sim-domain-name/path_to_handler_or_sim_name_in_case_of_grid/x/y/z2</A>) when the user script calls this function, the source sim A retrieves the info about the destination sim (grid) B via this URL (the mainly interesting stuff for the current implementation is the remoting IP/port) - but might change in the future. This is the point where the user might get a dialog box &quot;do you want to teleport to ...&quot; 3) A and B need to negotiate a &quot;temporary&quot; regionHandle, which would be unused in both sims (grids). 3a) A sends a request with the proposed region handle to sim B3b) if this regionhandle is ok - then B responds to it, else it responds with &quot;NAK&quot;, and proposes its own region handle. 3c) A does the same - if still not ok, selects the new temp region handle and the story repeats. If after N attempts we do not succeed, the teleport is declared as failed. If it succeeds, then both A and B have in the cache the info about the temporary handle. 4) the user is sent to the target sim B using the scene.RequestTeleportLocation()5) once the user arrives, the sim (grid) B initiates a second teleport to the &quot;real&quot; region and signals back to sim (grid) A that the temporary location there can be cleared. once the teleport succeeds, the sim(grid) B clears the temporary location as well. The temporary locations would be probably cutting off the chunk of the topmost X/Y coordinates.This is a raw idea, I still need to test it further, but I think it might work.. /dp.s. I do not open yet the can of worms with the inventory, etc. :)
