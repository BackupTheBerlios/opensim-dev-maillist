<PRE>in the case of ODE, the build is quite a complex little beast of its own. 
Are you suggesting that we duplicate the work of these native builds, or is
it more like a meta-build that knows how to get the source, run ./configure,
make install, etc?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, in order to do this, we'd need to do significantly more with
</I>&gt;<i> our build system.  Which means I think we need to revisit the current
</I>&gt;<i> approach on the build system.  Right now there is the meta build system
</I>&gt;<i> of Prebuild that generates very basic build files for msbuild and nant.
</I>&gt;<i> Doing something as complicated as native code through this kind of

</I>&gt;<i> If we were to consider a pure nant based solution here (as nant is cross
</I>&gt;<i> platform) we could actually integrate all of this (and as I'm suggesting
</I>&gt;<i> this approach, would take on the responsibility of making this work).
</I>&gt;<i> It would also open up the ability to do prechecks prior to build (look
</I>&gt;<i> for old mono, missing libraries, etc), and integration of nunit tests.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know this degrades some of the experience of MS VS developers.  Not
</I>&gt;<i> being one, I'm not sure how to quantify losses on that front vs. gains
</I>&gt;<i> on solving a lot of these other issues we're getting on a regular basis
</I>&gt;<i> on IRC.  Hopefully others can comment there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a proposal for group discussion.  Please fire back with
