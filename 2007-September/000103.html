<PRE>As I understand it, libsl (since that's what's been problematic lately) ships both nant build files and vs projects; it should be trivial to include those ready-shipped build recipes into our builds.
 
(Surely it would be trivial to do a default.build that first do libsecondlife.build, moves the files to the right dir, then does an opensim.build?)
 
We (I) could surely tweak prebuild to include a shipped vs project into the generated vs solution.
 
So, we'd ship the libsl source ( one certain rev ) with the opensim source, but not re-gen the nant/vs build files for it, merely include those that are shipped.
 
Would that solve anything?

I have no&gt; &gt; idea how they maintain it.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; www.ode.org&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also maybe I'm not understanding things, but if prebuild is good for&gt; &gt; generating vsproj &amp;/| .sln files, and nant is good for everything else, why&gt; &gt; not call prebuild from nant, instead of the other way around?&gt; &gt; That would also be an option, to check in the nant files and only use&gt; prebuild for VS generation. That would currently require updating both&gt; prebuild.xml and nant files when files were added or moved, which is a&gt; little less than ideal, but would start moving us in the right&gt; direction.&gt; &gt; Ideally there would be a nant target to natively take nant files and&gt; make MS project files, but that doesn't appear to exist anywhere.&gt; Anyone that would write that would be my hero, as it would let us have&gt; our cake and eat it too. :)&gt; &gt; -Sean&gt; &gt; -- &gt; __________________________________________________________________&gt; &gt; Sean Dague Mid-Hudson Valley&gt; sean at dague dot net Linux Users Group&gt; <A HREF="http://dague.net">http://dague.net</A> <A HREF="http://mhvlug.org">http://mhvlug.org</A>&gt; &gt; There is no silver bullet.
