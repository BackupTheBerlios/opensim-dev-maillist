<PRE>Ok, so now I've started working on a Region layer.
 
Right now, the paradigm is that I have a 'Region' with 'RegionSubscribers' that has IClientAPI clients that are interested in what's going on in the region.
 
I've created some very loopy code to emulate having a list of these Subscribers (by extracting them from Scene.GetScenePresences which is reeeeally bad performance-wise) so that I can write the code as if we had it.
 
The RegionManager only has one function, 'Broadcast' that is meant to apply a delegate action on all clients that are interested in what's happening in the region.
 
I've actually done some progress; as it stands, you can now see what code immediately should go into the Region Layer (if a functionality can use Broadcast, it's a part of the Region layer)
 
next step is to keep track of an 'actual' m_regionSubscribers by adding and removing clients as they are connecting and disconnecting.
 
Then, somewhere in the not-too-distant future, I hope we can cut down the m_scenePresences to just avatars, adding and removing them as they are moving into and out of the _scene_.
