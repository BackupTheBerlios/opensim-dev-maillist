<PRE>Melanie,

When a bug is found in open-source software, it is expected that it
won't be fixed unless and until a bug tracker entry shows up in
whatever tracker is used -- at Sourceforge, it's the Tracker.  For
OpenSim, it's Mantis.

if you've been aware of the issue forever, why didn't you file the bug
in Mantis?

What's the point of having a bug-tracking system when developers only
use it to accept and filter bug reports from external sources, without
any intra-team discussion -- or even mention of it to the user
community?  What's the point of searching for unwanted behavior in
Mantis, when the development team doesn't use it?

Isn't it the responsibility of the original bug-finder to document it,
so that people who haven't run into it but who wish to contribute have
some idea of where to look for things to do?

If it isn't, then why is this project still struggling along?

If it is... then you have been derelict in your duties as
developer/committer, have you not?

[note: &quot;If you don't like it, stop using it, we're not paid, we're
just here to have fun&quot; is not an adequate answer to this.  If you've
known about a material bug &quot;forever&quot; (quoting you), and you never
mentioned it or filed a report on it, you're delinquent in your
thoughts about what okay to avoid telling anyone about.  If I were
running this project, you wouldn't be on the project -- no matter how
much you contribute otherwise -- because the primary focus is
COMMUNICATION.  Communication via protocol between a client and server
relies on two aspects of protocol: the first is explicit protocol,
which is the bits that go on the wire.  The second is implicit
protocol, which is the mechanism by which all data that must be sent
via the explicit protocol is identified so that all viewers behave
appropriately.]

To restate: You have identified a bug in implicit protocol handling.
You've known about this bug &quot;forever&quot;.  You failed to tell anyone
about it.  You failed to file a mantis about it.  You even failed to
ACKNOWLEDGE the bug except now, on the list.

Your actions have materially harmed user acceptance of OpenSim.
Therefore, I request an answer: Why are you trying to sabotage the
project?

&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> this is different from the reported bug, which was that avatars log
</I>&gt;<i> in in T-Pose. This also happens on the LL grid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, avatars already in-sim should be correctly displayed to new
</I>&gt;<i> joiners.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a long-standing issue. It is caused by the current animation
</I>&gt;<i> pack not being sent to new observers. On the LL grid, when an avatar
</I>&gt;<i> first comes into view, the anim pack is sent to the new observer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are, however, currently not tracking &quot;seen&quot; root agents per
</I>&gt;<i> client, as we should, so we don't have the data to decide when to
</I>&gt;<i> send the anim pack. Because of that, we send it only when it changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This issue is distinct from the bug I closed. Please do NOT reopen
</I>&gt;<i> that bug, as it doesn't apply to what you're seeing. This is a
</I>&gt;<i> different behavior and I'm not aware of an exsting Mantis, although
</I>&gt;<i> I've been aware of the issue foerever.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is an issue we have when using libomv and the OpenSim

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our bots log into OpenSim in a T position, and they do not log in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a T position on the LL grid. The same libomv software is used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in both instances. What is the reason for the difference? I had thought
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it was, perhaps, that the LL server was keeping track of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current animation state; however, one of the OpenSim devs says that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is not so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With OpenSim, the problem is that whenever a new human-driven
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client logs into OpenSim, the libomv-driven bot appears as a T pose.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One must continually change the animation state of the bot to get the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bot out of the T pose for arbitary human clients who log in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We have rigged a few OpenSim bots using repeated animations;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> however, for the bots that are in a seating position on a bus,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the problem doesn't appear to be fixable--having a bot reseat itself every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> second or so is awkward and would appear unnatural. Using an eye
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> animation doesn't do the trick of reseating the bot either.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the LL grid, we have many seated bots and LL knows to reseat these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bots for each human client without animation override.
