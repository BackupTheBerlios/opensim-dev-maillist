<PRE>I don't plan to reopen that bug; however, would you recommend me to
open up a new mantis? It is certainly a significant problem for us.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this is different from the reported bug, which was that avatars log
</I>&gt;<i> in in T-Pose. This also happens on the LL grid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, avatars already in-sim should be correctly displayed to new
</I>&gt;<i> joiners.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a long-standing issue. It is caused by the current animation
</I>&gt;<i> pack not being sent to new observers. On the LL grid, when an avatar
</I>&gt;<i> first comes into view, the anim pack is sent to the new observer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are, however, currently not tracking &quot;seen&quot; root agents per
</I>&gt;<i> client, as we should, so we don't have the data to decide when to
</I>&gt;<i> send the anim pack. Because of that, we send it only when it changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This issue is distinct from the bug I closed. Please do NOT reopen
</I>&gt;<i> that bug, as it doesn't apply to what you're seeing. This is a
</I>&gt;<i> different behavior and I'm not aware of an exsting Mantis, although
</I>&gt;<i> I've been aware of the issue foerever.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is an issue we have when using libomv and the OpenSim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server, and I am not sure where the problem lies. The issue is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our bots log into OpenSim in a T position, and they do not log in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a T position on the LL grid. The same libomv software is used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in both instances. What is the reason for the difference? I had thought
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it was, perhaps, that the LL server was keeping track of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current animation state; however, one of the OpenSim devs says that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is not so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With OpenSim, the problem is that whenever a new human-driven
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client logs into OpenSim, the libomv-driven bot appears as a T pose.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One must continually change the animation state of the bot to get the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bot out of the T pose for arbitary human clients who log in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We have rigged a few OpenSim bots using repeated animations;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> however, for the bots that are in a seating position on a bus,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the problem doesn't appear to be fixable--having a bot reseat itself every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> second or so is awkward and would appear unnatural. Using an eye
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> animation doesn't do the trick of reseating the bot either.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the LL grid, we have many seated bots and LL knows to reseat these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bots for each human client without animation override.
