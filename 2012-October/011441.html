<PRE>Regarding the groups work, I have now implemented an OpenSimulator experimental option, MessageOnlineUsersOnly in 
[Groups] as of git master 1937e5f.  When set to true this will only send group IMs to online users.  This does not 
require a groups service update.  I believe OSGrid is going to test this more extensively soon though it appears to work 
fine on Wright Plaza.

It's temporarily a little spammy on the console right now (what isn't!) with a debug message that says how many online 
users it is sending to and how long a send takes.

Unlike Michelle's solution, this works by querying the Presence service for online users, though it also caches this 
data to avoid hitting the presence service too hard.

Even though I implemented this, I'm not convinced that it's the best way to go - I think Michelle's approach of sending 
login/logoff status directly from simulator to groups service could still be better.  My chief concern with the groups 
approach is the potential inconsistency between online status stored there and in the Presence service.  However, this 
could be a non-issue.  Need to give it more thought.

</I>&gt;<i> This is a task which should be done centrally in case of OSgrid in Dallas TX (

</I>
That concentrates all distribution on a central point rather than spreading it amongst simulators.  Then OSGrid has the 
problem of scaling this up.

Having said that, there are advantages to funnelling things through a reliable central point.  As to which is better is 
a complicated engineering issue - the kind of which there are many in the MMO/VW space.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But there are even other places which can and should be improved. I did some tests with some viewers counting the web
</I>&gt;<i> requests to the central infrastructure:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Test 1: Teleport from a Plaza to one of my regions located on a server in Europe and afterwards logging out:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cool VL Viewer: 912 Requests mostly SynchronousRestForms POST <A HREF="http://presence.osgrid.org/presence">http://presence.osgrid.org/presence</A> ( i guess to inform
</I>&gt;<i> all my 809 friends [mostly only 5% online] I am going offline because the calls to the presence service were done after
</I>&gt;<i> i closed the viewer)
</I>&gt;<i> Singularity Veiwer: 921 Requests mostly calls to presence after logoff
</I>&gt;<i> Teapot viewer: 910 Requests mostly calls to presence after logoff
</I>&gt;<i> Astra Viewer: 917 Requests mostly calls to presence after logoff
</I>&gt;<i> Firestorm: 1005 Requests mostly calls to presence after logoff
</I>&gt;<i> Imprudence: 918 mostly calls to presence after logoff
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So far so good. I have no idea why my 760 offline friends have to be informed that I went offline ...
</I>&gt;<i> (Details can be found here: <A HREF="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B301xueh1kxdNG1wLWo2YVVfYjA">https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B301xueh1kxdNG1wLWo2YVVfYjA</A> )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Test 2: Direct Login onto my Region and then Logoff-( with FetchInventory2 disabled )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cool VL Viewer: 2232 Requests mostly calls to presence ~800 during login and ~800 during logout and xinventory
</I>&gt;<i> Singularity Viwer: 2340 Requests mostly calls to presence and xinventory
</I>&gt;<i> Teapot Viewer: Produced 500+ Threads in a very short time and then the OpenSim.exe crashed
</I>&gt;<i> Astra Viewer: 2831 Request mostly calls to presence and xinventory
</I>&gt;<i> Firestorm Viwer: ACK Timeout for me. OpenSim.exe survived on 500 Threads for 30+ minutes producing 4996 Requests mostly
</I>&gt;<i> xinventory
</I>&gt;<i> Imprudence: 1745 Requests mostly presence
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again why do all my 809 friends have do be verified with single requests? Then why this difference in xinventory
</I>&gt;<i> Requests? And why are both Teapot and Firestorm producing so many Threads in such a short time? and bring OpenSim.exe to
</I>&gt;<i> crash or closely to crash ...
</I>&gt;<i> ( Details can be found here: <A HREF="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B301xueh1kxdMDJxWm5UR2QtU2c">https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B301xueh1kxdMDJxWm5UR2QtU2c</A> )
</I>
The presence information is useful data and it was possible in git master commit da2b23f to change the Friends module to 
fetch all presence data in one call for status notification when a user goes on/offline, rather than make a separate 
call for each friend.

This should be more efficient since only the latency and resources of one call is required.  However, since each friend 
still has to be messaged separately to tell them of the status change I'm not sure how much practical effect this will have.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Test 3: Direct Login to my Region with FetchInventory2 enabled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Teapot Viewer: I closed the viwer after 30 minutes. Number of Threads were still rising up to 260. In the end i counted
</I>&gt;<i> 30634 xinventory requests... My Inventory has 14190 items !!!
</I>&gt;<i> Firestorm Viwer: Quite normal approx 2020 Requests ... quite some slow FetchInventoryDescendandts2 Caps. with 100 sec max
</I>
Regarding inventory service, unfortunately many viewers appear to behave very aggressively when fetching inventory 
information.  For instance, I'm told that if you have certain types of AO enabled - some viewers will fetch your entire 
inventory.  The LL infrastructure may be able to cope with this but the more modest machines running grids can have 
trouble, it seems.

I'm not sure what the long term solution is.  I suspect it's possible to greatly increase inventory fetch efficiency, 
possibly by some kind of call batching.  Or perhaps there's some viewer-side caching that OpenSimulator isn't working 
with properly.

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi Michelle.  I've now had some more time to think about this.  In fact, I established a proposal summary page at
</I>&gt;<i>     [1] which I'll change as we go along (or please feel free to change yourself).  We do need to fix this problem of
</I>&gt;<i>     group IM taking massive time with groups that aren't that big.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I do like the approach of caching online status (and login time) in the groups service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     1.  It's reasonably simple.
</I>&gt;<i>     2.  One network call to fetch online group members per IM.
</I>&gt;<i>     3.  May allow messaging across multiple OpenSimulator installations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     However, this approach does mean
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     1.  Independently updating the groups services on each login/logout.  I'm not saying this is a problem, particularly
</I>&gt;<i>     if it saves traffic later on.
</I>&gt;<i>     2.  Groups service has to deal with extra information.  Again, this is fairly simple so not necessarily a fatal
</I>&gt;<i>     issue though it does mean every groups implementations needs to do this in some manner.
</I>&gt;<i>     3.  Online cache is not reusable by other services in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     On a technical note, the XmlRpc groups module does in theory cache data for 30 seconds by default, so a change in
</I>&gt;<i>     online status may not be seen for upto 30 seconds.  I personally think that this is a reasonable tradeoff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Rather, of the above cons, 3 is the one I'm finding most serious.  If other services would also benefit from online
</I>&gt;<i>     status caching in the future, they would have to implement their own caches (and be updated from simulators).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I do agree that making a GridUser.LoggedIn() call for every single group member on every single IM is unworkable.
</I>&gt;<i>       Even if this is only done once and cached for a certain period of time it could be a major issue for large groups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So an alternative approach could be to add a new call to GridUser service (maybe LoggedIn(List&lt;UUID&gt;) that will only
</I>&gt;<i>     return GridInfo for those that are logged in.  This could then be cached simulator-side for a certain period of time
</I>&gt;<i>     (e.g. 30 seconds like the groups information) and used for group IM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     This has the advantages that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     1.  Groups and future services don't need to do their own login caching.
</I>&gt;<i>     2.  Future services can use the same information and code rather than have to cache login information themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     However, it does
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     1.  Require GridUserInfo caching simulator-side, I would judge this to be a more complex approach.
</I>&gt;<i>     2.  Mean that during the cache period, new online group messages will not receive messages.  (this is going to
</I>&gt;<i>     happen with GetGroupMembers() caching anyway).
</I>&gt;<i>     3.  Traffic is still generated to the GridUser service at the end of every simulator-side caching period.  This is
</I>&gt;<i>     probably not a huge burden.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So right now, I'm somewhat more in favour of a GridUserInfo simulator-side caching approach than caching login
</I>&gt;<i>     information within the groups service.  However, unlike you, I haven't actually tried to implement this approach so
</I>&gt;<i>     there may well be issues that I haven't seen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     What do you think, Michelle (or anybody else)?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Hi Michelle... I am looking at what is needed to update the Openvue grid which is using the flotsam XmlRpcGroups
</I>&gt;<i>             module.  the GITHub repository has the changes from a few days ago... but I wonder if there has been an
</I>&gt;<i>             update/commit
</I>&gt;<i>             into the main Opensim Github area already.  I cannot see a  related commit looking back over the last week
</I>&gt;<i>             or so.  Is
</I>&gt;<i>             the core system updated so this module is up to date in that?  I also note that the Opensim.ini.example file
</I>&gt;<i>             contains
</I>&gt;<i>             a reference to <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/__flotsam/">http://code.google.com/p/__flotsam/</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/flotsam/">http://code.google.com/p/flotsam/</A>&gt; for details of how to
</I>&gt;<i>             install the service.. but that seems to be
</I>&gt;<i>             pointing at an out of date version?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             I think for the flotsam php end it is straightforward and I obtained the changed groups.sql and xmlrpc.php files
</I>&gt;<i>             needed.  But note that people are still pointed via the opensim.ini.example comments at the old version on
</I>&gt;<i>             <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/__flotsam/">http://code.google.com/p/__flotsam/</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/flotsam/">http://code.google.com/p/flotsam/</A>&gt; so that either needs updating to teh
</I>&gt;<i>             latest version, or the comment in
</I>&gt;<i>             opensim.ini.exmaple needs to be changed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             To avoid mistakes, I wonder if you can clarify where to go for the parts needed and at what revision/date of
</I>&gt;<i>             OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i>             0.7.5 dev master this was introduced, what to get and what to change for an existing service in terms of the
