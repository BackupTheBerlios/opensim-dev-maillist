<PRE>Everything Dahlia mentioned we fully agree with per our own testing
especially avatars sitting which was something Chris Hart made sure we did
at our recent 20 person event

5/ . 
 
Our issues are usually about scripts not working mid-event than the server
crashing. Isolating heavy traffic sims to small groups and in particular for
us into Hyper-V virtual machines has proven to be a serious uptime boost.
Hurumph Dahlia!

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Auditorium for 500
 
I did some testing a couple months ago and found that sitting avatars
present much less load than avatars that are standing, walking, or flying.
Also there are other things going on that can compete for CPU resources,
such as scripts and updates for excessive prims. If you have few scripts
running and fewer prims/unique textures to download for each client who
attaches to the region, and if avatars are seated and requiring less
processing from the physics engine, then it stands to reason there will be
more CPU resources available to process chat and viewer updates from the
stage performance. This behavior is consistent with tests I've run.
 
On the subject of neighboring regions, OpenSim does little processing to
test whether agents on neighboring sims should be receiving update events
and this may cause excessive update traffic if there are several neighboring
regions hosting avatars, even if they aren't watching the events of
interest. Keeping your high traffic regions isolated to as small as possible
of a cluster size may help reduce the effects of this potential performance
drain.

 Thanks, Kyle. Your answer was very important to me. I am one of the few
guys in Brazil trying the use of OpenSim and have
received, some days ago, a consult from an important brazilian university
asking me about the possibility of the creation of a 3D &quot;virtual campus&quot;
having many resourses, included the auditorium for 500. My answer was: &quot;We
need to wait a little more to know if this is possible. My first impression
is that it is not an easy task to do it.&quot;.
 I am not an OpenSim expert like you but your answers confirm  that didn't
say anything very wrong.
