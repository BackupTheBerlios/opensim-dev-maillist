</I>I have the same reservations as you on the particular case of 
ChildAgentUpdate. However, assuming the HTTP server is up to the task, 
sending over HTTP is an improvement over sending over Remoting, I think. 
Both are TCP-based, and Remoting has the additional overhead of using 
reflection for serialization/deserialization, which is not the case for 
the HTTP calls.
But we'll find out if this is an overhead or not when this is deployed.

Right now, I'm following Melanie's advice and implement this as region 
modules. Like this:

OpenSim/Region/Environment/Modules/Local
OpenSim/Region/Environment/Modules/REST

Then in OpenSim.ini we'll have

[Communications]

;InterregionComms = &quot;LocalComms&quot;
;InterregionComms = &quot;RESTComms&quot;

(RESTComms is implemented using LocalComms too)

This will help making the transition incremental without disturbing what 
already exists, and slowly making the existing Comms code dead.

I don't think this architecture is exactly right, for a number of 
reasons. Communications pertains to Regions, yes, but not to 
Region/Environment. And communications may be empty but should never be 
null, so the region module concept is not the best; it will be better to 
have interfaces and replaceable DLLs. Essentially, I think the current 
design OpenSim.Region.Communications.* is the right one, but needs some 
improvements. Probably we should have something like this:

OpenSim/Region/Communications/Interregion/Local
OpenSim/Region/Communications/Interregion/REST
OpenSim/Region/Communications/Interregion/&lt;others&gt;
OpenSim/Region/Communications/UserService/Local
OpenSim/Region/Communications/UserService/REST
...

And then

[Communications]

;InterregionComms = 
&quot;OpenSim.Region.Communications.Interregion.LocalComms.dll&quot;
;InterregionComms = 
&quot;OpenSim.Region.Communications.Interregion.RESTComms.dll&quot;
;UserServiceComms = 
&quot;OpenSim.Region.Communications.UserService.LocalComms.dll&quot;
...

But for now, I'm going with region modules, just to make it work without 
interfering with the existing Comms, and to study the best manner of 
componentizing this whole thing.
