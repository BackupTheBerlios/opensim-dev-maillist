I'm not sure I would call that a bug so much as a missing dependency (which later got folded into mono 2.0 proper).

That's true.  However, I don't think that our current issues have anything much to do with Mono - we were quite happily 
carrying on with various versions of Mono including 1.9.1 and 2.0.1 before the latest troubles struck.
