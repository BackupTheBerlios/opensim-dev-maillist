As I said I'm seeing such a system a lot like IRC's for instance. On there you can join any server and almost any channel, and talk without having to register your nickname for as much as you want. Some advantages like constant OP status, joining 'registered users only' channels and other things are only offered once you register your nickname to that IRC server however. Or like forums which allow guests to read, post and make new topics, but only registered users can set theirselves an avatar, signature, PM other users, attach files to posts, etc. Something like that is what I'd imagine for Opensim as well in some ways... guests can come in but may not be allowed to build and script on some grids, disallowed to enter 'registered users only' regions, not have persistent avatar data and other limits.

ok, like a &quot;visit before sign-in&quot; thing ?

As far as I know, HyperGrid is about allowing an avatar to teleport into a linked grid only if they come from another grid where they have to have logged in as registered users first. A guest system wouldn't be about traveling from one grid to another (unless guests will later on be allowed to teleport between grids too which is a separate topic), but about anonymous people being able to log into a grid with a random name if they aren't registered... at least the way I imagine it.

Mircea, 

I don't get the point of that. This behaviour is already implemented with HyperGrid.

My own idea was not having guests as 'ghosts' or as invisible avatars unseen by others... I believe that would be against the purpose. My vision was that a guest could log in like any registered user with any random first name and the last name &quot;guest&quot;, and be wearing the default ruth avatar (girl with gray shirt and red pants) just like what a registered user is wearing the first time they go in-world before they get theirselves a custom avatar. Guests should also have all the library inventory of opensim as well, just not a persistent inventory of their own as that wouldn't be possible.



Oh and now that that's been brought up and I think about it, maybe guests could even have their own special guest avatars rather the default opensim ruth, so they could for example be wearing a shirt saying &quot;guest&quot; and look accordingly (eg: dressed up like someone going in a visit to somebody else or someone going in vacation).
