John,
 
&gt;<i> * The distributed asset server project (<A HREF="http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/assetserver/">http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/assetserver/</A>) has turned into the distributed grid services project. The asset server is almost at the same functionality as OpenSim.Grid.AssetServer.exe
</I> 
Excellent work, really cool that you're working on this!
 
&gt;<i> (it cannot create the MySQL database from scratch, but everything else seems to be in order), 
</I> 
I would argue that this is probably another reason to try to expand on the existing backend infrastructure - try to better what's already in the data layer so we don't end up with yet another set of DB services.
 
&gt;<i> inventory functionality has been merged into the asset server,
</I> 
That sounds a bit worrisome to me; not knowing the specifics, I'd like to hear a bit more about why?
 
&gt;<i>  and a user server project has been started to provide distributed authentication for the other services.
</I>Excellent.
&gt;<i> * Inventory support only has a file-system backend currently, a MySQL database backend that is compatible with the existing OpenSim.Grid.InventoryServer.exe backend is on the short term roadmap.
</I>Again, work towards integrating with what's already there - meet in the code, not in the db?
 &gt; * Login with the new user server is functional. There are still a lot of XML-RPC calls to implement, which will happen right after the distributed authentication is tested.
Cool++ - I guess same things goes for the user server as for the asset servers - build on what's there? A lot of peple have come to use the console to administrate their services, the db interfaces should ideally be the same, and the legacy protocols.
&gt;<i> * LDAP login is working. Since the LL viewer cannot easily support direct LDAP logins (it MD5 hashes the password before sending it), a simple web interface was added at /ldap that, upon login, will create a new avatar with your LDAP first name, last name, and hash of your current password. This could be merged into a larger account creation interface.
</I>I love it. Have you started thinkking about an authentication plug-in architecture for these schemes?
/Stefan
