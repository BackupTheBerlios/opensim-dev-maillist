<PRE>I'd have to put a big -1 on using XMPP for group chat. While XMPP is 
fantastic for user-to-user chat, and for small groups, it just does not 
scale to thousands of users in a single room. Let me give you my take.

I highly support using XMPP for IM. Each grid could have a single XMPP 
server to provide user-to-user and user-to-group-of-friends messaging - 
multi-person chat never gets larger than a few dozen at max, XMPP could 
handle this. It also, if worked properly, could allow for very easy 
out-of-world IM support - by providing the appropriate wrappers, and 
feeding credentials to the XMPP server, any XMPP-compatible client could 
load friends' list and provide chat. Links between XMPP servers also 
allow for hypergrid IMs.

For groups, though, I think IRC is definitely the way to go. Granted, we 
would need to wrap this in OpenSim code to allow for &quot;room&quot;/group 
authorization, notification, roles, etc - however, IRC is reliable and 
demonstrated to work for groups of thousands. Again, each grid runs an 
IRC server, and inter-server links allow for hypergrid group chats. 
Perhaps (this is a big perhaps, I've never dug into the details) OpenSim 
could provide some sort of ident server to assist authentication.
