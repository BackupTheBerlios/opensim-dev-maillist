</I>&gt;<i> Recently there has been much discussion in OpenSim, other Open Source
</I>&gt;<i> communities, and within realXtend itself. As a result of changes
</I>&gt;<i> within realXtend, there is some new direction and focus. I would like
</I>&gt;<i> to clear up any misconceptions and help set the stage for future
</I>&gt;<i> cooperation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The biggest change is that reX has asked added a technical architect,
</I>&gt;<i> Ryan McDougall, to help shore up its long range planning, and improve
</I>&gt;<i> community relations. The result has been an ongoing process of
</I>&gt;<i> planning for 2009 that pre-prioritized community involvement, and a
</I>&gt;<i> commitment to strategic goals, including a from-scratch BSD-derived
</I>&gt;<i> viewer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This means that our interactions with you will now be different. It
</I>&gt;<i> will be open and clear and everything you expect from a member of the
</I>&gt;<i> community in good standing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me also explain a bit more about realXtend past history and future
</I>&gt;<i> strategy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When RealXtend first began, it was with an idea about merging what was
</I>&gt;<i> real and what was virtual, in order to create tools and experiences
</I>&gt;<i> that affected peoples lives positively. Open Source was a core
</I>&gt;<i> principle in the project, because RealXtend was intended to become a
</I>&gt;<i> defacto standard for the coming revolution in how we interact with
</I>&gt;<i> world -- both real and electronic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many technology-bases were evaluated, and it was felt that a
</I>&gt;<i> combination of OpenSim and the Second Life(tm) viewer were the best in
</I>&gt;<i> class. Because there was much to learn and discover, the first couple
</I>&gt;<i> prototypes were made away from the respective communities. When
</I>&gt;<i> RealXtend decided on continuing evaluation of OpenSim and Second Life,
</I>&gt;<i> attempts were made to join both communities. Some of those attempts
</I>&gt;<i> were awkward or rebuffed, and without the experience of how to be a
</I>&gt;<i> member of an open community in good standing, it was decided it would
</I>&gt;<i> be more efficient to continue prototyping separately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now RealXtend finds itself at a cross-roads. Our prototypes have been
</I>&gt;<i> wildly successful in many ways -- except the ways that matter to
</I>&gt;<i> paying end-users. We find that it is becoming more and more difficult
</I>&gt;<i> as time goes on to maintain forked software and keep pace with
</I>&gt;<i> duplicated efforts in OpenSim. To remedy this fork, we have engaged
</I>&gt;<i> Deepthink to modify OpenSim to accept a port of RealXtend, and to make
</I>&gt;<i> most of the port itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The client side of the equation, however, remains more problematic.
</I>&gt;<i> While it is Open Source in name, it is not in practise, and our
</I>&gt;<i> changes will never make it back into the upstream repository. In order
</I>&gt;<i> to disengage ourselves from the wake of the private entity who
</I>&gt;<i> controls the repository, and make the sort of important, innovative
</I>&gt;<i> changes that we think are necessary, we have concluded that we must
</I>&gt;<i> have a truly open sourced client viewer that we have some ability to
</I>&gt;<i> participate in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We do not make this decision lightly, knowing how much work and money
</I>&gt;<i> that doing so represents. We take on this challenge because we know
</I>&gt;<i> someone must, and with the hope that with the help of many community
</I>&gt;<i> and corporate partners, we can together, make this a reality, and open
</I>&gt;<i> a new chapter in our industry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We will begin this new process in January and continuing until
</I>&gt;<i> February of 2009, with a feasibility study. That process will conclude
</I>&gt;<i> with a proposed road-map as a result, what will be able to take us
</I>&gt;<i> through 2009 and beyond. The process will begin internally with
</I>&gt;<i> RealXtend, in order to solidify a unifying core set of principles, but
</I>&gt;<i> very soon move outward to include a call for proposals and comments
</I>&gt;<i> from all of you. With a clear road-map and a successful consultation
</I>&gt;<i> process, we are confident that we will birth an cross platform Open
</I>&gt;<i> Source community that will be at the forefront of the 3D Virtual World
</I>&gt;<i> revolution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We invite you to give your feedback by visiting the RealXtend website,
</I>&gt;<i> trying out our software out, signing up for our mailing lists, or
</I>&gt;<i> joining us on IRC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sincerely,
</I>&gt;<i> Ryan McDougall
