Honestly, I think delete would be a good addition regardless, as it will
be needed if we want to be able to support reapers inside of OpenSim
(vs. having them externalized only).

Is the delete option workable for you?  It seems architecturally cleaner
to me.  You'd also want to delete from the asset cache at the same time,
to keep that from growing out of control.
