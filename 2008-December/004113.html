<PRE>I think that like a lot of people, I have only just realised that this is making the user server a OpenID provider rather than a consumer, and then the inventory/asset server will be the consumer. This is a approach that seems interesting but one that I haven't had time to do much thinking of yet so will wait a bit before commenting on it further. 

But I do agree with what Sean said, about us considering plugins for the UGAIM servers, is a good idea. From looking at the patch and doing a little bit of thinking on how a simple plugin architecture could work, I don't think it would take much to make this a plugin (once we had the plugin support in place). 

I think as more features get added, people are going to want to be able to decide what features their grids support. Like I made some commits to the inventory server the other week which raised a bit of debate about if they should be there or not. And I think there was good points on both sides of the debate. But as there was no alternative, I had to make those changes to the inventory server. If there had of been a plugin system, then I could have made a simple plugin.

posted on the distributed asset forge project soon. we're working to
validate the concepts in the forge project &amp; then start carving the
changes up into smaller chunks for incremental patching once we've
convinced ourselves that this is useful. the openid parts are pretty
fundamental to making any of these external services work so it seemed
like a good starting point.
