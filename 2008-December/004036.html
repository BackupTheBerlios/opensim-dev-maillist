<PRE>Even when compared to mature, production products we offer to host usually
users select OpenSim over all others.  You just have to properly set
expectations and then guide new users through the many limits. I personally
do feel OpenSim will exceed 100 avatars as the development team is amazingly
talented and dedicated. But I am only going by our almost full year of
testing and over a dozen grid owners we service.
 
Keep us posted Americo!

Americo,

No your testing is spot on, if not exceeding what we normally see OpenSim
Capable of being able to do, OpenSIM will likely never be capable of hosting
500 visitors in 1 simulator, Secondlifes Limit is somewhere around 100 and
even with 100 it runs extremly bad.  OpenSims Maximum acceptible user load
on even the most beefy hardware is somewhere between 20-30 visitors on a
good day, generally 10 visitors or even less will bring a sim crashing to
its knees within a matter of hours.  and even a Sim sitting idle generally
at this point doesnt last more than about 24 hours before becoming
completely unstable for use.  You need to remember this project is alpha
level, and very very very buggy software at this stage.  But that said, 500
avatars in one simulator is a lofty goal that probably can not be achieved
with OpenSIM, unfortunatly the programming language we have chosen to
program opensim in will probably prevent us from ever even being able to
have 100 avatars in 1 simulator, let alone 500.  Hope this helps, just be
aware that OpenSIM is just slightly more than 50% complete in its source
code.  There is still a very long road ahead before we get anywhere near the
end, or even begin beta testing with this software, IT IS NOT A PRODUCTION
ENVIRONMENT!  Good luck with your testing.

Thanks, Kyle.
 
I did some tests, having a &quot;basic&quot; (?) PC (DELL Latitude D 600 w/Centrino 2
GHz  512 Mb), OpenSim StandAlone, 1 region, Windows and &quot;my number&quot; is: NO
MORE THAN 20 visitors/avatares to have a good performance.
 
Is it a reasonable number or am I doing something wrong?
 
Thanks,
 
Americo
