The problem with stable branches... is they aren't.  If you add code to
a branch, you have the potential to break it, especially on a source
base as complex as OpenSim.

Personally, I'm going to stay focused on trunk, that's where my time and
interest lies.  A better approach to stability than stable branches is
to help create unit tests for trunk.  This helps contain behavior, and
drives towards code correctness for parts of the tree.  Over time,
that's the only way to have a truly stable tree.  It has prevented
dozens of bugs from going into the tree already.  I'd encourage people
spend time on enhancing automated testing instead of doing point in time
stable branches.
