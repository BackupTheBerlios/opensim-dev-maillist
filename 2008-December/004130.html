<PRE>Be careful here however,

Because if the hashing algorithm you choose ever gets 'broken' where it's possible to calculate a binary against a desired result, then people can potentially overwrite existing assets, etc.  A long hash tends to act as a good barrier against this. (256bit+ is ideal.)

Adam

First step would probably be to implement the sha-based binary store that you bring up and that we've discussed earlier, so that the immutables at least share the same binary data row. Right now, I believe we're seing massive duplication when people export/import content between worlds. Storing the binaries separately by sha key would probably be an low hanging fruit.

I would say that it's probably very much up to the service (aka 'the grid') how assets should be managed. On an grid that employs a consumer/producer division (like a fantasy game) you could probably reap dead assets quite aggressively. In a SL business model, it becomes harder, as they have to ensure consistent user experience in a heterogenous environment.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Melanie's recent thread[1] on updating assets prompted me to put in
</I>&gt;<i> writing some thoughts on this topic I've been having.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm curious whether it may be beneficial to make assets mutable. AFAIK
</I>&gt;<i> assets are currently immutable because of a LL decisions early on to
</I>&gt;<i> re-use one asset instance for very popular items sold no-modify. This
</I>&gt;<i> makes sense for them because they can:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * clean up unused assets since they own the entire infrastructure
</I>&gt;<i> (regions &amp; DBs)
</I>&gt;<i> * save on space because they anticipate more identical copies rather
</I>&gt;<i> than slightly modified copies
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps taking the opposite approach in OpenSim would be a better fit?
</I>&gt;<i> I mean, copying assets when they are transferred between owners, and
</I>&gt;<i> modifying them if they are modified in-world. I can see a few reasons
</I>&gt;<i> this might be beneficial:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * OpenSim's databases are distributed so cleaning them (reaping dead
</I>&gt;<i> assets) is more difficult
</I>&gt;<i> * with the advent of distributed asset servers and the long-term
</I>&gt;<i> vision of a wide open 3D Internet (like HyperGrid), when an item is
</I>&gt;<i> transferred in-world its assets should probably be stored in that
</I>&gt;<i> avatar's own inventory DB *anyway*
</I>&gt;<i> * disk is cheap, and I wonder which is more wasteful -- multiple
</I>&gt;<i> copies of an asset, each differing slightly due to minor edits over
</I>&gt;<i> time, or multiple copies of identical assets because they correspond
</I>&gt;<i> to different objects in-world
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see this as a cleaner approach to assets for the future. Sure,
</I>&gt;<i> storing duplicate identical assets in a DB can be wasteful, but this
</I>&gt;<i> could be alleviated with hashes of the asset or whatnot (I believe
</I>&gt;<i> this was brought up on this list before).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize this change would mean deep, possibly breaking, changes
</I>&gt;<i> throughout the source code, would take a long time to hash out, etc. I
</I>&gt;<i> thought I'd throw it out there anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your thoughts -- or perhaps clarifications on why this absolutely
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be done -- appreciated :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Mike
