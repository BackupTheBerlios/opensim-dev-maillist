<PRE>
Cristina,
 
&gt;<i> Apologies in advance for bringing up everyone's favorite hate topic, 
</I> 
Thank you for doing so.
 
&gt;<i> I'm &gt; just wondering if there is something here that I'm completely missing, &gt; or if this is really this bad:
</I>You're not, it is - the EQ was and still is, i guess, a panicked hack introduced just to maintain the least slice of viewer compatibility.
 
You're right - we hate it, and fear to thread near it.
&gt;<i> 1) It's implemented as an optional region module (!!!), configurable in &gt; OpenSim.ini (!!!). That explains why, for example, I could not reproduce &gt; crashes that other people have reported with older viewers. It turns out &gt; that those people are not just using older viewers; they are using &gt; OpenSim servers configured with EventQueue=false. A complete &gt; miscommunication.
</I>Yes, at one point in history, we didn't relly know much about the EQ or what role it would play - and separating this beast that didn't do much out into a module made sense then. Now, we know better - it should be part of the Linden specific Client Stack.
&gt;<i> 2) It's implemented as an optional region module -- the sequel. It is &gt; being considered a [optional] part of the Region Environment, something &gt; a region may or may not do. I'm afraid, this is the incorrect model. 
</I> 
In deed.
 
&gt;<i>The &gt; server side doesn't have any choice on this, if it wants to interact &gt; with the current version of the LL viewer. The EQ should be hand-in-hand &gt; with LLClientView. 
</I> 
So true. I love you for saying so.
 
&gt;<i> After all, it's the new channel of communications &gt; between a server and the LL viewer.
</I> 
Last I heard, LL have been very flaky on what to use EQ for, and what not to - has that changed? Is there a clear map over what is EQ-mandatory vs UDP-mandatory today?
 
&gt;<i> Things that used to go over UDP are &gt; now sent via the EQ, period, no choice.
</I> 
Historically, packets seem to have been transferred from UDP to EQ on a per-packet, day of week and influenced by sunspot activity base.
 
&gt;<i> If we &gt; want to support viewers with older communication stacks,
</I> 
Do we?
 
&gt;<i> then let's make &gt; that explicit in OpenSim and subclass LLClientView for the N previous &gt; versions of the LL viewer's communications stack. Region Environment, &gt; and the whole of the OpenSim framework, should be insulated from that &gt; mess, that's what the IClientAPI is there for.
</I> 
With that I do agree.
 
&gt;<i> No OpenSim.ini &gt; configuration variables, other than the already existing one:&gt; clientstack_plugin=&quot;OpenSim.Region.ClientStack.LindenUDP.dll&quot;
</I>+1
&gt;<i> What will happen when Rex comes along? ... what version of the LL viewer &gt; is that based on? ...
</I>The about in 0.4 says it is based on KirstenLee 1.15.
&gt;<i> Sorry for venting! 
</I> 
Perfectly understandably. The rest of us vented half a year ago or so.
 
&gt;<i> I'm just sending this out to find the answer to these &gt; three questions:&gt; &gt; a) Am I missing something?
</I>Nope, you're probably perfectly right.
&gt;<i> b) Are there any objections to placing EQ under &gt; OpenSim.Region.ClientStack.LindenUDP? (besides that name now being &gt; somewhat incorrect)
</I>I haven't seen nobody not +1'ing that. Change the name as well.
&gt;<i> c) Should OpenSim be backwards compatible with viewers forked off from &gt; older LL viewers *for the specific aspect of communications*? If so, &gt; what design pattern should be used?, subclassing or alternative code &gt; paths inside methods?
</I>That I leave up for discussion, but I believe that doing so can get very messy fast.
 
But, I think Adam et al has proposed a re-engineering of the client stack that will probably help - by letting each client implement several interfaces, instead of just one.
 
/Stefan
