<PRE>I really don't think standalone mode is a relic of the past, and don't think its finest hour is anywhere near yet. I think adaptions of standalone mode, with a Hypergrid type systems, are a big part of the future.

There are so many applications that a variant of standalone would fit much better than full grid mode.

But even if its not, it is certainly useful for testing and for new users. And performs much better than a grid for a few regions. Someone was asking about this in #dev the other day...Why when they switch from standalone to grid mode with the same number of regions, was the performance much worse.

There is also the issue that Justin mentioned last time we talked about this (last week in the other thread), of a user having to monitor the other processes and restarting them if one of them crashed. 

I really think we should be moving away from the grid system we have now. I think we could improve the Hypergrid concept of the grid/map and have a more peer to peer grid service.

But again I do think there is a lot that we can do to simplify the code paths, we have a lot of duplication that isn't needed and don't share code and interfaces between the UGAIM and the standalone services as much as we should. 

So my vote is still -1 to removing standalone mode.

multiple processes. Of course, you may have a different opinion.

I further believe that the overhead is negligible and caught up by 
the time saved within the application, for not having to call across 
delegates, interfaces and X layers of indirection.

An &quot;implicit grid mode&quot; can certainly be made VS friendly - just a 
matter of designing it that way.

And grid mode != SLClone. All the new directions (distributed asset 
system, OpenID, etc) revolve around grid mode.

Standalone is a relic from the early days that should have it's 
finest hour just about now. It's about as useless as a HTTP 1.0 
webserver in view of the things to come.
