I think you should clarify all of those assumptions with opensim core
and opensim's lawyers.

I think there are several developers, even in core, who have viewed LL
source at one point in their lives?

reX is working closely with US IP lawyers to prevent any legal issues
from affecting anyone who contributes to the code-base, including its
own employees, whom they are quite fond of. However the application of
law and the risk presented by potential suits is subject to individual
perception or tolerance. It is an issue of OpenSim policy, and not
really something I can speak on. You should consult your own lawyer,
and not just for copyright issues, but software patents in particular.

Luckly OpenSim has pro bono lawyers working for it, and I recommend
consulting with them thoroughly instead of relying on word-of-mouth or
back-seat legalizing.

If OpenSim decides a restrictive policy with regard to copyright risk
in conjunction with its lawyers, then it will be a shame to pass up on
that cooperation, but we will respect that policy.
