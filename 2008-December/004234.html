<PRE>Well, a journey begins with but a single step. Whatever we create will most likely be re-written and evolve as OpenSim has evolved over the last two years.

It just seems time that some semblance of groups appropriate for coalescing our OpenSim community would help us. Our definition and implementation of groups does not have to follow that which SecondLife followed *except* to the extent that we can use the official secondlife client to use our groups. Beyond that, we can create any infrastructure that may be appropriate.

The notion of goups along with the HyperGrid seems quite compelling to me. As I look at how our evolution is going, I see that a looser connection then grid-centric may be appropriate. Or perhaps we have groups within grids and also some sort of HyperGrid group notion. Either or both seems like a reasonable evolution.

Charles

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Groups and using our sims more

Dahlia makes some interesting points, as does Nebadon - I think that their concerns tend to suggest that 'groups' as a pure associative functionality should be abstracted away from some of the other functionality we are used to associating with groups, e.g., group instant messaging.

Cheers,
James

I think we need to be cautious here and consider the possible growth before just implementing the first thing that comes to mind. LL has certainly had difficulties with group chat as concurrency increases (although they are quite silent about why this happens). When we get to hundreds, thousands, perhaps even millions of concurrent online users then any deficiencies in the original design may come back to haunt us. Despite the opinions of some I do believe it is possible to have functional real time chat with millions of online users, there are networks that demonstrate capabilities similar to this already in existence, such as real time financial information networks. IRC with it's multiple star server node design may also provide some insight we can leverage. Whatever comes about, it seems multiple hosts will be required for more than just the few users that OSGrid sees at any one time. Some sort of P2P design may be workable if well thought out. I
 also suspect that presence tracking may be a difficult problem and should be considered upfront.

We are at the point where I believe some modest group implementation would help us move along significantly. Particularly, if our group implmentation had HyperGrid notions are were grid-agnostic.

We spend a lot of time on IRC these days and are missing the chance to use our sims more.

If we had even a modest implementation of groups, then it would be possible for folks to be testing building &amp; scripting and our IRC activities could, in some measure, move over to a &quot;HyperGrid Group Chat&quot;.

I would like to encourage us to think about this and see if there is a way to begin some modest implementation.
