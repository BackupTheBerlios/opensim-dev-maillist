Thank you very much for your input.

We of course have not made such a rudimentary error as to not notice
that there are in fact other viewers. Please rest assured that our
decisions are the result of serious and long-term planning and
discussion, and not foolishly made.

We respect each of the developers involved in the respective viewers,
and think very highly of their work. We believe that it is a statement
on the health of the community that there exist so many options. Time
will tell which of the available options will gain the most momentum,
but in the mean time, the compatibility of licenses ensures that there
will be much sharing of algorithms and code and good-will.

Detailed descriptions of our planning process, something ongoing for
several months now, and its results, is available for interested
parties upon request on another medium.

However, let me give you some basic reasons why we were unable to join
an existing effort:

== OpenViewer
Unable to join due to zero tolerance policy towards LL source code
exposure. This eliminates all of our viewer programmers.
<A HREF="http://openviewer.org/wiki/ContributionsPolicy">http://openviewer.org/wiki/ContributionsPolicy</A>

Please rest assured that we have and continue to have ongoing
consultations with US IP lawyers regarding specific means of
protecting reX and its contributors from spurious legal claims,
however we must disagree with the strictness of the OpenViewer policy.

== Xenki
Windows only. This invalidates our re-commitment to cross platform.

== IdealistViewer
One of our core requirements was that reX be usable for hard,
professional, real-time 3D video games, which our partner company,
Ludocraft, intends to use along side their Unreal-based games.

For this reason it was felt that a large part of the code must be
written in C++ to retain an acceptable performance edge. Higher level
languages should be limited to one, and Python was chosen over C#.
This makes it hard to join IdealistViewer if we don't even share a
common language.

If you have other questions please let us know.

Cheers,

</PRE>
