<PRE>Having groups is huge James.  We thank you for trying to get this
implemented.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Groups and using our sims more
 
It comes to light that the confusion I had wrt to the module on GForge is
the result of Melanie telling me she has groups mostly finished, yet I find
that the module on GForge is merely a module skeleton with zero
functionality.

As it turns out, Melanie did not post the module on GForge, Fly-Man did -
and Melanie is unwilling to open her groups code to the rest of the project.

I submit that we need to stop waiting on this code to appear, and start work
(or continue work, as the case may be), to implement groups ourselves.

Fly-Man is doing some productive work completing user profiles, and that is
perhaps the first place where the client touches groups, and in the least
substantial way; I think we could begin to examine the codepaths he is
presently working with, and in other places I have mentioned earlier in this
thread, and begin to put something together that we can at least patch and
troubleshoot.

Your thoughts?

Cheers,
James

and definitely +1 on using something existing for it, i think that
aligns with the Realxtend goals too.

XMPP may well be it, i think i +1 'd it also previous time when some
(student project?) asked on this list whether they should do it :)

while looking at SIP too, there's reason to believe that XMPP may be the
relevant one. and of course making it modular gives the freedom to run
anything.

especially when described as:

&gt;<i>     I second this. From what I understand, XMPP is optimized to deliver
</I>&gt;<i>     small snippets of information, any information, to many concurrent
</I>&gt;<i>     users effectively.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>that is sort of what was / is the interesting part of SIP too, and if
XMPP works simpler (and even better?) for it, sounds great. i suppose
around XMPP there are nowadays the similar mechanisms for
from/to-behind-NAT traversal etc. that there are for SIP (i mean the
srtp relay somethings).

&gt;<i>     XMPP's got that solved with its decentralized servers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>haven't looked at XMPP in a long time in detail, but was following the
early developments as was interested in irc etc. at the time, and trust
that the wisdom has carried over from ppl who started having probs with
irc when user levels reached &gt;100'000 in a network or so, and from
anyone else doing that work. haven't seen much jabber addresses of
people though, but i guess that's another story, like said haven't
followed now.

one thing i've found peculiar regarding xmpp/sip and friends is the
presence information, 'cause virtual worlds seem to be a lot about that
(the difference to the current web is user presence, basically). the
specs may even talk of avatars etc. so interesting to see how the design
will eventually form..
