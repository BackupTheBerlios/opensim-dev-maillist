<PRE>I made a promise to Jani and others nearly a year ago.

That promise was &quot;If you guys start getting some of your logic into OpenSim to support your mesh ideas, then I will go out of my way to get a team to test the Rex viewer on OpenSim regions and grids&quot;.

I think we are about at that stage and the time has come to see if we can test the Rex viewer and get it going with OpenSim.

The rest of it will continue to happen as we all discuss the logic ideas from Rex related to OpenSim and work together to continue to build out our part of the Metaverse.

Biased +1.
 
I do think the last month has been a good positive step to
getting the communities working better with each other, Rex has started
contributing to the OpenSim core project, we just need to keep it step by step &#8211;
right now the modules can do everything Rex wants, although at some point in
the future we might want to start talking joint projects for implementing
features we both want, and do so in a way that we both benefit.
 
Regards,
 
Adam

+1 , lets keep this from becoming a big argument and instead
focus on where the two projects can work together.

On the subject of support for the Rex viewer in opensim:

I think the goal of opensim has always been to support lots of different
viewers, and Rex happen to have a viewer, which is also the only viable
&quot;user ready&quot; viewer, that I know of, that supports meshes. So it
makes sense that opensim supports it if possible, and Adam is working towards
that with his modules.

Maybe in the future we will also have a different mesh system in opensim. But
just by us supporting the Rex system now, doesn't stop there being other ones,
or it being improved on.

And on the subject components like the Rex avatar server:

It would be good if Rex could provide more information about their avatar
server/system. As here, I share the same opinion that I believe Melanie was
meaning, that really from a opensim side, the Rex avatar system has been too
closed in its design and development. With no or little input from the wider
community. 

Everything that goes into opensim has to be open to all the developers,
including having the design of the compontents openly disccused from the
initial stages. 

But understandably Rex have their own methods and have to commit their
resources where and how they think they best meet their needs. Which results in
them having a slightly different opensource approach to that of opensim. 

Its just that I don't think its very likely that opensim will accept, into the
opensim core, components like the Avatar server, without the opensim developers
having more involvement in the design and development of such a important
component. 

Having said that I do think both sides (rex and opensim) are learning how to
work together much better, so maybe in the future we could work together on a
shared avatar system. 

But whatever the differences, both projects share a lot in common and have afaik
very similar goals. So we should all do as much as we can to help each other
towards our shared aims.

Hang on, hang
on. Lets get back to where we can move forward step by step and have a little
fun in the process.

1. There is a Rex Viewer. Lets get some momentum on the OpenSim side with one
or more folks testing it on one or more OpenSim grids and report on the
#opensim IRC channel and this e-mail what works and what doesnt work in such a
way that the Rex folks can move forward in a logical manner.

2. There is a Rex server. Some of it may be appropriate to bring into OpenSim
as modules or patches. Lets discuss as &quot;peers&quot; the technical issues,
merits and implementations that the Rex server brings to OpenSim.

3.  Lets get a similar testing and integration effort underway on one or
more grids in order to allow those parts of the Rex work which are appropriate
for OpenSim to get closer to svn. 

I understand the passions involved. We all have passions, and I am no exception.
But, working out the technical details and letting go of past issues is the
best way for us to move forward.
