The OpenID patch is missing a few critical things
1. url and license for how that OpenID.dll was built.  If it isn't a
direct binary from another url, it should go into the opensim-libs.  It
would suck to have no way to update it if there was an issue.
2. It being off by default, and only enabled via a config.

I also think that something as big (conceptually) as openid integration
should be based on a discussion here first, instead of a patch over the
weekend.

I also think that before we start adding new urls that only some people
will use on grid servers that we look at something like region modules
for the grid servers.  That would make adding openid or other things
much easier to implement and turn off for people that aren't using them.
