Ahem.
 
Something I've been asking since Finland, a year ago, is why we have the notion of a 'appearance service' as our base case at all, local storage or not.
 
It would seem, that the only thing the avatar appearance rendering component really need is a url ('All you need is url', the Beatles) that points to something serving an appearance asset of the right family of forms. This in turn can refer to other resources by url.
 
Ie, that url could be a static html page, or something generated by a cms, or from a database, or to a file on your hard disk that you authored with some cool tool.
I just wanted to make sure that the _base_case_ is not an interactive authentication and negotiation process - that would cut off a magnitude of use cases where that just doesn't make sense.
 
Again, think of the web (1.0 and 2.0) - we're only negotiating for content when it makes sense, otherwise, free and simple access is key.

Avatar-on-a-keyring might even be the &gt; solution for Internet Cafes there.&gt; &gt; Opensim should be able to accommodate all these viewpoints, which is &gt; why decoupling mesh support from avatar login service support is &gt; very important to me.&gt; &gt; Melanie&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
