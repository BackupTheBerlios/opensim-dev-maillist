<PRE>I am not JHurliman, but I have actually given this topic considerable
thought. As I see things, there probably is no way to incorporate OpenID
directly into the existing client.

I dont let this concern me overmuch - I think constraining ourselves to
existing client functionality is a certain way to allow our friends at
Linden Labs to remain the defacto industry leaders of this technology.

Now that that is out of the way, there are certain methodologies that I
could employ to put an OpenID capability to work today:

Scenario 1: Keep all accounts 'deactivated' by default (even when they are
valid, active accounts), activating them only at such time as the OpenID
authorization method I've embedded into the splash page is completed. Once
that embedded authorization procedure is completed, the account would be
enabled, and login would procede as normally occurs with the client.

Scenario 2: All login procedures as per usual; OpenID kept on file for for
positive identification on an as-needed basis where such things are
relevant: access to mature content, proof of ownership of assets, resolution
of complaints, etc.

Scenario 3: External authentication layers that might be built on top of
e.g., Hypergrid or OGP, which cant really be explored at present because we
have no support for authenticating via OpenID.

These are just three that occur to me off the top of my head. I think all
represent use cases that are desirable here and now. We simply lack the
tools to implement them at present. All that remains is that some
trailblazing group put the tools in the hands of users.

Will we blaze that trail? or will we read about who already has on the
Linden blog?

I say +100, get this patch in trunk. ASAP.


Cheers
James
