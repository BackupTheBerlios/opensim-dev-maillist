<PRE>This is a great concept Stefan and similar to what I talked about at an
event with some other OpenSim gurus.  I would love to be flying back from a
business conference on ReactionGrid in a suit and as I cross to say OSG
where a party awaits I change into my &#8220;OSG&#8221; party outfit/robot Superman
style.  This works because everything I would want to use at the party I
would in no way want revealed at the business meeting. Hurumph!

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] UGAIM++ (Re: rex auth &amp; avatar systems)
 
Over time,
 
the winning strategy is to allow for easy implementation of case-specific
architectures - as you yourself saw with being able to (realtively) easily
implement 'hypergrid' on OpenSim.
 
OpenSim will 'win' by being the thing that allows the winning architecture
to be built upon it, and not by pushing any specific set of architecture
design solutions (but this).
 
So, trying to do something 'better than the web' is a precarious stance, as
the web was proofed by use, and is, in its own right, the best solution.
 
That said, I do agree 100% with the 'home' and 'home grid' concept - we have
played with letting regions add and remove inventory items and permissions
depending on what region you're on - so yes, in your 'home' region, you
would have full access to all your items, and would be able to create a new
avatar appearance, but if you did it in another region (untrusted) any
profile, inventory and appearance updates would not get stored. Or vice
versa, if you landed in the medieval fantasy sim, you would get an inventory
node with region-specific themed items. We think this approach holds
promise.

Also, on 'putting it on apache' - that's _exactly_ what we've been trying to
do since the beginning of OpenSim. Or rather, enable people to do so,
reasonably easy. The http server architecture was, with the streamhandlers,
meant to be able to be portable to other production environments - it's
REALLY easy to do an asp.net ashx generic web handler that acts as a service
in-place drop-in by just forwarding the request/response streams to their
respective handlers, allowing you to keep the 'business logic' of the
protocol handlers whilst delegating the actual communications to another
layer. The UGAIM service exes were thought of as 'the reference
implementations'.
 
As always, there's the API, the protocols and the services as
_reference_implementations_.
