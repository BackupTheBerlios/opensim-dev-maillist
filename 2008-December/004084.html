Is the client supplying anything that allows us to mark the assets as 'temp', and the the final save as 'non-temp' at all?Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A> &gt; Date: Sun, 14 Dec 2008 18:59:58 +0000&gt; From: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">melanie at t-data.com</A>&gt; To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Always mutable assets in OpenSim -- does it make sense?&gt; &gt; There is no way that can be done in a way that wouldn't break &gt; zillions of other things. If we could save/push the object, we &gt; wouldn't need to mod assets in the first place. problem is that you &gt; can't cover the case of a crash any other way.&gt; &gt; Melanie&gt; &gt; &gt; Sean Dague wrote:&gt; &gt; Melanie wrote:&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the assets that we need to update are not assets that are sent to &gt; &gt;&gt; the client. There is no reasonable way to update texture, animation, &gt; &gt;&gt; or sound assets. Those are sent to the client and cached there. &gt; &gt;&gt; However, it is possible to update prim and script assets, since the &gt; &gt;&gt; client never sees them. On scripts, this makes little sense, unless &gt; &gt;&gt; the &quot;implicitly shared&quot; approach is dropped. But introducing script &gt; &gt;&gt; state in inventory will make immutable assets practical there again.&gt; &gt;&gt; The only asset that needs updating is a prim assets, and that only &gt; &gt;&gt; needs to be updated, and is only safe to update, when editing &gt; &gt;&gt; attachments.&gt; &gt;&gt; Solving the thread lifetime (not easy!) still doesn't solve the &gt; &gt;&gt; issue, which is a crash in the middle of editing. Massive amounts of &gt; &gt;&gt; work could be lost, so a means to save periodically is needed, and &gt; &gt;&gt; mutable prim assets are the only place where this can be sensibly done.&gt; &gt;&gt; From my end, this is _not_ a proposal to move to generally treating &gt; &gt;&gt; assets as mutable, merely a proposal to allow it in one special case &gt; &gt;&gt; which could not be solved in another reasonable way.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, if that's the case, and these thing are really different, and not&gt; &gt; sent on the wire, why not make them something different in the system.&gt; &gt; Call them &quot;states&quot; or something, and have their intermediate states&gt; &gt; saved elsewhere, and only push to the asset db once they are in some&gt; &gt; final (client retrievable) state.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Having spent a lot of time educating people on the fact that assets&gt; &gt; can't be changed, I think we're going to introduce all manner of&gt; &gt; confusion if that gets broken. Much better to make a new type of object&gt; &gt; instead of changing something so fundemental about assets the way they&gt; &gt; are today.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Sean&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; &gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; &gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; &gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
