<PRE>What database are you on? You must get to MSSQL or MYSQL for any real load
testing period. If you need help here let me know.  What connection are you
on? You would need a 1Mbps symmetrical pipe to do 10-20 though more would be
better if building and terraforming is occurring. The RAM you listed is
horribly light.  We recommend no more than 70% RAM use at idle for any grid
no more than 50% RAM use if you are to go over 20 avatars on one machine.
Our core machines use the 50% rule and attached machines use the 70%
roughly.
 
Also we noticed the number of threads drops by almost half when we allocate
2 Xeon cores using Hyper-V to a grid over 1. This does not seem to affect
the host machine but it did dramatically improve OpenSim performance. 
 
We think we can draw from this that OpenSim loves parallel processing.  I
also noticed that despite it seeming like OpenSim was not running out of RAM
the &#8220;core&#8221; server (Core 2 Duo 2GigRAM) was beginning to bog down. We went to
4Gig of RAM and immediately saw OpenSim take 2.5Gig RAM now (60 + sims grid)
. This means you need loads of excessive RAM when considering more than
10-20 users even if your  front panel indicators show plenty of RAM.
 
Also the Centrino is a problem. If you could get a P4 or even older Xeon the
L2 cache is a huge performance boost. Your machine is fine for lower numbers
but you certainly could at least add RAM and see if you can break the
barriers you are seeing. Keep us posted on testing as the machine you listed
is a perfect starter machine and with a little RAM could do far better than
you see now.
 
Good luck Americo!

Thanks, Kyle.
 
I did some tests, having a &quot;basic&quot; (?) PC (DELL Latitude D 600 w/Centrino 2
GHz  512 Mb), OpenSim StandAlone, 1 region, Windows and &quot;my number&quot; is: NO
MORE THAN 20 visitors/avatares to have a good performance.
 
Is it a reasonable number or am I doing something wrong?
 
Thanks,
 
Americo
