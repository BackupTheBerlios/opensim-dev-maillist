First step would probably be to implement the sha-based binary store that you bring up and that we've discussed earlier, so that the immutables at least share the same binary data row. Right now, I believe we're seing massive duplication when people export/import content between worlds. Storing the binaries separately by sha key would probably be an low hanging fruit.
I would say that it's probably very much up to the service (aka 'the grid') how assets should be managed. On an grid that employs a consumer/producer division (like a fantasy game) you could probably reap dead assets quite aggressively. In a SL business model, it becomes harder, as they have to ensure consistent user experience in a heterogenous environment.

AFAIK&gt; assets are currently immutable because of a LL decisions early on to&gt; re-use one asset instance for very popular items sold no-modify. This&gt; makes sense for them because they can:&gt; &gt; * clean up unused assets since they own the entire infrastructure&gt; (regions &amp; DBs)&gt; * save on space because they anticipate more identical copies rather&gt; than slightly modified copies&gt; &gt; Perhaps taking the opposite approach in OpenSim would be a better fit?&gt; I mean, copying assets when they are transferred between owners, and&gt; modifying them if they are modified in-world. I can see a few reasons&gt; this might be beneficial:&gt; &gt; * OpenSim's databases are distributed so cleaning them (reaping dead&gt; assets) is more difficult&gt; * with the advent of distributed asset servers and the long-term&gt; vision of a wide open 3D Internet (like HyperGrid), when an item is&gt; transferred in-world its assets should probably be stored in that&gt; avatar's own inventory DB *anyway*&gt; * disk is cheap, and I wonder which is more wasteful -- multiple&gt; copies of an asset, each differing slightly due to minor edits over&gt; time, or multiple copies of identical assets because they correspond&gt; to different objects in-world&gt; &gt; I see this as a cleaner approach to assets for the future. Sure,&gt; storing duplicate identical assets in a DB can be wasteful, but this&gt; could be alleviated with hashes of the asset or whatnot (I believe&gt; this was brought up on this list before).&gt; &gt; I realize this change would mean deep, possibly breaking, changes&gt; throughout the source code, would take a long time to hash out, etc. I&gt; thought I'd throw it out there anyway.&gt; &gt; Your thoughts -- or perhaps clarifications on why this absolutely&gt; cannot be done -- appreciated :)&gt; &gt; Thanks,&gt; Mike&gt; &gt; [1] <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/opensim-dev/2008-December/004025.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/opensim-dev/2008-December/004025.html</A>&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
