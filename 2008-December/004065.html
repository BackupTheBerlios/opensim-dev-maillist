So, if that's the case, and these thing are really different, and not
sent on the wire, why not make them something different in the system.
Call them &quot;states&quot; or something, and have their intermediate states
saved elsewhere, and only push to the asset db once they are in some
final (client retrievable) state.

Having spent a lot of time educating people on the fact that assets
can't be changed, I think we're going to introduce all manner of
confusion if that gets broken.  Much better to make a new type of object
 instead of changing something so fundemental about assets the way they
are today.
