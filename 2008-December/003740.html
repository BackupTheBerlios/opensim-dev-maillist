I have a nagging feeling that we have quite a few constructs like this
 
A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D 
 
where A locks on a mutex, then calls B that looks innocuous enough, but that in turn sometimes calls C that calls the long running/context switching D function.
Ususally, it's a bad idea to call foreign classes in a lock-block. Usually, it's quite easy to refactor blocks that do into blocks that don't.
 
And, I know that at least historically, I've seen constructs that lock in order to serialize calls, rather than to protect data.

May improve performance during login/logout &#8211; but &gt; &gt;&gt; ScenePresences (which I haven&#8217;t touched yet) is probably the real &gt; &gt;&gt; culprit there.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To be honest, I suspect the real issue on login/logout performance is the fact that mono does not yet implement thread &gt; &gt; prioritization - you can see it but properties such as Thread.Priority are merely stubs.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So when a login/logout comes along it's not currently possible to give existing clients or threads such as the scene &gt; &gt; update execution priority. So I'm thinking that the significant cpu spike on login/logout slows the whole system down.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I looked at login recently and I don't believe that the periods of lock holding are significant enough to be causing the &gt; &gt; delay.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No actual proper performance analysis was carried out so I could be wrong.&gt; &gt; Using serverstats, something I've noticed is that on Linux after you get&gt; a dozen people into your environment, system time of the process ends up&gt; matching user time of the process (about 7% of total CPU for both).&gt; This lines up with when the lag starts to get bad.&gt; &gt; High system time on linux means there is something the kernel is doing&gt; for you that you need to watch for. Typically this includes locking.&gt; &gt; So I tend to believe the locking is really the problem. Also, the china&gt; team got their 1000 avatars simulated on OpenSim by doing lots of lock&gt; removal. That work was over a year ago, but I suspect the approaches&gt; are still valid.&gt; &gt; I do think this is where our biggest choke point is right now. One&gt; question I've got is whether the synchronized datastructures on mono are&gt; more efficient than doing the locks yourself. On .NET that is known to&gt; be true, but I'm not sure on Mono. I integrated one such change in the&gt; packet outgoing queue 6 months ago, and got some confirmation that&gt; stability went up after that change.&gt; &gt; -Sean&gt; &gt; -- &gt; Sean Dague / Neas Bade&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">sdague at gmail.com</A>&gt; <A HREF="http://dague.net">http://dague.net</A>&gt; &gt;
