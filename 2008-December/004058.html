<PRE>There is something called HyperGrid that allow you  to jump from your native
sim to any other linked sim. Seriously, I doubt any grid will allows
anonymous login for safety reason.

&gt;<i>  I have been thinking about this feature for a while and thought it's time
</I>&gt;<i> I post it here to discuss it with the team. In the latest version of Opensim
</I>&gt;<i> there is an &quot;allow anonymous logins&quot; option in opensim.ini.example for
</I>&gt;<i> standalone mode, which allows avatars who haven't registered to that region
</I>&gt;<i> to login by choosing any random first name, last name and password. This has
</I>&gt;<i> always been helpful for me and an easy method of connecting to local sims,
</I>&gt;<i> and made it quick and simple to easily log in and be in-world even if you
</I>&gt;<i> didn't have an account set up. Watching this possibility and how easy that
</I>&gt;<i> makes things work has then gotten me thinking in depth about something: What
</I>&gt;<i> would it be like if on grids like OSGrid and others anyone could be allowed
</I>&gt;<i> to login anonymously as guests without having registered their avatar from
</I>&gt;<i> the grid's website? How much easier and better would it make it if anyone
</I>&gt;<i> could just open the SL client pointing to the grid's -loginuri and go in?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not trying to say that going on a page like osgrid.org and registering
</I>&gt;<i> there is too hard to do, but I think that anonymous logins in grids could
</I>&gt;<i> have a positive impact and severily open and change the metaverse. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, whenever you want to visit a forum or go onto an IRC server /
</I>&gt;<i> channel, you most often don't register before entering there to read or
</I>&gt;<i> talk, and yet it's very helpful that you are allowed to just go in anytime
</I>&gt;<i> from anywhere and stick around with some limits, allowed to register your
</I>&gt;<i> nickname / username when and if you wish to later on. Opensim works a lot
</I>&gt;<i> like a forum from certain points of view, and a region works like a thread
</I>&gt;<i> with its own topics in some ways. People often come in, configure
</I>&gt;<i> theirselves as they wish, see what's there, talk with other people... unless
</I>&gt;<i> they are builders and have their own sim as well. So just think about it...
</I>&gt;<i> all that made easy for all. For instance you quickly want to invite someone
</I>&gt;<i> to your sim on a grid, and if this would be allowed it would be as simple as
</I>&gt;<i> dropping that person the loginuri for the client and in a second he could
</I>&gt;<i> join you as a guest (given he couldn't register or figure out how to
</I>&gt;<i> register in that moment). And now that there are SL viewers which work off
</I>&gt;<i> web browsers as well, think what use this could be put to... an avatar could
</I>&gt;<i> just go to www.something.com, choose a nickname (firstname / lastname) and
</I>&gt;<i> be in-world!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course I'm talking about a non-default setting, this would only be a
</I>&gt;<i> feature which grid owners would enable if they wanted to, and unless someone
</I>&gt;<i> specifically wants this enabled grids would remain restricted to registered
</I>&gt;<i> users only. There are of course other questions this raises as well... for
</I>&gt;<i> instance, avatars loging in as guests would not have their inventory,
</I>&gt;<i> profile and all other settings stored between login sessions, as it would be
</I>&gt;<i> very complicated and pointless to persist stuff like inventory for someone
</I>&gt;<i> who only logs in once with a random auto-generated name and avatar UUID. Yet
</I>&gt;<i> they could walk around, talk, build as well, and I think this would bring
</I>&gt;<i> the community on Opensim closer and offer a lot of advantages if done
</I>&gt;<i> proberly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ways to differ guests from registered users should be placed in as well.
</I>&gt;<i> Best way would be forcing the Last Name to be &quot;Guest&quot;, so to login as
</I>&gt;<i> anonymous the user would need to use any first name they want, the last name
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;guest&quot; and no password. That would be the best way to know when someone did
</I>&gt;<i> not log in as a registered user or not. Also, individual regions should be
</I>&gt;<i> given the option to specify if they allow guests in or not, as long as the
</I>&gt;<i> grid itself does too. A grid could allow anonymous logins but a region may
</I>&gt;<i> specify if it doesn't want to allow that from opensim.ini.example, and a
</I>&gt;<i> guest trying to TP or border cross to such a region would be blocked with a
</I>&gt;<i> popup telling them they need to use an avatar registered to the grid to
</I>&gt;<i> enter. Grids and / or sims could also give what permissions they would wish
</I>&gt;<i> to guests as well, such as if guests should be allowed to build on that grid
</I>&gt;<i> / sim, script, upload files and all else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is an interesting point and would love to hear your opinions
</I>&gt;<i> as to wether or not this should be done one way or another. This couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> ruin anything or make anyone unhappy if they don't want to enable it, and I
</I>&gt;<i> for one see a bright future with allowing such a thing to work. To make
</I>&gt;<i> things even more clear I made a small personal list of pros and cons for
</I>&gt;<i> allowing anonymous logins on large grids. Here it is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pros:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Allowing anonymous logins on grids would make it easier for people to get
</I>&gt;<i> in and have at least a tour of things, thus increase user count and
</I>&gt;<i> popularity of Opensim and OS based grids. When many people hear they have to
</I>&gt;<i> register to look around OSGrid they often say &quot;forget it, I don't have time
</I>&gt;<i> to bother with this right now&quot;, but if people could easily visit as guests
</I>&gt;<i> many would likely get in and take a look more often. On OSGrid I believe
</I>&gt;<i> this could severily increase user count and popularity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Such a feature would allow easily using Opensim as something similar to a
</I>&gt;<i> forum or IRC system, as I had mentioned above. Just like on forums where
</I>&gt;<i> guests are allowed to post but cannot have an avatar or signature and upload
</I>&gt;<i> files until they register, Opensim could allow guests to login and chat,
</I>&gt;<i> build, while registering would offer an unique name for the user as well as
</I>&gt;<i> a persistent inventory and profile, probably more rights as well depending
</I>&gt;<i> on what the grid would allow guests to do. This could also make usage
</I>&gt;<i> between Opensim and other platforms like chat systems even more easier, and
</I>&gt;<i> encourage other applications on guest-based user systems to try to connect
</I>&gt;<i> with Opensim creatively.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Useful for testing and especially for running bots. For pCampBot you need
</I>&gt;<i> to register an avatar for every single bot you want to login, and don't
</I>&gt;<i> forget that on most grids you need a different email address for each avatar
</I>&gt;<i> you register as well. On OSGrid for instance I used up all my email
</I>&gt;<i> addresses to make two bot accounts and my own account. This would allow
</I>&gt;<i> running bots easily without having to register each first as well as making
</I>&gt;<i> other types of tests easier as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - One thing this would do would be to open new doors to griefers. Many
</I>&gt;<i> griefers could try to barge in and do what they want with scripts, attacks,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. There would be ways to prevent that of course... for instance access
</I>&gt;<i> from a certain IP address should remain be possible to restrict in the same
</I>&gt;<i> way rather that you attempt to login as a registered grid user or as a guest
</I>&gt;<i> from that machine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - As mentioned above, features like static inventory, profiles, groups,
</I>&gt;<i> friends list, and other things related to storing information in the grid
</I>&gt;<i> for an avatar would not be doable for guests, and all that would be
</I>&gt;<i> temporary for each login session in their case. Still they can run and fly,
</I>&gt;<i> talk and build, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So yeah, that's what I thought of so far. I hope this idea will be
</I>&gt;<i> considered and maybe OSGrid and other grids would be better and have a
</I>&gt;<i> bigger and more open community this way. What do you think? Would allowing
</I>&gt;<i> anonymous logins for grid mode and using them in a limited amount on large
</I>&gt;<i> grids be a good idea? Is it doable, are there any plans on that?
