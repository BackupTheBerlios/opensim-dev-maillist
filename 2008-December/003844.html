indeed. in a way i also feel that almost a year was lost in the lack of 
coordination. but i guess that just means we must really work well to 
get the possible benefits now.

yep like i mentioned in the previous post they are orthogonal and 
should be separate. was thinking of that earlier this week but didn't 
have time to bring up with the Rex people yet.

for my(*) need it is actually good to have extensive Ogre support, and 
not a weaker general mesh support. i mean things like particle effects, 
post processing, and things in the ogre material system.

(*) am kinda having a dual role here: we have our own company Playsign 
that makes games and other things where apply game design, and is 
interested in using opensim/realxtend, but am also now again (since a 
little less than a month now) working directly for Realxtend too. here 
am referring to Playsign needs, as there we have used Ogre for long and 
have materials, particle systems etc. ready that would like to use.

the Realxtend need in general i guess matches with the OpenSim thinking 
that nothing should be tied to a specific graphics engine, and meshes 
(and their basic texturing) indeed are standard enough that they can be 
supported in an engine independent way.

i just wish that there's some way that the support for advanced ogre 
specific features could be kept too, as an option for the time being at 
least .. well, currently that is ModRex.

&gt;<i> Hypergrid is indeed a good example, it was implemented to the proof

&gt;<i> I would hope and I am looking forward to a similar level of 
</I>&gt;<i> cooperation with Rex.
</I>
Fair enough.

One possible area for such review and possible refactor etc. might be 
also the rex scripting that also introduces some new ideas and where 
OpenSim some integration things could be reconsidered.

But the way now is to first get things working in ModRex as they are, 
and then get to these next steps.
