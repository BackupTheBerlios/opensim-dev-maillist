<PRE>There is no way that can be done in a way that wouldn't break 
zillions of other things. If we could save/push the object, we 
wouldn't need to mod assets in the first place. problem is that you 
can't cover the case of a crash any other way.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or sound assets. Those are sent to the client and cached there. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, it is possible to update prim and script assets, since the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client never sees them. On scripts, this makes little sense, unless 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the &quot;implicitly shared&quot; approach is dropped. But introducing script 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> state in inventory will make immutable assets practical there again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only asset that needs updating is a prim assets, and that only 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needs to be updated, and is only safe to update, when editing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attachments.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Solving the thread lifetime (not easy!) still doesn't solve the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue, which is a crash in the middle of editing. Massive amounts of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work could be lost, so a means to save periodically is needed, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mutable prim assets are the only place where this can be sensibly done.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  From my end, this is _not_ a proposal to move to generally treating 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assets as mutable, merely a proposal to allow it in one special case 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which could not be solved in another reasonable way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, if that's the case, and these thing are really different, and not
</I>&gt;<i> sent on the wire, why not make them something different in the system.
</I>&gt;<i> Call them &quot;states&quot; or something, and have their intermediate states
</I>&gt;<i> saved elsewhere, and only push to the asset db once they are in some
</I>&gt;<i> final (client retrievable) state.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having spent a lot of time educating people on the fact that assets
</I>&gt;<i> can't be changed, I think we're going to introduce all manner of
</I>&gt;<i> confusion if that gets broken.  Much better to make a new type of object
</I>&gt;<i>  instead of changing something so fundemental about assets the way they
</I>&gt;<i> are today.
