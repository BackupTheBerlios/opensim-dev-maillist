&gt;<i> I would think that you'd want anonymous users to show up in the region&gt; (i.e. not be invisible) so that people in the region know that someone&gt; is there.
</I> 
Yes and no, depending on application. I guess what I'm saying is that we could allow for those cases just by choosing another base case. OpenSim definitively should support not sending avatar updates to all connected clients. I guess that would make for some interesting test cases when it comes to performance as well.
 
&gt;<i> Call is psuedo anonymous, where you don't need credentials,&gt; and you can't interact with the environment beyond speaking, and you&gt; show up as a grey gob,
</I> 
Just don't send the av appearance... and you will. That should probably happen if you don't automatically create av appearance for non-authenticated agents.
 
&gt;<i> but others can still see that you are there.&gt; This wouldn't be too bad to implement in the existing system (though you&gt; might have to play around with permissions to create an anon class of&gt; users).
</I>Yup, it's those kinds of experiments I think we should start doing, to get a feel for what the anonymous base case would mean.
