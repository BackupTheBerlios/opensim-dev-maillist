<PRE>I'm sorry. This is an OpenSim discussion channel. So, we are interested in what OpenSim is doing and where we are going.

We have two different teleporting methods in OpenSim already. One is the AWG/OGP which allows teleporting from the LL betagrid to an OpenSim region. The other is the &quot;HyperGrid&quot;, which allows teleporting between OpenSim grids or regions.

We certainly can consider a third, and that certainly could be Rex. Or, certain Rex features may be added to the existing two interop technologies we already support.

So, with that in mind, lets move forward and discuss the technical details of how the Rex technology works and how some or all of it is appropriate to add to OpenSim.

Charles

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] rex auth &amp; avatar systems (Re: future rexviewer merger)

&quot;Rex avatar server was out and TPing from SL to a Rex grid was done
before LL made the gridnaughts. The Rex group is ahead of the curve.
It probably will not hard for them to retool and go backwards to be
compatible with others are doing. But you have to remember that Rex
server is really the leader, the others are just following and not
acknowledging the work that has been done already.&quot;

Please don't speak in the name of ReX pple particularly when you don't know what you are talking about.
