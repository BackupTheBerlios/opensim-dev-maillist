Strongly seconded.  There would be much love from us for anybody who isn't planning on directly contributing code to 
OpenSim but could do this kind of thing.

Bugging Lindens (nicely :-) for documentation might be good too, though I doubt this approach would go anywhere fast 
right now.  Or maybe there's even some out there already that we don't know about?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The challenge is to read the LL viewer source code and try to get an 
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of what the client expects from the servers with respect 
</I>&gt;<i> to region crossings and teleports. Here are some examples of things I 
</I>&gt;<i> would like to know:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - How are seed capabilities being used in the client?
</I>&gt;<i> - Do all child agents have their own seed cap, or do they share that 
</I>&gt;<i> seed with the root agent?
</I>&gt;<i> - Does the client care about who sends it seed capabilities?
</I>&gt;<i> - What is the expectation on the seed cap that is sent on 
</I>&gt;<i> EstablishAgentCommunication, CrossRegion, FinishTeleport?
</I>&gt;<i> - Do child agents have Event Queues? If so, when are they opened/closed?
</I>&gt;<i> - Under what circumstances does the client close or refuse to use an 
</I>&gt;<i> Event Queue?
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone is interested in doing this important piece of work, I have 
</I>&gt;<i> very concrete viewer log messages that can serve as starting points for 
</I>&gt;<i> mining the client code. Just let me know!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Crista
