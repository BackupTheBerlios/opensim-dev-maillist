</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">bounces at lists.berlios.de</A>] On Behalf Of Cristina Videira Lopes
</I>&gt;<i> Sent: Wednesday, December 03, 2008 9:40 AM
</I>&gt;<i> To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Opensim-dev] Event Queue
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apologies in advance for bringing up everyone's favorite hate topic,
</I>&gt;<i> but having spent most of yesterday tracking TP/crossing problems
</I>&gt;<i> (again), I can't help but bringing this up to a wider audience. I know
</I>&gt;<i> everyone hates the EQ. As it stands, there are several broken elements
</I>&gt;<i> with the EQ in OpenSim, beyond the obvious bugs caused by its
</I>&gt;<i> management. I'm just wondering if there is something here that I'm
</I>&gt;<i> completely missing, or if this is really this bad:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) It's implemented as an optional region module (!!!), configurable in
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.ini (!!!). That explains why, for example, I could not reproduce
</I>&gt;<i> crashes that other people have reported with older viewers. It turns out
</I>&gt;<i> that those people are not just using older viewers; they are using
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim servers configured with EventQueue=false. A complete
</I>&gt;<i> miscommunication.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) It's implemented as an optional region module -- the sequel. It is
</I>&gt;<i> being considered a [optional] part of the Region Environment,
</I>&gt;<i> something a region may or may not do. I'm afraid, this is the incorrect model.
</I>&gt;<i> The server side doesn't have any choice on this, if it wants to
</I>&gt;<i> interact with the current version of the LL viewer. The EQ should be
</I>&gt;<i> hand-in-hand with LLClientView. After all, it's the new channel of
</I>&gt;<i> communications between a server and the LL viewer. Things that used to
</I>&gt;<i> go over UDP are now sent via the EQ, period, no choice. Region
</I>&gt;<i> Environment should be completely oblivious to that change. As it is
</I>&gt;<i> now, this pattern occurs all over Region Environment classes:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>             IEventQueue eq =
</I>&gt;<i>             [scene.]RequestModuleInterface&lt;IEventQueue&gt;(); if (eq !=
</I>&gt;<i>             null) {
</I>&gt;<i>                 // send the event over EQ
</I>&gt;<i>             }
</I>&gt;<i>             else
</I>&gt;<i>             {
</I>&gt;<i>                 // call the right IClientAPI method to send the event
</I>&gt;<i> [over UDP]
</I>&gt;<i>             }
</I>&gt;<i>  This is infecting the server side with things that should be purely
</I>&gt;<i> client side. It's a horrendous way of getting at the question &quot;what
</I>&gt;<i> version of the LL viewer are you supporting in your region?&quot;. If there
</I>&gt;<i> is such a thing as a wrong question to ask, this is one of them. If we
</I>&gt;<i> want to support viewers with older communication stacks, then let's make
</I>&gt;<i> that explicit in OpenSim and subclass LLClientView for the N previous
</I>&gt;<i> versions of the LL viewer's communications stack. Region Environment,
</I>&gt;<i> and the whole of the OpenSim framework, should be insulated from that
</I>&gt;<i> mess, that's what the IClientAPI is there for. No OpenSim.ini
</I>&gt;<i> configuration variables, other than the already existing one:
</I>&gt;<i> clientstack_plugin=&quot;OpenSim.Region.ClientStack.LindenUDP.dll&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What will happen when Rex comes along? ... what version of the LL
</I>&gt;<i> viewer is that based on? ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for venting! I'm just sending this out to find the answer to
</I>&gt;<i> these three questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a) Am I missing something?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> b) Are there any objections to placing EQ under
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.Region.ClientStack.LindenUDP? (besides that name now being
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat incorrect)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> c) Should OpenSim be backwards compatible with viewers forked off from
</I>&gt;<i> older LL viewers *for the specific aspect of communications*? If so,
</I>&gt;<i> what design pattern should be used?, subclassing or alternative code
</I>&gt;<i> paths inside methods?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

In light of the security exploits found in the UDP protocol with RegionCrossed and EnableSimulator packets, there's a strong argument to be made for dropping support for insecure clients completely. Any client that has support for the event queue (any client released in the last year and a half I think) can receive packet events from the event queue, and recent clients can *only* receive certain events from the event queue. The event queue has been a fundamental part of the Second Life(tm) protocol for quite a while and IMO should be baked into the client stack right next to the UDP packet handling as a non-optional component.

I share the wider sentiments that doing reverse HTTP to send event messages to clients is a poor design decision. However, time would be better spent designing an improved protocol and modularizing the GPL client or developing a new client where the protocol stack can be manipulated.
