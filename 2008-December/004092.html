I would think that you'd want anonymous users to show up in the region
(i.e. not be invisible) so that people in the region know that someone
is there.  Call is psuedo anonymous, where you don't need credentials,
and you can't interact with the environment beyond speaking, and you
show up as a grey gob, but others can still see that you are there.

This wouldn't be too bad to implement in the existing system (though you
might have to play around with permissions to create an anon class of
users).
