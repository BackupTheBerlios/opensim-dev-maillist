I can see some people being hesitant to commit to supporting this
because they don't want to worry about committing to two branches each
time they have a fix, or they don't want to maintain two slightly
different code bases. Bug reports could also become more of a hassle as
some users will report bugs against the trunk, while others against the
stable branch.

Having said that, I can see a benefit for having a stable branch.
Ideally it would follow trunk pretty closely, and when it becomes
challenging to apply patches to both trees without too much massaging,
it's time to do final stabilization on that final branch and release.

I would like to encourage you to give this a try. If it works it's
likely to convince the other developers to play along, and if it fails,
we've learned our lesson. In the meantime, don't expect too much
commitment from all the devs, and be prepared to take responsibility
for this stable branch. After some time, we can all look back at how
things went and decide what to do in the future.

Mike
