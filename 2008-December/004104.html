That is true, and to be successful we really need to minimize unnecessary work.

However when it comes to making real production-ready software, its a
matter of professionalism and duty to commit to a certain set of
disciplines. Cross platform, security, documentation, testing,
branching, they're all something that isn't necessarily fun, but is
something we must do to have a code-base worth using.

We'll need a stable branch at some point. The only question is the
precise form of it.

At the risk of dead-horse beating, I like having only one active
branch, in stable/unstable cycles.

Cheers,
