<PRE>I think we should stick with the current system of regions that are running in the same instance of opensim.exe use internal calls. 

John Hopkin &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">opensim at jfhopkin.karoo.co.uk</A>&gt; wrote: This is probably a dumb question, and it's at best only tangential to
your current discussion, but here goes anyway ...

Would communications between regions hosted on the same region server
(ie one instance of OpenSim.exe using several &quot;Regions&quot; XMLs) still
use HTTP to communicate among themselves, or would they use messaging
entirely within the scope of that one server?

If they used HTTP - and for simplicity and compatibility I can see why
they might - would it not be advantageous to use internal messaging
instead, to (a) reduce the load on the network and (b) increase the
speed and reliability of comms to improve user experience?

Given that multiple regions hosted by a single server are often
adjacent on the grid and hence parent/childing (and also serving
region crossings) frequently, it strikes me that this could make a
significant difference in both those areas.

If this is a silly question, I'll understand - I don't pretend to know
the issues involved here in more than a trivial fashion.

Regards,
John Hopkin

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As for making comms a Region module, I'm +1 to that sort of idea. In the past I have from time to time, gone through removing direct references from scene, and region modules to the comms manager and instead routing them through wrapper functions in SceneCommunicationService. So that at some point we could refactor it to remove the current comms manager and make SceneCommunicationService into some sort of region module. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I know that recently we have started taking the reverse course and removing the wrapper function. Which also has its benefits as there isn't much point in having the wrapper if we keep the comms manager as it is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But anyway to answer your questions, if you have a REST childagentUpdate working and its a improvement on what we have, then I'd say that there shouldn't be any problem with replacing the old method as the way to get it in the quickest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But I think we really should have some better method to do comms plugin replacement/configuration in the future, weather that is by having it as a region module, or just improving the current system. So if you want to do that now, then I think that would be great.
