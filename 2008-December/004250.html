<PRE>It comes to light that the confusion I had wrt to the module on GForge is
the result of Melanie telling me she has groups mostly finished, yet I find
that the module on GForge is merely a module skeleton with zero
functionality.

As it turns out, Melanie did not post the module on GForge, Fly-Man did -
and Melanie is unwilling to open her groups code to the rest of the project.

I submit that we need to stop waiting on this code to appear, and start work
(or continue work, as the case may be), to implement groups ourselves.

Fly-Man is doing some productive work completing user profiles, and that is
perhaps the first place where the client touches groups, and in the least
substantial way; I think we could begin to examine the codepaths he is
presently working with, and in other places I have mentioned earlier in this
thread, and begin to put something together that we can at least patch and
troubleshoot.

Your thoughts?

Cheers,
James
