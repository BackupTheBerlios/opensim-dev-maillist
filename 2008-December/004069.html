<PRE>This is not about mutable notecards. This is about one particular 
case, attachment editing, and the desire to avoid thousands of dead 
assets being created by a single long attachment editing session, 
while at the same time not wanting to lose the work people have done 
in a crash.
I never intended to have this mutate into a discussion on changing 
the basic paradigm of immutable assets, but just to get one 
exception to that rule in one case where it is safe to do so and 
provides the most elegant solution for an otherwise tricky issue.

I am very unhappy that this got derailed into a discussion about 
making all assets mutable. This is not what i intended.

I may be better off maintaining nice, clean, working attachment 
persistence as a private patch.
