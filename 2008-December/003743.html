<PRE>+1 on this.  Likely far more mileage from cleanups like this than in refactoring to use lockless lists.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Lockless Lists?

I have a nagging feeling that we have quite a few constructs like this

A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D

where A locks on a mutex, then calls B that looks innocuous enough, but that in turn sometimes calls C that calls the long running/context switching D function.

Ususally, it's a bad idea to call foreign classes in a lock-block. Usually, it's quite easy to refactor blocks that do into blocks that don't.

And, I know that at least historically, I've seen constructs that lock in order to serialize calls, rather than to protect data. (Hello, OpenSim.Data)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Code has been checked in tonight as it doesn't look like it should cause

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ScenePresences (which I haven't touched yet) is probably the real
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; culprit there.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To be honest, I suspect the real issue on login/logout performance is the fact that mono does not yet implement thread
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prioritization - you can see it but properties such as Thread.Priority are merely stubs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So when a login/logout comes along it's not currently possible to give existing clients or threads such as the scene
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; update execution priority. So I'm thinking that the significant cpu spike on login/logout slows the whole system down.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I looked at login recently and I don't believe that the periods of lock holding are significant enough to be causing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delay.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No actual proper performance analysis was carried out so I could be wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using serverstats, something I've noticed is that on Linux after you get
</I>&gt;<i> a dozen people into your environment, system time of the process ends up
</I>&gt;<i> matching user time of the process (about 7% of total CPU for both).
</I>&gt;<i> This lines up with when the lag starts to get bad.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> High system time on linux means there is something the kernel is doing
</I>&gt;<i> for you that you need to watch for. Typically this includes locking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I tend to believe the locking is really the problem. Also, the china
</I>&gt;<i> team got their 1000 avatars simulated on OpenSim by doing lots of lock
</I>&gt;<i> removal. That work was over a year ago, but I suspect the approaches
</I>&gt;<i> are still valid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do think this is where our biggest choke point is right now. One
</I>&gt;<i> question I've got is whether the synchronized datastructures on mono are
</I>&gt;<i> more efficient than doing the locks yourself. On .NET that is known to
</I>&gt;<i> be true, but I'm not sure on Mono. I integrated one such change in the
</I>&gt;<i> packet outgoing queue 6 months ago, and got some confirmation that
</I>&gt;<i> stability went up after that change.
