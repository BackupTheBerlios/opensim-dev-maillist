<PRE>Ah, I wasn't aware it worked that way.  Thanks!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If they used HTTP - and for simplicity and compatibility I can see why

</I>&gt;<i>instead, to (a) reduce the load on the network and (b) increase the
</I>&gt;<i>speed and reliability of comms to improve user experience?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Given that multiple regions hosted by a single server are often
</I>&gt;<i>adjacent on the grid and hence parent/childing (and also serving
</I>&gt;<i>region crossings) frequently, it strikes me that this could make a
</I>&gt;<i>significant difference in both those areas.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I think we should use REST for most of the comms, but am a little bit wary about if it will be the right choice for some of the region to region comms. And if the overhead in lots of http requests/posts will be too much, for messages like ChildAgentUpdate that we should be sending quite often. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>As for making comms a Region module, I'm +1 to that sort of idea. In the past I have from time to time, gone through removing direct references from scene, and region modules to the comms manager and instead routing them through wrapper functions in SceneCommunicationService. So that at some point we could refactor it to remove the current comms manager and make SceneCommunicationService into some sort of region module. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I know that recently we have started taking the reverse course and removing the wrapper function. Which also has its benefits as there isn't much point in having the wrapper if we keep the comms manager as it is.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>But anyway to answer your questions, if you have a REST childagentUpdate working and its a improvement on what we have, then I'd say that there shouldn't be any problem with replacing the old method as the way to get it in the quickest.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>But I think we really should have some better method to do comms plugin replacement/configuration in the future, weather that is by having it as a region module, or just improving the current system. So if you want to do that now, then I think that would be great.
