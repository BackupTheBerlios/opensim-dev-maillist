Melanie,

If this is just about dead assets why not just open up a delete
interface to the asset database?  A database update to a blob isn't
substantially faster than delete / insert.  That's what was done with
the osDynamicTexture calls so that we stopped filling up the caches with
long dead assets.

I understand that updatable assets is a solution here, but it does open
up a can of worms.  If an interface is there for mutable assets someone
else will decide &quot;well, it would make case X easier, so I'll use it
there&quot; and not really understand that it's not going to do what they want.

Another issue with updateable assets is that it would make sha1 uuids
impossible.  I'd hate to give that one up for future implementation.

	-Sean
