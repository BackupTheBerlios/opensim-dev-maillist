I've seen a Youtube video of that and I have to say it looks stunning and awesome. I only have one question about it however: How will that feature be activated client-side for a linkset? The LL client doesn't offer a way to select two prims in a linkset and choose to add such a feature between them. Will the worst case apply where we'll have to go in the opensim console and write something like &quot;ninjalink LinksetPrimName1 LinksetPrimName2&quot;?

My personal belief on this is that such linking should be made an OSSL scripting function, which would also allow other features like turning the flexy bouncing on or off at will and specify properties like hardness, distance and others. So in that way, for a car you would put a script in the wheels and specify in a function in state_entry() how that should be like. Anyway awesome idea and congratulations to who made it, it rocks a lot. Can't wait for it to be in :)

Subject: [Opensim-dev] NINJA Physics - patch to allow joints for OpenSim

Hello all,

After receiving expressions of interest from a recent mailing list discussion about physical joints for OpenSim (<A HREF="../2008-November/003633.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/opensim-dev/2008-November/003633.html</A>), I've continued work in this area and it's progressed to the point that I have a patch I'd like to submit
for your consideration. I refer to the patch as NINJA Physics: Networked
INteractive Jointed Assemblies.  The NINJA Physics patch enhances the ODE physics in OpenSim with
joints, which are movable linkages between prims. This will allow wheeled
vehicles, ragdolls, and mechanical/robotic assemblies to be
interactively built within the standard viewer and controllable through
scripting. 

I've written some documentation about the usage, technical details, and current limitations of this patch: <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/index.php?title=NINJA_Physics.">http://opensimulator.org/index.php?title=NINJA_Physics.</A>  The patch itself is Mantis #2874: <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=2874">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=2874</A> . It's not finished or completely bug-free, but it illustrates the technical feasibility of this approach and, moreover, is quite fun to play with. I hope that with community help this feature can be discussed and further developed as part of OpenSim. 


Please let me know what you think!

Thanks,
N Lin (nlin / Standard Drucker)
