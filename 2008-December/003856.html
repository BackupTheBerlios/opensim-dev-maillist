<PRE>Well I never meant to suggest that we should use these tools if they arent
cross platform. I certainly did not suggest that, if they weren't, no one
should bring the subject up. I believe I also suggested that such adoption
needent be full-scale in the offing.

What I *did* say remains true: we have an obligation to move these tools
forward if we hope to benefit from them. And for those that can't afford the
time to assist with moving their native clients forward, there are
alternatives such as HomerH has just suggested.

As for complaints about the learning curve? They seem a bit tedious - there
*are* those in core who use these tools, and can and most likely will assist
in supporting them. The individuals in question certainly dont fail to
satisfy wrt any other requests for assistance. OpenSim has a learning curve
that is profound, and no other single application even remotely resembling
it is in common usage, so that curve pretty well starts at ground level.
Philosophically speaking, It feels a bit awkward to shy away from the kind
of effort we routinely require of others.

Reserve such decisions to core as you will - it certainly hasnt seemed to
impact the decision-making process of the other core members who have
adopted these tools successfully, in at least one case nearly a year past.

Just my *non-core* .02$L

Cheers
James

</I>&gt;<i> Also people jump up and down and shout loudly when something might not work

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But anyway I think the bigger problem for everyone is just the steep
</I>&gt;<i> learning curve that (from most feedback) those system take to even be able
</I>&gt;<i> to start using them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its easy to say everyone should swap to Git/HG, but when you are the one

</I>&gt;<i> a different matter. So I think this is something for the core team to
</I>&gt;<i> decide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And at this time my vote would be certainly -1 to swapping to them.

</I>&gt;<i> The reason I say this is that 1) we depend on 'very very very alpha code'
</I>&gt;<i> every day - in the corpus of the opensim work itself, and with the
</I>&gt;<i> employment of custom clients like hippo and meerkat. 2) if we hope to see
</I>&gt;<i> improvements in these toolchains that work to our benefit, we have an
</I>&gt;<i> obligation to adopt, test, and report, just as we ask of the broader opensim
</I>&gt;<i> community wrt the opensim project. This developement model works brilliantly
</I>&gt;<i> for us - why wouldnt we participate in it's employment for a different
</I>&gt;<i> important project?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, such an adoption needen't be simultaneously end-to-end -
</I>&gt;<i> incremental and progressive adoption by some of our more adventurous windows
</I>&gt;<i> devs might serve to inventory the trouble to be anticipated as adoption
</I>&gt;<i> progresses, perhaps filing bug reports to get showstopping issues fixed, and
</I>&gt;<i> blazing the trail forward into the more progressive and far more productive
</I>&gt;<i> workflows supported by these tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the benefits for the community are strong, and should be examined
</I>&gt;<i> in this light, rather than dismissed because they are nacent. If we all took
</I>&gt;<i> such a position, where would opensim be now?
