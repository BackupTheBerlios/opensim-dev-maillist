<PRE>Mircea,

I don't get the point of that. This behaviour is already implemented with
HyperGrid.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, it's again a matter of our 'base case' in OpenSim being

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would think that you'd want anonymous users to show up in the region
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (i.e. not be invisible) so that people in the region know that someone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is there. Call is psuedo anonymous, where you don't need credentials,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and you can't interact with the environment beyond speaking, and you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; show up as a grey gob, but others can still see that you are there.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This wouldn't be too bad to implement in the existing system (though you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might have to play around with permissions to create an anon class of
