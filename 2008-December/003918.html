This worries me in that it imposes some rules on what work we can be
doing on OpenSim. What if I have a great idea that I'd like to work on
before the details become murky in my mind, but we're in a &quot;stable
patches only&quot; phase? Given the distributed and varied nature of the
development team, I wondering how this would benefit the project as a
whole.

One way of achieving this is having two branches going on at the same
time (the stable one and the unstable one), so that there is always
somewhere I can commit my changes, regardless of their nature. Doesn't
this bring us back to Stefan's original suggestion of having a stable
branch?
