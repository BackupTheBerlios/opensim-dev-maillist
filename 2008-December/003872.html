Statements like the above make me feel just precisely the misgivings 
I had about Rex all along. I believe it could be less than 
beneficial for OpenSim to embrace Rex technology at this point, if 
the above is what Rex feel, that they should be leading the VW 
effort, maybe they should stay were they are and continue &quot;leading&quot; 
behind their closed doors.
I'm pretty sure I don't want their avatar server, now or ever! This 
only makes that resolve more firm.

I'd love to have meshes, but maybe we really should do our own, 
IEntity based ones and not even use the Rex efforts. We might be 
better off keeping our distance.

Melanie
