<PRE>Sure. I have no pre-conceived notion on which version of mono, the client or .NET, other then trying to keep us at the most modern stable version and try to cut down on some of our version inconsistencies.

My motivation at this point is reports from some that regions crash after an hour or so and from others that regions run for days or weeks. These reports make it more difficult to figure out what is going on.

So, my thrust in bringing this up is to try to get as many of our testers that are generating Mantisi and influencing development to all work with the same versions of mono, client and .NET as practical to attempt to cut down on the inconsistent test results we are seeing.

So, at this point, I am seeing client = 1.21.6, mono = 2.0.1 and .NET = 3.0. Is there anything else we need to be concerned about and are these the correct versions for now?

Charles

There&#8217;s still a number of us over using .NET. 
 
The current version of .NET distributed through Windows Update
is 3.0, so that needs to be tested too.

As the
resident muckraker, I would appreciate it if we could standardize on mono and
the client versions for a while until at least we can get past the current
spate of non-reproducible results.

It appears to me that mono-1.9.1 is the latest official mono and it appears to
me that the 1.21.6 client is the latest official client. Trying to standardize
on the latest official mono *and* the latest official client is one of the
things that has gotten us this far this fast.

Questions, comments, suggestions?
