<PRE>Corrected Version with some spelling mistakes fixed and other small changes.

I agree, and if we make the code and interface more shared between standalone mode and the Grid servers, then all the Grid server app have to be is minimum wrappers around the base classes. With them basically just registering http handlers. 

This allows there to a gradient between full standalone mode and full Grid mode. Different application are going to require different levels of functions and embedded services.

With one application maybe requiring a embedded Grid and User server in the single instance but using external Inventory and Asset servers. And these Inventory/asset servers could be shared with other applications/grids. 

Also I think future work on hyper grid could improve these sort of applications. Allowing applications that require minimum separate backend support, but being part of a bigger hyper grid.

There are so many different applications/ case uses that we haven't really even started to think about yet, that I think it would be a massive mistake to make the distributed grid servers we have now, the only way of using Opensim.

For this reason we feel standalone mode is important and needed but for the majority of what we plan in 2009 HyperGrid is a revolution we are really happy to see as we would   love to be part of a bigger community of similar OpenSim grids.

  -1, I think standalone mode is a important feature, and will become more important in the future
 
  I do think though, that we can do a lot more to cut down the code paths and make the grid services share code and interfaces better with standalone mode

 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Kyle,
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; I'm going to claim utter and absolute selfishness here and state that
 &gt;&gt;&gt; I cannot see any situation under which I would have only 1 location
 &gt;&gt;&gt; open in the  3D web.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; But others can and do - especially the out-of-the-box noob or the app
 &gt;&gt; dev just wanting to throw up a region to test a module.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; For the purpose of &quot;easily getting things set up&quot;, standalone is all
 &gt;&gt;&gt; but useless in its initial state. It's certainly easier to get set
 &gt;&gt;&gt; up, but it's also much more limited.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; It has one glorious use : letting people get an instant taste of
 &gt;&gt; OpenSim. That's probably what got us this far this fast.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; Grid mode is perhaps a bit more difficult to set up -- but the
 &gt;&gt;&gt; default in the configuration file is for the Null storage plugin to
 &gt;&gt;&gt; be used under standalone mode. This makes things... difficult... when
 &gt;&gt;&gt; trying to explain how to get modifications to the environment saved.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; For region persistence, it's SQLite,  not Null?
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; Because
 &gt;&gt;&gt; first, you have to explain how to configure the storage for the other
 &gt;&gt;&gt; modules (again, for standalone).
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; I must admit I'm a bit confused as of what resources you mean need
 &gt;&gt; configuration and extra set-up. Can you be more specific?
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; Also, I've been following the posts on the topic of the HyperGrid. I
 &gt;&gt;&gt; need more information on this: will it work for any of the minigrids
 &gt;&gt;&gt; to be in standalone mode when they try to connect with the HG? My gut
 &gt;&gt;&gt; feeling says no... and my reason for promoting grid over standalone
 &gt;&gt;&gt; is simply this: the HyperGrid is much closer to what the web is --
 &gt;&gt;&gt; multiple administrative domains that all work together to pass
 &gt;&gt;&gt; traffic between them. I don't view HG as being the final evolution,
 &gt;&gt;&gt; but I do view  it as being a very good start.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Definitively - HG is a major step along the very lines we've been
 &gt;&gt; envisioning since the very beginning - when we first started using the
 &gt;&gt; phrase &quot;3D Web&quot;. Let's not forget the &quot;friendly teleports&quot; region
 &gt;&gt; handle hacks of old. This is all building one step at a time, towards
 &gt;&gt; a golden future. The project has come a long way in only two years.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; And I'm pretty confident that there's even more magical stuff brewing
 &gt;&gt; on private hard drives and in corporate offices. :D
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; (And thank you, as always, for your time. :))
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; And thank you for yours, Kyle!
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; /Stefan
