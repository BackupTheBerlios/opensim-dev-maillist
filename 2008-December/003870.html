<PRE>My apologies, Crista. I was only trying to get the discussion back to a technical basis. 

So, the question is how should the UGAIM change to accomodate Rex notions.

 To be precise, the comparison is not really between the hypergrid and
Rex's avatar server; it's about comparing Rex's avatar server with
OpenSim's User+Asset+Inventory trio. 
The hypergrid is simply adding the capability of region servers
interacting with several of those trios instead of just one.

So, the unclear spot, really, is why Rex felt the need to substitute
UAI with something else.

I'm sorry. This is an OpenSim discussion channel. So, we are
interested in what OpenSim is doing and where we are going.

We have two different teleporting methods in OpenSim already. One is
the AWG/OGP which allows teleporting from the LL betagrid to an OpenSim
region. The other is the &quot;HyperGrid&quot;, which allows teleporting between
OpenSim grids or regions.

We certainly can consider a third, and that certainly could be Rex. Or,
certain Rex features may be added to the existing two interop
technologies we already support.

So, with that in mind, lets move forward and discuss the technical
details of how the Rex technology works and how some or all of it is
appropriate to add to OpenSim.

&quot;Rex avatar server was out and TPing from SL to a Rex grid was done
before LL made the gridnaughts. The Rex group is ahead of the curve.
It probably will not hard for them to retool and go backwards to be
compatible with others are doing. But you have to remember that Rex
server is really the leader, the others are just following and not
acknowledging the work that has been done already.&quot;

Please don't speak in the name of ReX pple particularly when you don't
know what you are talking about.
