<PRE>I think that a peer-to-peer database system, such as a distributed
hash table, would be better than a centralized host.

</I>&gt;<i> Excellent idea, Charles. It would be fun to have group conversations while
</I>&gt;<i> on my standalone. Here are some thoughts on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The UAI is a trio of services centered on individual users. The M is
</I>&gt;<i> bridging between individual users, and starts moving into the support for
</I>&gt;<i> social activities. For groups, what we need is a Group service. (Note I'm
</I>&gt;<i> using the word *service*, which may or may not be implemented as a server) I
</I>&gt;<i> would love to have a group service that would work in p2p mode. So, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, through my standalone's group services, I could join some group
</I>&gt;<i> that you have set up in OSGrid. And you could join a group I create on my
</I>&gt;<i> standalone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two interesting questions are how to (a) specify and (b) find groups. For
</I>&gt;<i> (a), just like for everything else in the HG, groups have to be suffixed
</I>&gt;<i> with the domain where they are created. So opensim-dev would probably be
</I>&gt;<i> opensim-dev@ <A HREF="http://osgrid.org:8006">http://osgrid.org:8006</A> or something like that. For (b) I can
</I>&gt;<i> imagine several things, from external data services to true peer to peer
</I>&gt;<i> search.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But having groups is not enough; you need group messaging, which ties back
</I>&gt;<i> to the M service.
</I>&gt;<i> The first logical step is to enable HG users to message each other, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> make M p2p too. I haven't looked at the M service yet, so I'm not sure
</I>&gt;<i> what's involved, but I'm pretty sure it's feasible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Taking from the experience of p2p-ing the UAI, I think a good strategy for
</I>&gt;<i> all of these services is to make things work within a [logical] grid first,
</I>&gt;<i> and then p2p that by having users carry along the addresses of those
</I>&gt;<i> services as they move around. So service interaction with an HG user always
</I>&gt;<i> goes to the address that the user is carrying around. (Hey, inventory use
</I>&gt;<i> this; hey Asset use that; hey Messaging, use that other; etc)
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We spend a lot of time on IRC these days and are missing the chance to use
</I>&gt;<i> our sims more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we had even a modest implementation of groups, then it would be possible
</I>&gt;<i> for folks to be testing building &amp; scripting and our IRC activities could,
</I>&gt;<i> in some measure, move over to a &quot;HyperGrid Group Chat&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to encourage us to think about this and see if there is a way
</I>&gt;<i> to begin some modest implementation.
