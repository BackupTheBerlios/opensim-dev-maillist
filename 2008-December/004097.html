As far as I know, HyperGrid is about allowing an avatar to teleport into a linked grid only if they come from another grid where they have to have logged in as registered users first. A guest system wouldn't be about traveling from one grid to another (unless guests will later on be allowed to teleport between grids too which is a separate topic), but about anonymous people being able to log into a grid with a random name if they aren't registered... at least the way I imagine it.

Mircea, 

I don't get the point of that. This behaviour is already implemented with HyperGrid.

My own idea was not having guests as 'ghosts' or as invisible avatars unseen by others... I believe that would be against the purpose. My vision was that a guest could log in like any registered user with any random first name and the last name &quot;guest&quot;, and be wearing the default ruth avatar (girl with gray shirt and red pants) just like what a registered user is wearing the first time they go in-world before they get theirselves a custom avatar. Guests should also have all the library inventory of opensim as well, just not a persistent inventory of their own as that wouldn't be possible.


Oh and now that that's been brought up and I think about it, maybe guests could even have their own special guest avatars rather the default opensim ruth, so they could for example be wearing a shirt saying &quot;guest&quot; and look accordingly (eg: dressed up like someone going in a visit to somebody else or someone going in vacation).
