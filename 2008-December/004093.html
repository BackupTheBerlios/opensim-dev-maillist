The ability to break things in trunk is what lets it evolve so quickly.
 I do realize that everyone wants both &quot;all the features&quot; and &quot;all the
stability&quot; at the same time, but I'm a realist, and that's just not
possible in OpenSim at this point.  We're at least a year out from 1.0
which will start to have that.

&gt;<i> I'd like to see a 'stable' branching system of some kind, and every
</I>&gt;<i> time there's a new stable candidate I'd like to see a diff produced
</I>&gt;<i> and examined for Justin's 2 weeks to see if there's anything that's
</I>&gt;<i> obviously broken between the former stable and the new candidate.
</I>&gt;<i> Once it's determined to be stable enough, it would get committed to
</I>&gt;<i> trunk and a new -stable branch forked from that revision.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Two downsides to this suggestion is that it means that everyone's
</I>&gt;<i> going to need to become really familiar with the process of re-basing
</I>&gt;<i> their local copy, and everyone's going to need to listen to the
</I>&gt;<i> release coordinator to know when to re-base their locals.  The former
</I>&gt;<i> is a documentation problem (write a page on the wiki to describe how
</I>&gt;<i> to do it); the latter is an announcement problem.  (I'd suggest the
</I>&gt;<i> creation of a new opensim-announce list that only the release
</I>&gt;<i> coordinator(s) can send to, and which has a membership list precisely
</I>&gt;<i> equal to the opensim-dev list?  This would allow the announcements to
</I>&gt;<i> be handled separately, but allow memberships to be handled only by a
</I>&gt;<i> single administration request... but I don't know how good of an idea
</I>&gt;<i> it is.)
</I>
The problem with proposing something that causes someone else work, is
it is likely to not happen.  If you are signing up to do a lot of said
work, I applaud you. :)  If you are suggesting others do it... the
suggest is always welcomed, but don't be too surprised if it doesn't
come to fruition.
