<PRE>
Esteemed colleagues,
It has been time to tag a stable branch for some time now.
 
Since trunk is currently considered anything but stable, are people feeling up for trying out branching a stable version before we do this, and then actually work on that branch to stabilize it? (Merging back changes to trunk where applicable of course)
 
(It's not as hard as you think merging revisions, really - especially if the revisions are reasonably local)
It seems we really would need to create a still pool for the people that just want to run their stuff.
 
So, I propose we branch 0.6.1-stable but not necessarily tag it. Maybe, at some point, we can tag 0.6.1 from this branch, and lo and behold, we have (almost) had a proper release cycle!
 
Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB

There was a thread about this a couple of months ago in which&gt; the resolution was to wait until 0.6 was released.&gt; &gt; Here are the pros - cons as I see it:&gt; &gt; Cons&gt; * a change like this, no matter how prepared we are, can cause some&gt; temporary breaks in people's environments&gt; &gt; Pros&gt; * xengine uses less memory than dotnet engine&gt; * xengine uses less cpu than dotnet engine -&gt; <A HREF="http://xyzzyxyzzy.net/2008/11/07/a-brief-look-at-dotnetengine-vs-xengine/">http://xyzzyxyzzy.net/2008/11/07/a-brief-look-at-dotnetengine-vs-xengine/</A>&gt; * xengine doesn't do the event drop which causes lots of bug reports&gt; like this one: <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=2777">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=2777</A>&gt; &gt; I'm sure there are other pros and cons, and I'm happy for others to&gt; throw them out here. I've been telling every IBM internal team to use&gt; XEngine for the past 6 months, and every one say a performance and&gt; stability increase after they made the change.&gt; &gt; I think that making it the default out of the box will reduce a lot of&gt; issues that new users are having with OpenSim, and it definitely along&gt; the lines of trying to make as much work right out of the box as we can.&gt; &gt; Opinions? Comments? I'd like to try to achieve consensus over the next&gt; couple of days so we could make such a change.&gt; &gt; -Sean&gt; &gt; -- &gt; Sean Dague / Neas Bade&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">sdague at gmail.com</A>&gt; <A HREF="http://dague.net">http://dague.net</A>&gt; &gt;
