<PRE>I encourage some sort of stability policy, even if its only a 1 week
process of polishing up a be-knighted release.

I would also like to take this opportunity to propose time-based
releases, like GNOME or Fedora, where you work for X months, stabilize
for Y weeks, then tag what you got, and restart the process again. I
think it provides a lot of simplicity in planning, removes the
potential of having multiple active branches, and makes it easy to
identify where patches should go.

Cheers,

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I can see some people being hesitant to commit to supporting this

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> some users will report bugs against the trunk, while others against the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stable branch.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Having said that, I can see a benefit for having a stable branch.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ideally it would follow trunk pretty closely, and when it becomes
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> challenging to apply patches to both trees without too much massaging,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it's time to do final stabilization on that final branch and release.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I would like to encourage you to give this a try. If it works it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> likely to convince the other developers to play along, and if it fails,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we've learned our lesson. In the meantime, don't expect too much
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> commitment from all the devs, and be prepared to take responsibility
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for this stable branch. After some time, we can all look back at how
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> things went and decide what to do in the future.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem with stable branches... is they aren't.  If you add code to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a branch, you have the potential to break it, especially on a source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> base as complex as OpenSim.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Personally, I'm going to stay focused on trunk, that's where my time and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interest lies.  A better approach to stability than stable branches is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to help create unit tests for trunk.  This helps contain behavior, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drives towards code correctness for parts of the tree.  Over time,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that's the only way to have a truly stable tree.  It has prevented
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dozens of bugs from going into the tree already.  I'd encourage people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spend time on enhancing automated testing instead of doing point in time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stable branches.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with all that Mike said above (and, at the same time, I also
</I>&gt;<i> agree with all that Sean said: it is good to have more tests, and it is
</I>&gt;<i> easier for developers to just have trunk to commit to. However... ;)
</I>&gt;<i> Regardless of its alpha status, OpenSim is already being used in a
</I>&gt;<i> variety of deployments. This is the reality - OpenSim is being used, and
</I>&gt;<i> users are part of the equation (officially or not, that's how it is
</I>&gt;<i> today). The lack of any form of proper release system is making it
</I>&gt;<i> difficult for those users to strike the balance between relative
</I>&gt;<i> stability and the feature set of OpenSim snapshot that is being
</I>&gt;<i> deployed. Each, so called, &quot;OpenSim release&quot;, has its problems, and
</I>&gt;<i> users tend to &quot;fix&quot; those problems by following the trunk, which makes
</I>&gt;<i> the current &quot;release&quot; model pretty meaningless. New trunk revision often
</I>&gt;<i> fixes some of the old problems, but introduces new ones. For users that
</I>&gt;<i> maintain and manage any form of OpenSim deployment, this represents a
</I>&gt;<i> major hassle, and it also makes OpenSim harder to use (and perhaps even
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat reduces its perceived value). I'm not talking here about
</I>&gt;<i> developers - I'm talking here about people that use OpenSim. E.g. we use
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim in the national virtual world grid that runs over research
</I>&gt;<i> network in New Zealand. The project is all run by volunteers and
</I>&gt;<i> university staff. We do not contribute much code, however, given enough
</I>&gt;<i> time, interest and traction of the project itself, there is a growing
</I>&gt;<i> users and developers base that study and gain experience with OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> technology. Following the trunk and maintaning a reasonable level of
</I>&gt;<i> stability in the grid is pretty much a full time job. It wouldn't be, if
</I>&gt;<i> there was a slightly better stable release system.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, one can say that the users are not important at this stage,
</I>&gt;<i> that OpenSim is only for developers to have fun, work on the trunk, and
</I>&gt;<i> do not spend time committing bug fixes into more than a single branch.
</I>&gt;<i> But, I am not sure all of the developers would agree with that. I
</I>&gt;<i> honestly believe that even at this stage, users are, somewhat, relevant
</I>&gt;<i> to the entire process, and helping the users will ultimately benefit the
</I>&gt;<i> project in the long run. Stable branches are of great help here. And
</I>&gt;<i> also, one of the easiest solutions to a relative stability of releases.
</I>&gt;<i> Users would use those stable branches, and potentially contribute back
</I>&gt;<i> comments and perhaps even patches, that are made against those stable
</I>&gt;<i> branches. Lots of open source project use that model successfully and I
</I>&gt;<i> agree with Mike that perhaps you folks should give it a try.
