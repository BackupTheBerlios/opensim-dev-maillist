<PRE>Could we have this conversation without the politics? Those issues got 
seriously in the way of Rex's ability to collaborate with OpenSim. I'm 
not sure if you, Destiny Miles, speak for realXtend, but if you do, and 
if Rex wants to continue to focus on press releases announcing its 
leadership, I suspect that is not going to serve them well here with 
this community.

There are many ways of connecting virtual worlds, not just one. What is 
it that the avatar server does that the HG doesn't do?

I'm asking this question not because time-line or technical leadership 
issues, but because the hypergrid is publicly documented and 
well-integrated with OpenSim without any major redesigns, and Rex's 
avatar server is neither of those things. As far as I'm concerned, Rex's 
avatar server can be much better than HG! I think what everyone wants to 
know is *how*. That explanation is still not not public, only the 
headlines are.
