Subject: [Opensim-dev] Distributed grid services / LDAP login status

A status update on where the distributed grid services project is at:

* The distributed asset server project
(<A HREF="http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/assetserver/">http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/assetserver/</A>) has turned into the
distributed grid services project. The asset server is almost at the same
functionality as OpenSim.Grid.AssetServer.exe (it cannot create the MySQL
database from scratch, but everything else seems to be in order), inventory
functionality has been merged into the asset server, and a user server
project has been started to provide distributed authentication for the other
services.

* OpenID endpoint support is functioning in the asset server. You can
currently log directly in to the asset server with an OpenID. Work has begun
on an end-to-end protocol for authorized access to the asset server using
the user server as an OpenID provider. The process works slightly
differently from most web OpenID logins in the case where you have already
logged in to a user server, since you are only reconfirming your identity
with a session cookie (automatically) at that point.

* Inventory support only has a file-system backend currently, a MySQL
database backend that is compatible with the existing
OpenSim.Grid.InventoryServer.exe backend is on the short term roadmap.

* Login with the new user server is functional. There are still a lot of
XML-RPC calls to implement, which will happen right after the distributed
authentication is tested.

* LDAP login is working. Since the LL viewer cannot easily support direct
LDAP logins (it MD5 hashes the password before sending it), a simple web
interface was added at /ldap that, upon login, will create a new avatar with
your LDAP first name, last name, and hash of your current password. This
could be merged into a larger account creation interface.

* The asset server is powering an internal grid at Intel and appears to be
performing well. The next step is to roll out to external grids for more
thorough testing soon.

The asset server is the most documented service at this point. A general
overview of the vision is available at:
<A HREF="http://www.opensimulator.org/wiki/AssetServerProposal">http://www.opensimulator.org/wiki/AssetServerProposal</A>

Wire protocol documentation:
<A HREF="http://www.opensimulator.org/wiki/AssetServerProposal/ClientDocs">http://www.opensimulator.org/wiki/AssetServerProposal/ClientDocs</A>
Documentation of the asset server codebase:
<A HREF="http://www.opensimulator.org/wiki/AssetServerProposal/DeveloperDocs">http://www.opensimulator.org/wiki/AssetServerProposal/DeveloperDocs</A>

Additionally, a simple implementation of the asset server has been written
in ~200 lines of Python as a Google AppEngine script for testing. A live
instance of this trimmed down version is running at
<A HREF="http://assetserver.appspot.com/">http://assetserver.appspot.com/</A> (code is in SVN at trunk/AppEngine). If you
use this for testing, please play nicely until authentication is added.
