<PRE>I would concur that the four connected sims at a corner is a good idea. There will be challenges at the four corner crossing, and there will be challenges with chat crossing sim boundaries. But, I think we are now at the point where tackling the issues at &quot;four corner&quot; and &quot;chat across borders&quot; is sufficiently important to be worth the effort of testing, understanding and fixing.

Great Americo although I am by FAR not an OpenSim expert compared to Neb and many others and
even to Chris Hart on my own team. I have just been focused on server specs
under load for many months now. Just simply staring at the numbers and watching
what users do. 
 
When it comes to the guts
of OpenSim there is little I personally can comment on as I am a web developer
not a server application developer. More of a mashup/end
user guy though my team has deeper expertise in C#/.NET/SQL.  But as a former Navy Electronics Tech I am
very good at hardware maintenance and uptime. 
 
Keeping submarines
operating embedded a sense of urgency in me J. Troubleshooting procedures
taught me about isolation, half splitting and other valuable methods to finding
faults.
 
I will only pop in a
comment when it is something I have witnessed myself firsthand and also my
hopes for OpenSim performance. At 20 avatars on one sim,
after login, our CPU went back to almost idle usage which makes me wonder how
high we can go. 
 
So my guesswish is with monster hardware (maybe current?) we can do 30-50 avatars reliably on a
single sim. If not we will see if 4 connected sims helps.  We
will also ask the OpenSim devs to help us with this
test and suggest various unique tests as we are planning this to be a community
event IF we get sponsors. We have some real bites now.
 
I very much defer to the
core devs on the ultimate in advice I am a noob here as well really as far as OpenSim capabilities
overall.

 Thanks, Kyle. Your answer was very important to me. I am one of the few
guys in Brazil trying the use of OpenSim and have
received, some days ago, a consult from an important brazilian university
asking me about the possibility of the creation of a 3D &quot;virtual
campus&quot; having many resourses, included the auditorium for 500. My answer
was: &quot;We need to wait a little more to know if this is possible. My first
impression is that it is not an easy task to do it.&quot;.
 I am not an OpenSim expert like you but your answers confirm  that
didn't say anything very wrong.
