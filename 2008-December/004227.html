<PRE>Yes, absolutely. Perhaps we could add some features to the MessagingServer or a region module. It depends on how you think the architecture will evolve to be most beneficial.

I would think that just *one* group to start with and get it working. Then after that one group channel becomes unwieldly, we can be ready with the next version for *more then one* group.

If it can be done so it is HyperGrid-centric, then it transcends grids and standalones and helps us build more of an OpenSim community.

Of course, I would not be offended if OSGrid plays a major role in the whole idea. Perhaps by hosting the database.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Groups and using our sims more

 Excellent idea, Charles. It would be fun to have group conversations
while on my standalone. Here are some thoughts on it.

The UAI is a trio of services centered on individual users. The M is
bridging between individual users, and starts moving into the support
for social activities. For groups, what we need is a Group service.
(Note I'm using the word *service*, which may or may not be implemented
as a server) I would love to have a group service that would work in
p2p mode. So, for example, through my standalone's group services, I
could join some group that you have set up in OSGrid. And you could
join a group I create on my standalone.

Two interesting questions are how to (a) specify and (b) find groups.
For (a), just like for everything else in the HG, groups have to be
suffixed with the domain where they are created. So opensim-dev would
probably be opensim-dev@ <A HREF="http://osgrid.org:8006">http://osgrid.org:8006</A> or something like that.
For (b) I can imagine several things, from external data services to
true peer to peer search.

But having groups is not enough; you need group messaging, which ties
back to the M service.
The first logical step is to enable HG users to message each other,
i.e. make M p2p too. I haven't looked at the M service yet, so I'm not
sure what's involved, but I'm pretty sure it's feasible.

Taking from the experience of p2p-ing the UAI, I think a good strategy
for all of these services is to make things work within a [logical]
grid first, and then p2p that by having users carry along the addresses
of those services as they move around. So service interaction with an
HG user always goes to the address that the user is carrying around.
(Hey, inventory use this; hey Asset use that; hey Messaging, use that
other; etc)

We are at the point where I believe some modest group
implementation would help us move along significantly. Particularly, if
our group implmentation had HyperGrid notions are were grid-agnostic.

We spend a lot of time on IRC these days and are missing the chance to
use our sims more.

If we had even a modest implementation of groups, then it would be
possible for folks to be testing building &amp; scripting and our IRC
activities could, in some measure, move over to a &quot;HyperGrid Group
Chat&quot;.

I would like to encourage us to think about this and see if there is a
way to begin some modest implementation.
