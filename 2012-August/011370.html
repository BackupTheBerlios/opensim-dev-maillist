</I>&gt;<i> documented  here -&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/OsForceAttachToOtherAvatarFromInventory">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/OsForceAttachToOtherAvatarFromInventory</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> ..  as you can see from the history of that page   it was created 
</I>&gt;<i> almost a month before your patch was submitted...
</I>It doesn't replicate osForceAttachToOtherAvatarFromInventory(), it 
&quot;replicates&quot; llAttachToAvatar() 
<A HREF="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlAttachToAvatar">http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlAttachToAvatar</A>

osForceAttachToOtherAvatarFromInventory() is for adding an attachment 
from the object's inventory to a specified avatar, llAttachToAvatar() is 
for adding the rezzed host object to the object owner.
The patch I've attached is for attaching the host object to the 
specified avatar, the sole difference to llAttachToAvatar() being the 
specification of the avatar.


&gt;<i> Second problem with this function...   and  one i added to the talk 
</I>&gt;<i> page on the wiki...
</I>&gt;<i> Unless that object is unscripted OR is removed when the avatar exits 
</I>&gt;<i> the region or disconnects,
</I>&gt;<i> this sounds like a heap of griefer trouble...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What happens when I visit a region where an object scans me, attach a 
</I>&gt;<i> malicious package to me,
</I>&gt;<i> and then take advantage of the fact that attached objects don't 
</I>&gt;<i> require permissions to

</I>&gt;<i> into someones else space???
</I>&gt;<i> Is MY fault  I didnt check all of my attachments before and after i 
</I>&gt;<i> TP'd???
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are so many reasons why asking for permissions works, and owning 
</I>&gt;<i> the objects that are attached to you makes sense..
</I>&gt;<i> The  ONLY valid reason I have ever come across for someone wanting to 
</I>&gt;<i> attach something to me without me owning it is
</I>&gt;<i> DEMO prim/mesh clothing/accessories   That functionality IS supported 
</I>&gt;<i> in SL  via lAttachToAvatarTemp 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlAttachToAvatarTemp">http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlAttachToAvatarTemp</A>&gt;... and ASKS.
</I>There are two functions in the patch. One asks, one doesn't. Your sole 
concern seems to be the potential for griefing with the 
osForceAttachToOtherAvatar() function and not osAttachToOtherAvatar(), a 
concern that would seem to be addressed by either raising the threat 
level of osForceAttachToOtherAvatar(), or just not including it.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like I said above..  making this functionality accessable to NPC bots 
</I>&gt;<i> who cannot leave the region, and currently cannot grant permissions, 
</I>&gt;<i> MIGHT be a use case..   But since you make no distinctions...
</I>I could implement another pair of functions designed for NPCs if you'd 
like, that's fairly trivial.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess the bottom line is...  there's some code there, yes... but 
</I>&gt;<i> even if it is functional,  it is going to take more than filing a 
</I>&gt;<i> mantis to get it worked on and reviewed...   Part of that work is 
</I>&gt;<i> defining and communicating the NEED for the function  so it can be 
</I>&gt;<i> balanced against the implications of implementing it.
</I>At work I needed to attach a wheelbarrow (and in future, other tools &amp; 
equipment) to the user without
a) transferring ownership
b) constantly interrupting them with permissions dialogs- as is required 
by llAttachToAvatar()
c) performing the ungraceful hack that one would do in Second Life with 
many attachments that remain attached to the avatar but are invisible 
until needed, or one that is invisible and changes appearance as needed.

This scenario is accompanied by a function that permits script-triggered 
dropping of attachments (in both perms and non-perms flavours)
