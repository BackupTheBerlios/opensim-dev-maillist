I'll look into it.  Honestly, right now I'd rather start with cleaning
what we've got before trying to consolidate it again.  I think part of
why this continues to be elusive is that there are so many
inconsistencies even within existing drivers that it is hard to see the
forest for the trees.  Having been doing some parallel work on 3 db
drivers of late (sqlite, mysql, and nhibernate) I'm starting to see some
 patterns that make sense, but I'd rather just make some incremental
improvements at this point and see where those go, instead of promissing
a new approach to unification here.
