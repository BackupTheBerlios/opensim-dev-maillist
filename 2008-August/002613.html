<PRE>I actually have 8 grids, with each grid running 8 servers.  No, I am not
rich, I am using cloud services, which are working quite well.  I rarely
have more than the basic 8 turned on (one server - landing regions for
each grid), and even then shut some off for periods to save money.
Right now it is behind a private wall, but I will be opening it up soon,
so if anyone is curious, I will add my grids to the grid list.  At any
rate, after reading the blog post I began wondering, and justincc does
deal with this -  Right now, all they share is registration.  I wrote
some scripts so that registration with one puts the user info in all the
databases.  Except for that, all 8 grids are separate.  Inspired by the
blog post, I started thinking if it would be possible to share some
resources, so that a user could have their inventory and user info
stored in one place (right now the php scripts just copy the same user
info to the 8 databases and each grid has their own set of UGAI).  I
suppose I could just try this, but do you think that would work?  If I
change the setup so that all 8 ini's point to the same inventory and
user server, but in all other regards they are separate?  Any
suggestions if it is more complex then that?  I am guessing it is more
complex than that.  If anyone has some suggestions on where to start
playing, I am happy to try it out.  Many thanks in advance,

Drew
