<PRE>I believe that the individual drivers approach should not be dropped.
Any abstraction/generalization would of necessity forgo performance 
enhancing database features and would therefore be detrimental to 
the scaling behavior down the road.

For databases off the beaten track, we could possibly provide a 
generic or abstracted driver, but, IMHO, a very specific, high 
performance MySQL driver needs to stay as part of OpenSim.

That said, the current one isn't really all that high performance, 
but that is where it needs improving.

Converting current db providers to the Base framework really should be a breeze.
