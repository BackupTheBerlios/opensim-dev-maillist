The rel/absolute bits (pos, vel, acc, rot, ang vel) seem to be the crux
of why that back reference is needed.  And the crux of why we need to do
it that way today is that we determine absolute position on read of an
attribute.

If we change the problem around and calculate them on write of a parent
attribute (i.e. obj.Position triggers a cascade of changes to set it's
children's AbsolutePosition), I think we can get rid of the back
reference.  It also has the added benefit of making the read case just
reading existing attributes, and take the cost of the reference frame
change on the write case, which seems a more logical place to impose
that tax.
