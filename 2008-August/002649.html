<PRE>While reading through the messages I receive about new Mantis entries
related to scripting and attachments, it occurred to me that the processing
needs for a region should go up as these new features are implemented. I've
noticed several of the sites out there offering regions on their grids have
fairly startup and monthly fees, which I assume may be partially based on
the cost of running a simulator with 0.5.8 Opensim code. Some cost
assumtions that may not support this could be:

* How many scripts are continuously running in a region

* How many scripts an avatar is allowed to have in attachments and how often
they do expensive operations such as channel 0 listens, sensor scans, and
high frequency high load timer events such as those found in many animation
overriders

* How many prims are in a region and how complex they are. It seems many
grid operators are offering 45,000 prim limits but my testing indicates that
may be an impossible number, especially when full meshing is used to support
physics.

There are probably other factors that escape me now, but these are the ones
which I currently find salient.

While I've enjoyed being able to host several OSGrid regions on minimal
hardware up until now, I may have to ration what new features are available
in my regions or consider upgrading to more capable hardware. I have the
feeling others will also, and I suspect that the prices some of the grid
operators are offering will need to rise unless they can successfully ration
features as well.

Comments? Suggestions?
