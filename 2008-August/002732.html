<PRE>I was having similar issues. In my regions table in the mysql database,
there was a region with a zero UUID. I removed everything from the regions
table and then removed everything from the terrain table. Obviously I had to
reload the terrain from the raw heightmap files. The regions table gets
rebuilt on startup anyway. I'd check both tables for &quot;suspicious&quot; entries
(and, as always, backup everything before you start removing tuples from a
table).

Sorry,
I should have added that I am currently using revision 5969 but this has 
been an ongoing issue with past revisions for me as well.

Thanks,

</I>&gt;<i> My grid environment consists of servers running Windows server 2003 R2

</I>&gt;<i> No Firewalls
</I>&gt;<i> We're configured using Meshmerizer, OpenDynamicsEngine and DotNet script

</I>&gt;<i> region as being down... but to other users it's fine, the user reporting 
</I>&gt;<i> the down region cannot see into the region.. only a blank area of water, 
</I>&gt;<i> they cannot teleport to it and if they try to cross into it.. they will 
</I>&gt;<i> crash. 
</I>&gt;<i> While this is happening.... others interacting with this region are

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only way for this user to get back into this region is to reboot the 
</I>&gt;<i> simulator instance this region is on... but... other users are using and 
</I>&gt;<i> logging into the region fine.
</I>&gt;<i> The problems seems very random in nature... it happens on regions where 
</I>&gt;<i> we have scripts enabled, disabled, lightly loaded regions, more than 1 
</I>&gt;<i> user and sometimes no users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pings and traceroutes show no abnormalities server to server or user to 
</I>&gt;<i> servers during these issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have anyone else had any problems like these?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been searching for a solution to this for the past couple of
