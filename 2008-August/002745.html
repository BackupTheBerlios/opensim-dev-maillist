Look at the save-oar/load-oar functionality and tell me if this is what 
you're talking about.  This currently saves out and reloads a tar.gz oar 
region archive (prim xml + the assets needed to restore this prim + 
region terrain).

The export tool is something of a shell at this point, though it might 
be nice to get it to be able to load/save archives without needing the 
opensim region to be running.  This will involve a good bit of 
refactoring to isolate the components of OpenSim that need to be reused.

One thing you might think about adding is inventory archive 
loading/saving, which is basically the same thing as for regions, but 
with inventory :-)  I made a start on this but haven't had time to make 
much progress recently.
