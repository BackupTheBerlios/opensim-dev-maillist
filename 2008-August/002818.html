<PRE>It may be possible that the multithreading patch I did could be having some impact here - perhaps there's something dependant or relying on a particular order of operations? (I cant think of anything myself, but that doesn't preclude the possibility)

Subject: [Opensim-dev] Added fields to OpenSim tables

I really dont like to complain as it tends to inhibit forward motion, but this morning several folks are spending time working on the fact that many accounts cannot log onto OSGrid and I suspect this problem affects other grids as well.

It seems there are a number of recently added fields in our OpenSim tables. Lets concentrate on homeRegionID for a minute.

I am told that 20% of the logins to OSGrid are failing this morning becuase this field is all zeros for existing accounts. Certainly, the grid admin's can set this field to some value, such as a plaza. But, that is not my issue.

My issue is a request that when new fields are added to tables in OpenSim that the adder of the new field add a paragraph to our wiki explaining what this change is and offer enough data so that existing grids can accomodate side affects with existing users.

This morning, I look closely at the users table and I can see five fields added since the last time I looked closely. These five fields are homeRegionID, userFlags, godLevel, customType and partner. There may be other fields added to other tables. I dont know offhand.

All I am requesting is that when fields are added to our tables that some sort of trail of clues is left on our wiki to help our users and early adopters move forward.
