<PRE>OpenSim Dev Team,

I want to give you a heads up on something I'm involved with announcing 
at the Virtual Worlds conference next week that you might have interest 
in / want to check out.  I've been volunteering some time with a few 
other individuals to start a Virtual Worlds Roadmap special interest 
group that significantly impacts the industry.  As the name implies, the 
group is intended to work together to create and publish rigorous 
descriptions of what will be needed to move the virtual worlds industry 
to achieving mass adoption across numerous applications.  We've done the 
work just to establish the organization and are now looking forward to 
pulling people together to arrive at and publish answers / useful content.

I think this effort could really help the industry through informing 
investment and action.  This isn't a standards group or a long-term 
vision.  There's a session to kick off / announce effort at a session at 
the Virtual Worlds Conference (1-2pm on Thurs., Sept. 4th) and I'll then 
be helping to put out a call to participate in some upcoming working 
events.  I'll send out the information when we have it available, but it 
would be great to see some of you at the session if you can make it and 
then talk about how you might want to participate. 

We would like to make sure that your thinking, opinions, and experience 
gets into the mix.  More later...

Best Regards,

Jeffrey Pope
Executive Vice President
