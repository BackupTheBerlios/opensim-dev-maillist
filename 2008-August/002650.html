I agree with your concerns. Naturally as more demanding features are
added and used, this will push hardware utilization limits.

Are you suggesting a system for limiting the items below?

&gt;<i> * How many scripts are continuously running in a region
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * How many scripts an avatar is allowed to have in attachments and
</I>&gt;<i> how often they do expensive operations
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * How many prims are in a region and how complex they are
</I>
I'm sure such a system would be beneficial. Besides the performance
considerations, it would also grant region owners pretty fine grained
control over what they allow or disallow to occur in their regions.
That could be very useful.

(A real-life example of giving region owners control over their region
that comes to mind is giving cinemas the ability to block mobile phones
in the theater.)
