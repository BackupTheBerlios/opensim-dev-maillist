<PRE>Hi,

That TESTING.txt document is pretty out of date.

&gt;<i> I'm hoping that there's a single command to run all the unit tests

</I>
There is.

The tests are contained in certain DLLs. At the moment, these DLLs have
tests in them:

OpenSim.Region.ScriptEngine.Common.Tests.dll
OpenSim.Region.ScriptEngine.Shared.CodeTools.Tests.dll
OpenSim.Region.ScriptEngine.Shared.Tests.dll
OpenSim.Framework.Tests.dll OpenSim.Region.Environment.dll
OpenSim.Region.Physics.OdePlugin.dll[1]

The console command used to run the tests is `nunit-console` (or
`nunit-console2` on some systems). This command takes a listing of DLLs
to inspect for tests.

Currently Bamboo's build file (.nant/bamboo.build) lists only those
DLLs for nunit-console to use. However it would be equally correct to
simply pass in all DLLs in bin/; those without tests are just skipped.

The nunit-console generates a file TestResults.txt by default. This is
an XML file containing a listing of all DLLs inspected, tests executed,
successes, failures, etc. If nunit-console is passed in all DLLs in
bin/, this file bloats with lots of entries like this:

      &lt;test-suite name=&quot;/home/mike/source/workspace/bin/OpenSim.Grid.Communications.OGS1.dll&quot; success=&quot;True&quot; time=&quot;0.000&quot; asserts=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;results /&gt;
      &lt;/test-suite&gt;
      &lt;test-suite name=&quot;/home/mike/source/workspace/bin/OpenSim.Region.ClientStack.dll&quot; success=&quot;True&quot; time=&quot;0.000&quot; asserts=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;results /&gt;
      &lt;/test-suite&gt;

Therefore it makes more sense to me to specify the DLLs when running
nunit-console.

As for the TESTING.txt document, I could update it with the contents of
this email. Would that be useful?

Hope that helps,
Mike

1. Note that OpenSim.Region.Physics.OdePlugin.dll is in bin/Physics/
and needs to be first copied to bin/ before nunit-console is executed.
