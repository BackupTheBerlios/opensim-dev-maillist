<PRE>Hi,

I have to second the move for independence. Much time, also mine, 
has gone into removing or avoiding libsl references in core. Libsl 
has it's place in LLClientStack, where it provides connectivity to 
the one client that actually uses that protocol.

Countless hours have been spent to refactor _from_ libsl tyoes _to_ 
axiom, and the LSL implementations are different again, and need to 
be, if we want scripts to run unmodified, and, thinking onwards, 
achieve SL interoperability on a binary level.

Libomv seems to be a requirement only for the one use case of 
emulating SL, for any other scenario not using the SL client, that 
lib creates a huge amount of code overhead. Much of it isn't used in 
OpenSim as it stands.

Actually, it should even be broken up further.

libMetavrseTypes: Quaternion, Vector3, Color4, LLUUID, etc
libPackets: _Packets_.cs and the needed stuff to support using it.
libOpenMetaverse: All the rest, that OpenSim doesn't ever need.

Then libMetaverseTypes, which should have an API stability guarantee 
and whose types should be made serializable again, could be used 
throughout.

libPackets would be used in the LLClientStack exclusively

libOpenMetaverse would not be needed by this project.

Melanie
