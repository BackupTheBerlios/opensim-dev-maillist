<PRE>The GPL says that you can copy, you just have to make the source of
all binaries you distribute available.  It's a license which specifies
its conditions for revocation.

I don't really understand the problem with the GPL.  If you make
custom changes to the code and don't give the binary out to anyone,
/you don't have to give the source out/.  (The only exception is
called the GPL Affero license, which states that if you make changes
to a server you must give the code to those changes out to the users
of that server -- but that's applied primarily to content management
systems.)

I'd like to see the 'transcoding is copying' ruling you allude to --
the very recent Veoh case on the surface appears not to allow that
interpretation.  Since I'm confused on the topic, I'm looking at Title
17 of the US Code, which is all about copyright... and I'm still
rather confused.

Is there a lawyer in the house?
