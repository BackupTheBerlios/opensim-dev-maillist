<PRE>I need to back off my &quot;many accounts&quot; and change it to &quot;a few accounts&quot;. I was relying on reports from others.

But, my point is not the failure being reported, but the fact that I would really, really appreciate a wiki paragraph whenever a field is added to any table in OpenSim so that existing users, grids and early adopters can more easily move forward. 

In addition, this has the added benefit of making our documentation more complete, so it is a win-win situation.

It may be possible that the multithreading patch I did could be
having some impact here &#8211; perhaps there&#8217;s something dependant or relying on a
particular order of operations? (I cant think of anything myself, but that doesn&#8217;t
preclude the possibility)

Subject: [Opensim-dev] Added fields to OpenSim tables
 
I really dont
like to complain as it tends to inhibit forward motion, but this morning
several folks are spending time working on the fact that many accounts cannot
log onto OSGrid and I suspect this problem affects other grids as well.

It seems there are a number of recently added fields in our OpenSim tables.
Lets concentrate on homeRegionID for a minute.

I am told that 20% of the logins to OSGrid are failing this morning becuase
this field is all zeros for existing accounts. Certainly, the grid admin's can
set this field to some value, such as a plaza. But, that is not my issue.

My issue is a request that when new fields are added to tables in OpenSim that
the adder of the new field add a paragraph to our wiki explaining what this
change is and offer enough data so that existing grids can accomodate side
affects with existing users.

This morning, I look closely at the users table and I can see five fields added
since the last time I looked closely. These five fields are homeRegionID,
userFlags, godLevel, customType and partner. There may be other fields added to
other tables. I dont know offhand.

All I am requesting is that when fields are added to our tables that some sort
of trail of clues is left on our wiki to help our users and early adopters move
forward.
