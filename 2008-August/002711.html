<PRE>Dear Mo:

Could you amplify and describe what you mean by a &quot;staging testing environment like the SL Beta grid has served&quot; so that we (or perhaps just I if everyone else knows) can understand what you mean?

I would agree that using a grid that is used provides the most motivated testing environment.

On the other hand, I haven't read anything about the need of a staging test environment, like the SL Beta grid has served.

One of the main goals of OSGrid is to provide a consistent testing environment with a variety of known and controlled configurations.

In general, the plazas are the most known and controlled and a number of developers have access to the plaza consoles whenever they wish.

There are regions that I and others have setup that represent various use cases. Things such as:

Yang - One region, one server, reasonable RAM, Linux, DSL from a home
'Moons' - Four regions running on one OpenSim.exe instance in Linux, DSL from a home
Celt - Small VPS (256MByte RAM) in colo in the UK

These just represent a small sample. They all get reasonable traffic and the plazas, both LinuxPlazas (Wright, Lbsa) and the WindowsPlazas (Zaius, Bade, SeaPrior, Teravus) have very significant traffic, if not the most traffic of any existing OpenSim regions on any grids.

In general, we are encouraging folks to test and report with the latest secondlife.com official client, but there are folks testing with a variety of clients.

So, we already have a system testing environment in place.

I would urge us to define via wiki or mantis a few recipes for regression tests and take advantage of the hundreds of folks logging into these and other regions each day. 

Or, one could consider some bot testing using the regions setup for testing Opensim. That certainly is another reasonable action.
