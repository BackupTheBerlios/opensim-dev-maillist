<PRE>It's my understanding that we are all aiming at providing such a module repository someday.
 
Now, when talking about collecting test data, one of the things I've been thinking of is an (opt-in, I guess) exception collector - ie, something that posts all exceptions (+stack traces) being thrown to a central repo, where one can sort exceptions on file, version and number of occurrences.
This has worked very well in several projects I've worked with before, and becomes an invaluable tool for the debugger, to be able to browse thru various instances from various reporters, on the same exception. Also, to be able to sort the list into a top-10 severity.
 
I guess there's already several existing frameworks for this (doesn't JIRA have this, for example?) - unfortunately, I've only worked with minimal and home-grown versions - but just having the collecting is a really good first step.
 
I would believe that in that case, this would be a case of centralizing exception logging (something sorely needed anyway) and implement some kind of application module to interface with that exception repo?

All that talk of user-contributed and automated testing reminds be of CPAN. I know. I know. Perl is tired old tech to some. But perhaps in the far distant future the number of OpenSim modules might approach a level where a CPAN like repository of submission and testing conventions would even emerge. APIs and test trusses will make it easier for users to submit testing on different platforms in a conventional format, (something the Perl community really mastered, imho). I know it is a way off, but being able to dowload someone's module or contribution, plug it into my sim or even just a test truss and generate consumable test results is just too cool to not hope for someday. Justin, let me know if there is anything I can do to test the testing. ;)

In addition to the ideas that MW (and others) have discussed, I'd alsolike to put forward the idea of increasing our level of automated unitand regression tests for the 0.7 release.Previously I was more in favour of pushing forward quickly rather thanspending too much time test writing (and I think this was how it waswhen I joined the project).  However. we're now approaching the pointwhere a reasonable amount of functionality has been filled out inOpenSim (at least from the Second Life POV).  Greater reliability isgoing to be necessary if the platform is going to be used seriously forgrid and enterprise level activity.   Naturally, there's a level ofself/company-interest here ;-) but I think that spending time on thiswill benefit many if not all of us.Of course, automated tests certainly won't be a perfect safety net buthopefully it would help to improve OpenSim by catching the revisions inwhich regressions are introduced.  This will also mean refactoring willbe much less error prone.  I'm most probably preaching to the choir here.I think that part of this will mean pushing the test results from buildsinto the IRC channel (as already discussed with Sean), and making testresults more prominent (perhaps even on the opensimulator.org front page?)Personally, I hope to start putting some of FRI's coding time where mymouth is and start doing some work towards this this later on next month.--justinccJustin Clark-<A HREF="Caseyhttp://justincc.wordpress.com_______________________________________________Opensim-dev">Caseyhttp://justincc.wordpress.com_______________________________________________Opensim-dev</A> mailing <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">listOpensim-dev at lists.berlios.dehttps</A>://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev_______________________________________________Opensim-dev mailing <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">listOpensim-dev at lists.berlios.dehttps</A>://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev
