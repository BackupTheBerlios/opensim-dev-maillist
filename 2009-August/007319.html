<PRE>Thanks for the information Melanie and James.
So you believe the better way to do this is provide a web for to directly
modify the MySQL database that holds the assets information? Admittedly, I
know little about MySQL and so I knew I could work with the xml files.
Perhaps some more information about my project is in order. I am working
with a team of college students and faculty at my university to create a
website that will allow building a virtual area in a virtual world. For
example, a prebuilt object would exist in an avatars inventory on OpenSim.
This object would be a prebuilt building, such as a museum, classroom,
conferenceroom, etc. We call this object a template. The template would also
have locations on the wall reserved for pictures. So the user would choose
through the website that they want to use the museum template, with specific
already in OpenSim images for specific image locations. Then the user would
click a &quot;build&quot; button that rezzes the customized template.
To accomplish this, each template has already been built in OpenSim and then
saved into its xml format (using the save xml2 command). When the user
selects what template and what textures they want to use through the website
interface, a program would go through the xml file and replace the default
template's texture information in that file with the texture information
related to what was chosen on the website. This creates a new xml file that
contains all of the information necessary to rez a customized building.
As I already have rezzing the template in OpenSim through the website and
saving the chosen pictures through the website, all I thought was needed was
replacing the texture information in the template xml file with the texture
information chosen from the website. That is why I was wondering where the
texture information is stored in the xml file. But it sounds like you are
suggesting I deal directly with the asset database instead of changing the
xml file? Are all linked prims that make up an object stored neatly in the
database and is the texture UUID also stored neatly in the database with the
linked prims that make up the object? To me it sounds like directly
modifying the database is more work than necessary but what do the rest of
you think?
Thanks,
Steve

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything to do with identifying what texture to apply to the object? Is
