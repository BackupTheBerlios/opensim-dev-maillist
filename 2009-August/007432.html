<PRE>Just to feed back on a bit of experience.. that may be worth bearing 
in mind for our user base.

We have had an Opensim setup for about 2 years - initially 
standalone, then grid, then standalone multi-region and grid 
multi-region for last year or so.  Its been working fine when I 
regularly updated it every few weeks, which I did up to march this 
year.  I could stay on top of the various changes to config file and 
the now VERY complex Opensim.ini, XCML config files, changing region 
XML file content, and opensim.exe parameters that were needed by 
keeping abreast of the blogs and dev mailing list (especially 
Justincc'e weekly blog is most helpful for this).

I tried once or twice about 2 months ago to see if I could update the 
old system, but only managed to break it. with the User server now 
stopping whenever I connect the SL viewer to iot fop all users on all 
home and last locations I have tested.  I cannot see why that is 
happening but decided to move on and get a NEW clean system and the 
reimport the saved OARs we have for the old content.

So, I just returned to try to get an up to date Opensim setup (using 
the 0.6.6 post fixes version) as a base.  I got a SQLLite standalone 
working - though the master avatar wsa just a cloud. is that normal?

But trying to get a grid MySQL version back is proving hard. I just 
spent an hour looking at the LONG Opensim.ini to see if I can spot 
new things I need, and see the even more complicated [Architecture] 
section at the end, which I guess I will have to work out and could 
be the cause of the problems, as it seems to need changes fro grid versions.

But its proving REALLY difficult.  The Opensim.ini is now really 
really complicated, and after 2 pretty much solid days of work, I 
cannot get a grid setup to run on a single machine running UGAIM and 
ONE region.. never mind the 12 we used to run.

Does anyone have some recent instructions on setting up in GRID mode 
on a single server for MySQL and a working Opensim.ini and any other 
config files I can copy and adapt to get this going?  Or general 
advice if everyone is having similar problems with 0.6.6? I think I 
have te UGAIM XML config files in good shape, as I deliberately 
generated them afresh using the prompts the servers run through at 
initial start up time, as I did not trust my old XML config files ot 
be up to date.

Any pointers much appreciates so I can make quicker progress.

----------------------

This also means upgrades are presumably out of the question at this 
stage of rapid developments in Opensim? is that the experience or are 
you all managing to upgrade still with the old upgrade instuctions of:

a) copy over the UGAIM XML config files (and region_settings.xml if 
its customiszed)
b) insert your required changes in a NEW opensim.ini ecah time
c) copy your region xml files into the regions folder
