<PRE>Hi Diva,

One way to achieve this, though perhaps not the best way, is to have a
branch with your changes based on the trunk. So, let's assume the
current trunk is a branch called &quot;master&quot; in the repo you clone from
opensimulator.org. This repo on opensimulator.org will is referred to
as &quot;origin&quot; in the repo local to your hard drive.

First, you'd clone the remote repo:

$ git repo <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">diva at opensimulator.org</A>/opensimulator.git
$ git branch
* master

Running `git branch` displays the branch you're currently checked out
into your workspace.

Then, you'd create your own branch for your feature:

$ git branch new_caps
$ git checkout new_caps
$ git branch
* new_caps
  master

This creates a branch in your local repo called &quot;new_caps&quot;. You check
out this branch, which means that your working directory now reflects
the state of this branch. At this point it's identical to &quot;master&quot;.

Now you hack away at your feature, making commits as you progress.

$ ... edit ...
$ git commit
$ ... edit some more ...
$ git commit
$ ... etc ...

You'll end up with something like this:

master   O---O---A---B---C
                         \
new_caps           D---E---F

where A is the commit at which you created the &quot;new_caps&quot; branch from
&quot;master&quot;, B and C are commits that have been applied to the &quot;master&quot;
branch by you or others, and E and F are some commits you made to the
&quot;new_caps&quot; branch you're working on.

At this stage, you want to bring your branch up-to-date with what's
going on in &quot;master&quot;. `git rebase` is perfect for the job.

First we pull any new commits that exist on opensimulator.org to your
local repository:

$ git checkout master
$ git pull

Now we will rebase the commits in &quot;new_caps&quot; on top of the most recent
commit in &quot;master&quot;

$ git checkout new_caps
$ git rebase master

Now your commit history will look like this:

master   O---O---A---B---C
                                    \
new_caps                      D---E---F

What git does is it finds the first common commit between &quot;new_caps&quot;
and &quot;master&quot;, which is A. Then, it takes all the commits in &quot;new_caps&quot;
since A and applies them to the tip of &quot;master&quot;, in order. When it's
done, your branch has all your changes, and it's up-to-date with all
the changes in OpenSim trunk :)

If there are any conflicts when you rebase, you'll be given the
opportunity to resolve them and continue on once you've done so.

Hope that helps,
Mike
