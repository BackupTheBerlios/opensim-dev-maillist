<PRE>About the only way to do a (near) realtime whiteboard that works with the standard secondlife client, is to do it like the prototype I did. 

Which basically embedded a Video streaming server into a opensim module. So you set the parcel media url to point to that video streamer. Then the module could handle the click/movement comands from the client (hooking into the opensim IClientApi events) and then in &quot;near realtime&quot; draw on the surface that the video streamer was sending to the clients. It also included a VNC bridge, so the module would act as a VNC client, and converted the VNC desktop into a video stream. 

As Stefan said, I wrote a prototype doing this, but it was just that... a prototype and lots of things would need doing on it before it was really usable. I've often meant to post the code to the forge but the biggest problem is that the code is mixed in with a lot of other custom code, so extracting it is going to take quite a bit of work. Which is time that at the moment I just don't have.

I know Darren implemented a pretty nifty&#160;real-time standard-issue SL viewer OpenSim whiteboard for drawing and placing images on, point and click - and the Rex people have been supporting VNC-on-a-prim for quite some time.

Best regards,

Subject: [Opensim-dev] Question: Collaborative tools in Opensim

Hi:

Yesterday, talking with a client who wanted something similar to a blackboard into Second Life, I was trying to remember if there is something similar for Opensim.

Not the clasical &quot;prim-on-rez&quot; blackboard (sometimes called &quot;sim overloader blackboard) or the web-over-prim refresher and all that &quot;almost but not&quot; stuff.

Something like the Project Wonderland X11 integration or VNC full integration, or event the OpenCroquet 3D painter. Some thing that &quot;really&quot; allows to save the collaborative work and access to external applications.

So, that's my question: does this stuff exists for Opensim or there are plans to develop something similar?

Thanks
