<PRE>I agree that our use of threads per user has been brute force so far, 
and any effort to reduce it is a good thing. I don't see any issues in 
trying what you suggest.

This reminds me of something I observed in the design of parts of the 
code. In many places we have these worker threads that stay on a loop 
processing stuff. A recently eliminated one was the old &quot;AssetCache&quot; -- 
that's gone, and its elimination made things much faster. But there are 
many more all over, especially those that process things for the client. 
I wonder if we can get rid of all those threads and move to a fully 
asynchronous event processing model, leaving the low-level thread 
management to .NET/mono. I'm not sure we can in all cases, just wanted 
to raise the issue.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A Scenario:

</I>&gt;<i> An instance serves a 9 gridspace set of regions.  The avatar logs into

</I>&gt;<i> instance.
</I>&gt;<i> --------
</I>&gt;<i> Before the LongPoll fix:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Each avatar created 9 threads for LLUDP processing, 9 threads stuck in
</I>&gt;<i> eventqueue processing, and several timer/threadpool threads.   This

</I>&gt;<i> For example..     at 14 users, there were 252 threads(14 root, 112

</I>&gt;<i> eventqueue of the users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -----------
</I>&gt;<i> After the LongPoll fix:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Each avatar creates 9 threads for LLUDP processing.  There are a total
</I>&gt;<i> of 4 threads dedicated to eventqueue processing total.
</I>&gt;<i> For example..   at 14 users, there are 130 threads(14 root, 112 child,
</I>&gt;<i> 4 in eventqueue) in use processing the udp stack and the eventqueue of
</I>&gt;<i> the users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i> If we set up worker threads for child agents:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Each avatar creates 1 thread for LLUDP processing, There are a total
</I>&gt;<i> of 4 threads dedicated to eventqueue processing.  And, there are (for
</I>&gt;<i> this example, we'll say 2 threads per region to process child agents),
</I>&gt;<i> 18 threads to process child agents.
</I>&gt;<i> For example..   at 14 users, that's 36 threads in use processing the
</I>&gt;<i> udp stack and the eventqueue of the users.
</I>&gt;<i> ----------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone think of issues with doing this?     I would /really/ love
