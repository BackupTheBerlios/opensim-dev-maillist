<PRE>Mark,

 

Just a couple of corrections:

 

I have heard no 'rage' from any core dev over the concept of an
&quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project. On the contrary, that is what we want to see happen,
preferably several currency projects targeting different usage models and
catering for differing audiences.

 

Whether or not currency management hosted by the core repository is pivotal
for the success of OpenSim or not is a matter of opinion. In my opinion, if
that would be the case, that would be a sad prospect for OpenSim indeed.

 

Managing an economic points system is no more central to OpenSim than it is
for the Apache web server. It might be pivotal for certain implementations
based on OpenSim, like it would be for certain e-commerce sites running on
Apache, but not for OpenSim itself.

 

The OpenSim core devs has repeatedly stated that we are willing to add
whatever reasonable hooks any currency module would reasonably need into the
core. Please open mantis issues and attach your patches, and we'll review
them like any other patch.

 

I fail to see the need to 'fork' the entire code base over this kind of
issue.

 

The Rex team forked before the OpenSim core were even aware of them. The
issue was whether to re-incorporate their codebase into core, something that
was decided against in the end. From what I can see, both projects have
continued to run in parallel just fine, each free to pursue their specific
development goals.

 

There has been mailings before pointing to existing currency module code
bases.

 

A friendly suggestion though; it's probably not the best way to start your
fledgling currency project passing remarks discrediting core devs and their
motifs.

 

Best regards,

/Stefan

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Currency

 

Jason/Colin/Rock/Aldon,

 

I completely agree with your stance on having a virtual currency
system/Karma system (whether it is or is not based on actual real-world
currency).

 

Companies like Zynga that do online gaming, have &quot;virtual currencies&quot; and
things such as &quot;virtual money&quot; and &quot;Godfather points&quot; in their Mafia Wars
games, and all of their other various games.

 

Yes, I agree that there needs to be some form of &quot;virtual currency&quot; or
points system.  There is no argument concerning &quot;virtual currency&quot; as being
unsecure, or inappropriate or any form of liability.

 

I'm not saying that OpenSim core needs to add a gateway to secure e-commerce
(such as PayPal) but there are lots of way to implement secure commerce.

 

First off, the &quot;points&quot; in the game, are nothing more than that.  They are
just points.  I've lost items (through &quot;gifting&quot;) before on other online
games, and it's really no big deal.  Tech support normally &quot;makes things
right&quot;.  But this is not a liability issue as much as this seems to be a
&quot;money making&quot; issue.

 

There seem to be some developers (in the core dev team) that may or may not
want to offer their OWN e-commerce system (as a service/money making
opportunity).  So I can understand their rage in the concept of someone
creating an &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project, because they may feel that it's a loss
of opportunity for them to sell a product (if someone gives it away for
free, as in air). Ultimately I feel that a points/virtual currency system is
vital to OpenSim's success. 

 

I believe e-commerce is an important part of Virtual World development, just
as e-commerce is an important part of the web. Trying to have a virtual
world without any form of e-commerce is similar to having an internet
without any form of e-commerce.

 

I've seen payment gateways for virtual worlds dating all the way back to
1996 (Active Worlds) and designing the core (securely) from the ground up,
so that it could handle a virtual &quot;points&quot; system would seem to make sense.
You don't need to build a mamoth of secure servers, as PayPal already does
much of that for you.  It would seem that just a simple module that would
work hand in hand with PayPal's API would suffice.

 

Linden dollars are nothing more than a points system.  Whether you choose to
call it Karma points, or currency, or virtual dollars, whatever the case...
it's still points.  It's NOT real money, it's NOT real cash, it's just
points. 

 

It would seem to make sense to create a separate OpenCurrency project as
Aldon suggested, as this seems to be an EXTREMELY important piece of the
OpenSim project.  

 

Designing a virtual world system (like OpenSim) without any form of points
systems (Karma, Currency, or whatever you wish to call it) would be similar
to designing a computer without a monitor, keyboard or mouse.

 

I understand the concept of having a 3D Virtual Chatroom (for educational
purposes and online learning) but 3D portals (such as Linden's) where people
come together, talk, chat, play online games, and engage in trading, etc.
some form of points or commerce system is critical.

 

If Core doesn't want to take part in the project (because they have their
own vested interests in their own personal ventures) then it may be in the
best interests of the Open Source Community to start a separate Open Source
&quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project, that is a separate entity from Core, and it seems
completely stupid to have to branch off and create a separate fork, but if
this is what the Core Devs want is a separate fork, then so be it.

 

RealXtend has had to fork, and it seems to hurt the OpenSource project as a
whole, because the forks eventually run independently of one another.  

 

It would seem to make more sense to just make the &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project a
part of OpenSim core (as a module) that can easily be enabled/disabled by
just installing the module, and enabling/disabling a flag in the OpenSim.ini
configuration file.  Something that will just allow the transfer of points
between users in the virtual world.

 

I believe something as simple as OS$ (open sim points, or open sim virtual
dollars) would be sufficient, similar to Linden's implementation.

 

&quot;I believe you are aware that I have a commercial RMT module, and had it for
more than a year.&quot;  Was not aware of that, but that's very good to know.

 

It would be good to create a separate &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project, and if it's
something that the core OpenSim developers don't wish to take part in, then
maybe it can be something that can be developed and added to the RealXtend
module and the RealXtend crew has done a fine job of adding additional
features, but either way we should be able to create a separate
&quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project independent of the OpenSim project, and possibly even
work hand in hand with the RealXtend developers, as a virtual currency
and/or virtual point system really would be crucial in online gaming, and
virtual social networks (the ability to exchange &amp; transfer points, and
objects/items between users).

 

It would seem that Core Dev are being very narrow (and closed) minded
concerning the idea of a points/karma system, but I would love to see an
OpenCurrency project started by a separate group, and something that can
easily be added (as a free module) to the OpenSim core.

 

&gt;<i>I will, if you can prove you know enough about computer security
</I>
&gt;<i> and writing secure code.
</I>
 

I'm not a developer, I'm a computer/network security engineer but I could at
least help with alpha/beta testing, and work on attacks, vulnerability
testing and security audits if need be (so that we can work on improving the
product).  

 

I really do think that an &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project would be great for the
OpenSim Community (and probably the number one, and most requested feature
for OpenSim).  

 

I'd be more than happy to join in on helping with the &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project
in any way that I can (such as technical writing, WIKI documentation,
tutorials, and vulnerability/alpha/beta testing).

 

The key point is to view OpenSim as a &quot;Virtual Gaming Platform&quot; and without
some form of points or Karma system, it really loses out as a real
interactive community network platform, and turns into a &quot;3D Chatroom&quot; which
has been done so many times before.  What made SL so different, was the
ability to trade goods, items, and even points between users.  This is a
very important aspect of Virtual Worlds, and it seems a key piece that core
devs want to leave out.

 

I guess the only solution is to create and form a separate OpenCurrency
project that is independent of the OpenSim project (similar to RealXtend)
and just work independently of the Core Devs on an &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project.

 

As I stated previously, I'd be more than willing to help in this venture.
It seems that Melanie already has some work/implementation that she has
already started, maybe we can start an OpenSource &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project and
build upon some of what Mel has already done, or work on building something
similar to what SL has done (using PayPal API's as a gateway, and using
Paypal to handle all the secure financial transactions).  This way the
OpenCurrency server simply holds the points/karma as just an item/object in
the asset server?  It would seem to make sense to just have a currency value
assigned to users.  If objects can be gifted between users (and not stolen)
then I can't imagine the problem with being unable to gift points between
users.  Some people like to act like the sky is falling, and attempt to
equate &quot;points=cash&quot; which they do not.  Many online games use a points
system, including Zynga, and SL.  A small handful of devs want to act like
the sky is falling anytime you mention anything about a points system, but
the code is still in the Alpha stages, and this would be the best time to
work on designing a module (from the ground up) so that OpenSim could be
made as a secure platform.  It's foolish to develop something without having
the vision to make it secure, and something that is expandable, and
something that can easily accept a virtual points/karma system.

 

Games such as &quot;Mafia Wars&quot; (that use virtual points as part of the gaming
experience) have well over 16.5+ Million active users, with over 3.4 to 4
million active players each day.  It would only make sense to include a
points system as part of OpenSim, and doesn't make any sense at all to
ignore such a key element in an online gaming or online virtual platform.
Some region/world operators may choose not to enable it, but it still should
be a part of core that could easily be enabled/disabled.

 

If Core Devs don't want it to be a part of core, then we may just have to
start a separate OpenSource &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project.  It may need to be a
separate module, similar to what RealXtend is doing, but I'm more than
willing to help with the effort in any way that I can.  (Website
development, Wiki documentation, technical writing, tutorials, alpha/beta
testing, vulnerability &amp; penetration testing, etc.)

I still experience an occasional hiccup with the Second Life money system so
i remain slightly wary of it.  Since money transactions remain a very buggy
and unreliable thing when it comes to virtual worlds, I've learned many new
ways to make financial gains without any in-world monetary implementations
at all.

At present I am gradually leasing out 25 regions from my own servers.  I
simply request payment be made via PayPal within the first 7 days of each
month and thus far I've not experienced any issues at all.  Everyone seems
very happy and I simplify things by only leasing out full regions rather
than trying to divide them up and lease out portions of regions.

While an in-world money system would at times be nice, and eventually will
come into being through optional plugins, I am quite happy managing my
virtual world properties through PayPal payments.

I think this illustrates extremely well why most of the devs don't want
to touch a money system. Making a proper monetary system means ensuring
that transactions happen, or do not, you can't get 7 copies of the same
transaction that then have to be unpicked by hand. I wouldn't be averse
to writing a money module if I had time (so, not this year), but I'd
want to do it properly so you can't get into this sort of mess...
