<PRE>If you're testing revisions, you might want to try 10051 or above
since this revision was directed to fix this incorrect behavior in the
attach/rez code.

&gt;<i> Gang,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;Before I plug this into Mantis, I wanted to confirm this with the
</I>&gt;<i> developers. &#160;Recently I've been noticing that after teleporting in or
</I>&gt;<i> attaching something my avatar has been getting bumped / tossed around
</I>&gt;<i> quite a bit. &#160;It occurred to me, that this seems like its typically a
</I>&gt;<i> physical reaction - as if one were to be hit with a physical prim or
</I>&gt;<i> collide into a static prim. So I looked up the top colliders in the
</I>&gt;<i> estate tools and found a whole bunch of colliding prims (~300 in total)
</I>&gt;<i> all at the same location and owned by me. &#160;Which was strange enough on
</I>&gt;<i> its own given the sim was empty of prims other then what was attached to
</I>&gt;<i> my avatar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;So to test I removed all of my attachments then suddenly the
</I>&gt;<i> collisions cleared. &#160;When I re-attached everything they returned. &#160;To
</I>&gt;<i> dig a bit deeper, I rezzed my hair and shoes to the ground, and found
</I>&gt;<i> that everything was normal, and the physics option was not ticked. &#160;Out
</I>&gt;<i> of curiosity, I set the hair and both shoes to phantom, took them back
</I>&gt;<i> into inventory, then re-attached. &#160;Surprisingly, no more collisions!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;From the looks of this it seems that when attached, prims are either
</I>&gt;<i> becoming physical and colliding with one another and the avatar, or more
</I>&gt;<i> likely are remaining normal / static and just colliding with the avatar
</I>&gt;<i> since they're not moving or flying haphazardly about as is typical of a
</I>&gt;<i> physical prim when bumped.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;Upon further testing though, I did however discover something rather
</I>&gt;<i> interesting. &#160;So far I've only tested with the skull attachment point,
</I>&gt;<i> but when a single prim is attached it acts normally. &#160;The avatar is not
</I>&gt;<i> bumped when it rezzes and no collisions show in the estate tools.
</I>&gt;<i> However, when two or more prims are linked and then attached the avatar
</I>&gt;<i> is bumped around and it seems that only the prims in the linkset that
</I>&gt;<i> are touching the avatar begin to register collisions within the estate
</I>&gt;<i> tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To reproduce this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - rez a single prim to the ground
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - take to inventory
</I>&gt;<i> 3 - attach to skull
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- Check the estate tools and no collisions show.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - rez several prims to the ground
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - link them
</I>&gt;<i> 3 - take to inventory
</I>&gt;<i> 4 - attach to skull
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- Check the estate tools and only the prims in the linkset which are
</I>&gt;<i> touching the avatar will show.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - re-rez the linkset to the ground
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - tick the phantom checkbox
</I>&gt;<i> 3 - take to inventory
</I>&gt;<i> 4 - attach to skull.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- Check the state tools and no collisions show.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if per chance this is related to the recent oddness with logins
</I>&gt;<i> / teleports / sim crossings where ODE has been going batty?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, :)
