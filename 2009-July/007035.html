<PRE>Hi,

this has been spoken about extensively, mostly on IRC. It is NOT 
about _changing_ OGS1. It's about replacing it.

OGS1 is a monolithic juggernaut that stubbornly resists evolutionary 
pressures. It can't be updates any more than the dinosaurs could be. 
The smaller, faster mammals (services) will push it out of the 
picture. This has already happened for assets and inventory.

The basic structure is as Diva describes:

IN_Connector -&gt; Service -&gt; Out_Connector

where each is optional.

So, a region will normally load either a service (standalone mode) 
or a out connector, which will then connect it to an in connector on 
a server that then loads the service.

The interesting part is that the system of connectors allows up to 
design more sane wire protocols - but not if we have legacy servers 
around that don't subscribe to the connectors system and lock the 
present wire protocol in place.

So, as B.U.S.T. gains implants for a protocol (using a compatible 
wire protocol plugin at first), the corresponding legacy server 
needs to go.
Then new protocol plugins can be developed that are more sane, allow 
more functionality, have more security, or whatever other 
improvements. The servers will be able to follow such protocol 
changes in mix &amp; match fashion by using appropriate connectors.

</I>&gt;<i> Thankyou for writing the existing documentation on BUST.  I'm sure if the new technology is well received then we can 
</I>&gt;<i> deprecate and remove the old servers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also don't like the name 'BUST'.  As we've already *very extensively seen*, we should not assume a sense of humour on

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In general I'm +1 for this since I'd really like to see the core settle

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prereq. for that.  I certainly understand the desire for doco so people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know what they're being asked for feedback on however.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Absolutely.  Asking for a general vote on progress is like proposing a vote on motherhood and apple pie.  We can only 
</I>&gt;<i> make meaningful votes on specific proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm actually now confused on whether you're asking for a vote on eventually deprecating the old servers (but not before 
</I>&gt;<i> another vote) or on changing basic grid protocols.  I assume it is the former rather than the latter.
