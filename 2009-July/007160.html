<PRE>As a linux user who has seen the positive impact on the quality of the linux
kernel since git went live for that project (for which git was designed
IIRC), I have to say that we need to give a high priority to adoption of
this tool.

As with any change, the benfits will not be immediate, and not without some
pain. But especially in this case, the benefits are within reach and quite
significant.

I, for one, have hope of making a contribution, as I can develop at my own
pace and synch up/rebase later - and should I happen to make a substantially
significant contribution, it is that much easier for core to incorporate it,
should that be desireable.

I'm all for it.
