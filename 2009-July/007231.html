<PRE>Hi Dahlia, yes - thats to be expected, what you're talking about is our
&quot;trunk&quot; branch which is what will eventually become 0.8 now that 0.7.0 is
officially released. We maintain API and Binary compatibility for all all
changes based on version numbering, for example 0.7.0 - 0.7.9 will stay
compatible and not cause any breaking changes. (same is true for 0.6.x
numbered versions). We've been doing this since around our 0.4.0 release
over a year ago. we will maintain this policy at least until a &quot;1.0&quot;
release so that as we continue to develop the library people can sticking
to major revisions can expect not to have anything break. Switching from
any major revision ie: 0.6 to 0.7 is guaranteed to introduce some breaking
changes, major revisions like this give us the opportunity to atone for
past sins we've made during the development of the library.

As the library is further developed towards 0.8 additional portions of what
is now in &quot;OpenMetaverse.dll&quot; will be moved to &quot;OpenMetaverseCore.dll&quot;,
this won't happen in one big monster commit, but as  incremental changes so
time and care is given in unwinding the dependency mess we've currently
got.

Regards,
Jim
