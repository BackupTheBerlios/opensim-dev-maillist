Yes, you (Melanie) have mentioned 'new' protocols but afaik this is the first I've heard of this.  Changing OGS1 
protocols is a big upheaval and should be properly laid out and peer reviewed before work starts. not after or during. 
Going down the wrong path now will be expensive later on.

If you can point me towards existing documentation on this (if it's part of BUST) that would be appreciated.

Thankyou for writing the existing documentation on BUST.  I'm sure if the new technology is well received then we can 
deprecate and remove the old servers.

I also don't like the name 'BUST'.  As we've already *very extensively seen*, we should not assume a sense of humour on 
the part of others.  A compromise would be to change the server prompt.

</I>
Absolutely.  Asking for a general vote on progress is like proposing a vote on motherhood and apple pie.  We can only 
make meaningful votes on specific proposals.

I'm actually now confused on whether you're asking for a vote on eventually deprecating the old servers (but not before 
another vote) or on changing basic grid protocols.  I assume it is the former rather than the latter.
