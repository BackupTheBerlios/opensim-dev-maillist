<PRE>Personally, I think it's important that the thread which handles packet 
processing and avatar movement should remain seperate from any other 
processing threads.

Aside from the fact that currently large operations have a tendency to 
cause the viewer to timeout,  I think that it's importand that the 
avatar should be free to move around, receive IM's, etc, when processing 
is taking place.

In fact, it's one of the most common complaints against opensimulator 
currently. Linking a lot of prims will cause the viewer to timeout, 
wearing attachments freezes the avatar, these quirks really need to be 
ironed out.

Just my unhelpful contribution :P
