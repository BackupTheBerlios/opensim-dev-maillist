<PRE>This stuff is somewhat of a work in progress.

One, there is a Mono bug. While .NET makes the variables for screen 
and window size track changes to the window, Mono does not. However, 
it also doesn't keep the process' window at a fixed logical size. 
Rather, it does the worst of all options: It doesn't tell us the 
size has changed, but throws an exception if your code assumes it 
hasn't. There is no way to get the new size even after the 
exception,, as the variables are never updated again after initial 
program start.

Now, in the region server, you can currently use -gui=true on the 
commandline. That tells it to expect being controlled by an external 
GUI, which makes the console go stdin/stdout with no fanciness at all.
If this is not used, you get the fancy, cisco-like console, but you 
also get the crashes when resizing. On .NET, resize is not an issue.

Two, The legacy UGAIM server lack support for this and always 
provide the fancy console only.

Three, B.U.S.T. has an option, -console=basic|local|rest, where 
basic is the stdin/stdout console, local is the fancy one and rest 
is a remote console connector using web protocols, which is a work 
in progress.

B.U.S.T. aims to replace the UGAIM, it already replaces A and I if 
configured. Therefore, the issue is really present only on U, G and 
M. G is the next server slated to be dragged into B.U.S.T., leaving 
only U and M for the moment.

The simple Console is actually part of UGAIM, it's merely missing 
the glue code to plumb the command line option through to the 
console. That could be added if really needed.
