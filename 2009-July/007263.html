<PRE>Hey there

I was just thinking..    does the child agent of an avatar actually
/need/ a full thread?    I ask this because we're running up against
the default thread limits of mono in situations where an instance is
servicing your root agent and 8 additional child regions.     The
LongPoll fix took the number of threads down by almost half, but,
we've still got a lot more work to do to make it reasonable.     Would
anyone object to having child agent worker threads that process more
then one client on the LLUDP side?     This would reduce thread usage
by at least 1/3rd over top of the savings that we already have from
the long poll fix.    I also note that textures are always served from
the region the avatar is a root agent in..  including textures in
neighbor regions that the avatar sees into.

A Scenario:

An instance serves a 9 gridspace set of regions.  The avatar logs into
the middle one and creates 1 root agent and 8 child agents on the
instance.
--------
Before the LongPoll fix:

Each avatar created 9 threads for LLUDP processing, 9 threads stuck in
eventqueue processing, and several timer/threadpool threads.   This
added up 'really' fast.
For example..     at 14 users, there were 252 threads(14 root, 112
child, and 126 in eventqueue) in use processing the udp stack and the
eventqueue of the users.

-----------
After the LongPoll fix:

Each avatar creates 9 threads for LLUDP processing.  There are a total
of 4 threads dedicated to eventqueue processing total.
For example..   at 14 users, there are 130 threads(14 root, 112 child,
4 in eventqueue) in use processing the udp stack and the eventqueue of
the users.

------------
If we set up worker threads for child agents:

Each avatar creates 1 thread for LLUDP processing, There are a total
of 4 threads dedicated to eventqueue processing.  And, there are (for
this example, we'll say 2 threads per region to process child agents),
18 threads to process child agents.
For example..   at 14 users, that's 36 threads in use processing the
udp stack and the eventqueue of the users.
----------

Can anyone think of issues with doing this?     I would /really/ love
to reduce the thread usage down to 'reasonable' levels here.   36
threads is WAY less then 252 threads!

Regards

Teravus
