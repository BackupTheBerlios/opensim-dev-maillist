<PRE>The way OpenSimulator is structured, I really think we need to have
that root agent UDP thread be a full thread.   It handles a LOT more
then the child agents currently.

As far as I know (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong though) , the
child agent, however, does only few things..    Object Updates.
Terrain changes, and connection keepalive.

It would almost make sense to have the child agent be a full thread
for a short time and then be relegated to a worker thread after some
event.   That event could be a certain packet processing threshold is
reached..   or..   the terrain and the objects have been sent to the
client.

As far as I know, the client doesn't disconnect and reconnect the UDP
connection when the client goes from a child agent to a root agent in
the sim (unless they teleport to a distant land)..   so there would
have to be a method for upgrading to a full thread and relegating to a
worker thread.

Best Regards

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyone object to having child agent worker threads that process more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then one client on the LLUDP side? &#160; &#160; This would reduce thread usage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by at least 1/3rd over top of the savings that we already have from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the long poll fix. &#160; &#160;I also note that textures are always served from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the region the avatar is a root agent in.. &#160;including textures in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> neighbor regions that the avatar sees into.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A Scenario:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An instance serves a 9 gridspace set of regions. &#160;The avatar logs into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the middle one and creates 1 root agent and 8 child agents on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> --------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Before the LongPoll fix:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Each avatar created 9 threads for LLUDP processing, 9 threads stuck in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eventqueue processing, and several timer/threadpool threads. &#160; This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> added up 'really' fast.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example.. &#160; &#160; at 14 users, there were 252 threads(14 root, 112
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> child, and 126 in eventqueue) in use processing the udp stack and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eventqueue of the users.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -----------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After the LongPoll fix:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Each avatar creates 9 threads for LLUDP processing. &#160;There are a total
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of 4 threads dedicated to eventqueue processing total.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example.. &#160; at 14 users, there are 130 threads(14 root, 112 child,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4 in eventqueue) in use processing the udp stack and the eventqueue of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the users.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we set up worker threads for child agents:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Each avatar creates 1 thread for LLUDP processing, There are a total
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of 4 threads dedicated to eventqueue processing. &#160;And, there are (for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this example, we'll say 2 threads per region to process child agents),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 18 threads to process child agents.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example.. &#160; at 14 users, that's 36 threads in use processing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> udp stack and the eventqueue of the users.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ----------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can anyone think of issues with doing this? &#160; &#160; I would /really/ love
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to reduce the thread usage down to 'reasonable' levels here. &#160; 36
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> threads is WAY less then 252 threads!
