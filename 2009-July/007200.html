<PRE>I honestly think your wasting your time arguing, It seems to me everyone is
just arguing this topic just for the sake of arguing, there are already Open
Currnency Modules available, the hooks for currency are already in, the Core
devs have done tons of work to make this happen, honestly not one thing you
said makes any sense to me, you are arguing things that are already done
saying they are not done and saying the devs are against.   I suggest you go
back and re-read what was said in this email thread, if you had spent as
much time working on a module as you had typing this book of and email, you
probably already would have had a Currency Module.   If you want this so
badly, then go ahead and do it, stop wasting everyones time talking about
doing it and just do it already, and if you are not capable of doing it
yourself, guess what, your also not qualified to talk about doing it with
the core devs.. So please just back off this topic and let people who are
qualified develop these systems.

&gt;<i> Jason/Colin/Rock/Aldon,
</I>&gt;<i> I completely agree with your stance on having a virtual currency
</I>&gt;<i> system/Karma system (whether it is or is not based on actual real-world
</I>&gt;<i> currency).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Companies like Zynga that do online gaming, have &quot;virtual currencies&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> things such as &quot;virtual money&quot; and &quot;Godfather points&quot; in their Mafia Wars
</I>&gt;<i> games, and all of their other various games.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I agree that there needs to be some form of &quot;virtual currency&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> points system.  There is no argument concerning &quot;virtual currency&quot; as being
</I>&gt;<i> unsecure, or inappropriate or any form of liability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not saying that OpenSim core needs to add a gateway to secure
</I>&gt;<i> e-commerce (such as PayPal) but there are lots of way to implement secure
</I>&gt;<i> commerce.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First off, the &quot;points&quot; in the game, are nothing more than that.  They are
</I>&gt;<i> just points.  I've lost items (through &quot;gifting&quot;) before on other online
</I>&gt;<i> games, and it's really no big deal.  Tech support normally &quot;makes things
</I>&gt;<i> right&quot;.  But this is not a liability issue as much as this seems to be a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;money making&quot; issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There seem to be some developers (in the core dev team) that may or may not
</I>&gt;<i> want to offer their OWN e-commerce system (as a service/money making
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity).  So I can understand their rage in the concept of someone
</I>&gt;<i> creating an &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project, because they may feel that it's a loss
</I>&gt;<i> of opportunity for them to sell a product (if someone gives it away for
</I>&gt;<i> free, as in air). Ultimately I feel that a points/virtual currency system is
</I>&gt;<i> vital to OpenSim's success.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe e-commerce is an important part of Virtual World development,
</I>&gt;<i> just as e-commerce is an important part of the web. Trying to have a virtual
</I>&gt;<i> world without any form of e-commerce is similar to having an internet
</I>&gt;<i> without any form of e-commerce.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've seen payment gateways for virtual worlds dating all the way back to
</I>&gt;<i> 1996 (Active Worlds) and designing the core (securely) from the ground up,
</I>&gt;<i> so that it could handle a virtual &quot;points&quot; system would seem to make sense.
</I>&gt;<i>  You don't need to build a mamoth of secure servers, as PayPal already does
</I>&gt;<i> much of that for you.  It would seem that just a simple module that would
</I>&gt;<i> work hand in hand with PayPal's API would suffice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Linden dollars are nothing more than a points system.  Whether you choose
</I>&gt;<i> to call it Karma points, or currency, or virtual dollars, whatever the
</I>&gt;<i> case... it's still points.  It's NOT real money, it's NOT real cash, it's
</I>&gt;<i> just points.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would seem to make sense to create a separate OpenCurrency project as
</I>&gt;<i> Aldon suggested, as this seems to be an EXTREMELY important piece of the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Designing a virtual world system (like OpenSim) without any form of points
</I>&gt;<i> systems (Karma, Currency, or whatever you wish to call it) would be similar
</I>&gt;<i> to designing a computer without a monitor, keyboard or mouse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand the concept of having a 3D Virtual Chatroom (for educational
</I>&gt;<i> purposes and online learning) but 3D portals (such as Linden's) where people
</I>&gt;<i> come together, talk, chat, play online games, and engage in trading, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> some form of points or commerce system is critical.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If Core doesn't want to take part in the project (because they have their
</I>&gt;<i> own vested interests in their own personal ventures) then it may be in the
</I>&gt;<i> best interests of the Open Source Community to start a separate Open Source
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project, that is a separate entity from Core, and it seems
</I>&gt;<i> completely stupid to have to branch off and create a separate fork, but if
</I>&gt;<i> this is what the Core Devs want is a separate fork, then so be it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> RealXtend has had to fork, and it seems to hurt the OpenSource project as a
</I>&gt;<i> whole, because the forks eventually run independently of one another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would seem to make more sense to just make the &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project a
</I>&gt;<i> part of OpenSim core (as a module) that can easily be enabled/disabled by
</I>&gt;<i> just installing the module, and enabling/disabling a flag in the OpenSim.ini
</I>&gt;<i> configuration file.  Something that will just allow the transfer of points
</I>&gt;<i> between users in the virtual world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe something as simple as OS$ (open sim points, or open sim virtual
</I>&gt;<i> dollars) would be sufficient, similar to Linden's implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I believe you are aware that I have a commercial RMT module, and had it
</I>&gt;<i> for more than a year.&quot;  Was not aware of that, but that's very good to know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be good to create a separate &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project, and if it's
</I>&gt;<i> something that the core OpenSim developers don't wish to take part in, then
</I>&gt;<i> maybe it can be something that can be developed and added to the RealXtend
</I>&gt;<i> module and the RealXtend crew has done a fine job of adding additional
</I>&gt;<i> features, but either way we should be able to create a separate
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project independent of the OpenSim project, and possibly even
</I>&gt;<i> work hand in hand with the RealXtend developers, as a virtual currency
</I>&gt;<i> and/or virtual point system really would be crucial in online gaming, and
</I>&gt;<i> virtual social networks (the ability to exchange &amp; transfer points, and
</I>&gt;<i> objects/items between users).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would seem that Core Dev are being very narrow (and closed) minded
</I>&gt;<i> concerning the idea of a points/karma system, but I would love to see an
</I>&gt;<i> OpenCurrency project started by a separate group, and something that can
</I>&gt;<i> easily be added (as a free module) to the OpenSim core.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I will, if you can prove you know enough about computer security
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and writing secure code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not a developer, I'm a computer/network security engineer but I could
</I>&gt;<i> at least help with alpha/beta testing, and work on attacks, vulnerability
</I>&gt;<i> testing and security audits if need be (so that we can work on improving the
</I>&gt;<i> product).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really do think that an &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project would be great for the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim Community (and probably the number one, and most requested feature
</I>&gt;<i> for OpenSim).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be more than happy to join in on helping with the &quot;OpenCurrency&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> project in any way that I can (such as technical writing, WIKI
</I>&gt;<i> documentation, tutorials, and vulnerability/alpha/beta testing).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The key point is to view OpenSim as a &quot;Virtual Gaming Platform&quot; and without
</I>&gt;<i> some form of points or Karma system, it really loses out as a real
</I>&gt;<i> interactive community network platform, and turns into a &quot;3D Chatroom&quot; which
</I>&gt;<i> has been done so many times before.  What made SL so different, was the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to trade goods, items, and even points between users.  This is a
</I>&gt;<i> very important aspect of Virtual Worlds, and it seems a key piece that core
</I>&gt;<i> devs want to leave out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess the only solution is to create and form a separate OpenCurrency
</I>&gt;<i> project that is independent of the OpenSim project (similar to RealXtend)
</I>&gt;<i> and just work independently of the Core Devs on an &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I stated previously, I'd be more than willing to help in this venture.
</I>&gt;<i>  It seems that Melanie already has some work/implementation that she has
</I>&gt;<i> already started, maybe we can start an OpenSource &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project and
</I>&gt;<i> build upon some of what Mel has already done, or work on building something
</I>&gt;<i> similar to what SL has done (using PayPal API's as a gateway, and using
</I>&gt;<i> Paypal to handle all the secure financial transactions).  This way the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenCurrency server simply holds the points/karma as just an item/object in
</I>&gt;<i> the asset server?  It would seem to make sense to just have a currency value
</I>&gt;<i> assigned to users.  If objects can be gifted between users (and not stolen)
</I>&gt;<i> then I can't imagine the problem with being unable to gift points between
</I>&gt;<i> users.  Some people like to act like the sky is falling, and attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> equate &quot;points=cash&quot; which they do not.  Many online games use a points
</I>&gt;<i> system, including Zynga, and SL.  A small handful of devs want to act like
</I>&gt;<i> the sky is falling anytime you mention anything about a points system, but
</I>&gt;<i> the code is still in the Alpha stages, and this would be the best time to
</I>&gt;<i> work on designing a module (from the ground up) so that OpenSim could be
</I>&gt;<i> made as a secure platform.  It's foolish to develop something without having
</I>&gt;<i> the vision to make it secure, and something that is expandable, and
</I>&gt;<i> something that can easily accept a virtual points/karma system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Games such as &quot;Mafia Wars&quot; (that use virtual points as part of the gaming
</I>&gt;<i> experience) have well over 16.5+ Million active users, with over 3.4 to 4
</I>&gt;<i> million active players each day.  It would only make sense to include a
</I>&gt;<i> points system as part of OpenSim, and doesn't make any sense at all to
</I>&gt;<i> ignore such a key element in an online gaming or online virtual platform.
</I>&gt;<i>  Some region/world operators may choose not to enable it, but it still
</I>&gt;<i> should be a part of core that could easily be enabled/disabled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If Core Devs don't want it to be a part of core, then we may just have to
</I>&gt;<i> start a separate OpenSource &quot;OpenCurrency&quot; project.  It may need to be a
</I>&gt;<i> separate module, similar to what RealXtend is doing, but I'm more than
</I>&gt;<i> willing to help with the effort in any way that I can.  (Website
</I>&gt;<i> development, Wiki documentation, technical writing, tutorials, alpha/beta
</I>&gt;<i> testing, vulnerability &amp; penetration testing, etc.)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; told NOT to refund the Lindens as they would resolve the &quot;glitch.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; After 24 hours and some very hostile people demanding their money back
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; decided to go ahead and send each of them the 10,000 Lindens they gave
