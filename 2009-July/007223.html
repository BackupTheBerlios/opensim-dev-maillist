<PRE>Hi Christophe and all,

I am also interested in this useful feature and experimented a
bit. I searched for the position in the OpenSim-Code, where the login and
the logout process (the first and the last client-server messages) takes
place. There I implemented an add-/ delete-method, which handles the
login/logout for users with &quot;guest&quot; as last name. The method adds/ deletes
this users to/from the userserver database.
The limitation of the guest users permissions is certainly still open. My
first idea was to achive this issue per group policy (through a
guest-group), but in my view, the group module in opensim is too
undeveloped, just now.
I would be grateful for collaboration and suggestions on how to solve this
issue.

Regards, Tobias

Hi, How could I develop and help for a feature:
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/features/issue.php?id=90">http://opensimulator.org/features/issue.php?id=90</A>
I'm interested by this feature, I've your git repo
(<A HREF="git://opensimulator.org/git/opensim">git://opensimulator.org/git/opensim</A>
&lt;<A HREF="git://opensimulator.org/git/opensim-test3">git://opensimulator.org/git/opensim-test3</A>&gt;) and your svn one...
but you're on a really big project where I should contribute...
Should you give me advises?
Do an other branch on gitorious should be an Idea but I don't think I
should do it alone.
I didn't found your architecture and name conventions and my low level
told me I should help but not let me the ability to understand and work
on it alone...

Please ff you want this feature answer me I'll try to help as much as I can.

rqe: I use MonoDevelop and didn't understand how to compile and run from
it (I haven't try a lot but I suppose there are Linux users in your
group if you use a git repo ^^)

Thanks : Christophe Narbonne
