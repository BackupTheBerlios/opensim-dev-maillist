<PRE>STUN is used by a client to establish it's routable IP address. in
other words, the address a peer would have to connect to in order to
have a chance at crossing the NATting firewall.

DynDNS can help with this too, but is used to do name resolution.

they're effectively used for different scenarios. DynDNS and STUN can
both be used by systems which are given dynamic IP addresses from
their ISPs. depending on the type of fabric you want to use, either
might be useful. if you're talking about software that starts up,
registers it's IP address with a service, that's STUN. if you want to
publish a DNS name and have it route to your NATting firewall even if
you're on the wrong end of a dynamic IP address, thats DynDNS.

for what it's worth, STUN considered to address a subset of the
problem of maintaining stateful application layer sessions across a
NATted firewall. RFC5389 describes the problem in a little more
detail, along with more generic solutions. (
<A HREF="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389</A> )

RFC5389 describes a series of techniques for UDP messages to
successfully traverse a firewall that are not found in DynDNS.
Ultimately, a good read of 5389 and practical experience with your
firewall will do you a load of good.
