Yes, you're probably right. I was referring to all the other threads 
that send things to the client. There's one that sends images, not sure 
if there's another that sends non-image assets. I'll have to revisit the 
code to find all those thread loops again...

Yes, it does very little. The main LLClientView thread spwans other 
threads like the texture sender. I'm not sure the texture sender (and 
others like it) are necessary or wanted. I'm not sure they aren't either 
:<i>-) But since you're bringing this issue up, I thought I'd bring these 
</I>up for discussion.

&gt;<i> It would almost make sense to have the child agent be a full thread

</I>&gt;<i> event.   That event could be a certain packet processing threshold is
</I>&gt;<i> reached..   or..   the terrain and the objects have been sent to the
</I>&gt;<i> client.
</I>
This dynamic behavior may become complicated to manage. It might be 
simpler/better to treat child agents in a special way from the very 
beginning? Or simply eliminate all other auxiliary threads except the 
main LLClientView thread?
