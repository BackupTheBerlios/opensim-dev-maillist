<PRE>Sacha:

That would be uber-cool if you could test the BUST notions and report back your opinion. It would allow a number of folks to feel more comfortable about these proposed changes.

Thank you kindly.

Charles

We will be pleased to test BUST without the fears to  get Busted...

Melanie:

I think the key here is 'evolution' and not 'revolution'. We have sufficient momentum and sufficient users with OpenSim that we need to go out of our way to provide and evolutionary path and that of necessity must include sufficient documentation to allow our users to use OpenSim with a reasonable effort.

As we evolve, whether we go away from the UGAIM to BUST or something else has yet to be determined, and it will be determined by the users as they adopt one or the other.

So, please figure out how to get two grids using BUST and report back on their progress. 

Given that, please figure out how to get a half-a-dozen early adopters to test this new logic.

By doing that, the 'evolution' will take care of itself and we will have a much better product.

Charles

</I>
Yes, you (Melanie) have mentioned 'new' protocols but afaik this is the first I've heard of this.  Changing OGS1 
protocols is a big upheaval and should be properly laid out and peer reviewed before work starts. not after or during. 
Going down the wrong path now will be expensive later on.

If you can point me towards existing documentation on this (if it's part of BUST) that would be appreciated.

Thankyou for writing the existing documentation on BUST.  I'm sure if the new technology is well received then we can 
deprecate and remove the old servers.

I also don't like the name 'BUST'.  As we've already *very extensively seen*, we should not assume a sense of humour on 
the part of others.  A compromise would be to change the server prompt.

</I>
Absolutely.  Asking for a general vote on progress is like proposing a vote on motherhood and apple pie.  We can only 
make meaningful votes on specific proposals.

I'm actually now confused on whether you're asking for a vote on eventually deprecating the old servers (but not before 
another vote) or on changing basic grid protocols.  I assume it is the former rather than the latter.
