<PRE>The OpenSim core team is currently evaluating a transition of the
opensim project from subversion to git.  This is not a new idea, many of
us on the Linux side have proposed this previously (many of us on the
Linux side are already using git via the git-svn bridge for our opensim
development).  The challenge has really been that the windows git story
was really poor.  But recently, that got a lot better.

I'm starting to put together some instructions on using git, including
some of the stardard workflow at <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Using_Git">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Using_Git</A>

The instructions are currently slightly core centric, but the repository
can also be cloned anonymously via the url
<A HREF="git://opensimulator.org/git/opensim-test.">git://opensimulator.org/git/opensim-test.</A>  This is a git snapshot of the
opensim repo as of yesterday.  It's designed for developers to play
around with, so expect it to be broken for the purposes of running
OpenSim, but useful for just figuring out things with git.

For the git mirror of svn trunk we set up viewgit already
(<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/viewgit">http://opensimulator.org/viewgit</A>).  I just added the opensim-test
repository there as well.

My hope is championing this is that it will make it easier to have
multiple people actively working on core features in opensim (as
conflict resolution is much easier with git), and make it easier for non
core people to contribute more advanced function, as work can be staged
and rebased externally.  (I've written up thoughts on this in the past
at
<A HREF="http://dague.net/2009/04/28/software-in-the-era-of-drive-by-contribution/">http://dague.net/2009/04/28/software-in-the-era-of-drive-by-contribution/</A>)

Comments as always are welcomed.  As with any potential change, there
will be bumps in the road, and some things will need to be relearned.
But I think it is worth it for many of the new abilities we'll get with git.

	-Sean

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
