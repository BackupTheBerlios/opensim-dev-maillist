</I>I've previously had a chance to work with a distributed version control 
system (Bitkeeper) on an Open Source project, and I felt at the time and 
still do that overall the benefits outweighed the down sides.

There can be a bit of a learning curve, new tools, new terminology and 
if used to it's full potential, new methodologies.  This can be 
daunting, and when the project I previously worked on transitioned from 
to Bitkeeper there was an initial slow down in productivity, but once 
everyone was familiar with the tools -- development accelerated to 
levels that weren't previously possible.

Git won't make all conflicts go away, but it can reduce them 
significantly.  Particularly around areas where file renames and moves 
are occurring.

+1 to Git.
