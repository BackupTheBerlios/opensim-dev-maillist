<PRE>After reading over the recent &quot;currency&quot; discussion/debate, I really do
think a separate module for possibly adding a &quot;values&quot; system to
OpenSim/RealXtend would be good.
For example maybe add 7 values (database values) for each character (user).
 This way a user can have a certain amount of health, stamina,
attack/defense pts, and energy points, as well as currency pts, and possibly
even a &quot;tokens&quot; type of system (similar to the &quot;Godfather&quot; tokens or points
used in Mob Wars or Mafia Wars).

Then have values for each object (attack/defense values).

This way an Jeep for example (or a Humvee) could be &quot;purchased&quot; in-world for
OS$10,000 and the Humvee would have an attack value of 28 and a defense
value of 23.  Also body armor or a bullet proof vest could be purchased
(with a defense value of 15, and attack value of 2).  Also a hand gun could
be purchased (with a defense value of 7 and an attack value of 5), or a
shotgun could be purchased (with a defense value of 10, and an attack value
of 7) or a machine gun could be purchased (with a defense value of 14 and an
attack value of 17).

This way better vehicles or weapons could be added later (by different
content developers) and it would allow for interactive game play.

For example if you hit or punched someone, their health would drop by 1
point.  If you had brass knuckles, and hit someone then your attack rating
would be 2 points (instead of 1), if you had a baseball bat and hit someone,
then it would decrease the other person's health (depending on their
attack/defense values, etc.)

Then there could be a &quot;hospital&quot; in-world, where you could visit the
hospital and pay OS$ dollars to replenish your health (or a time regen would
slowly replenish your health at 1 point per 5 minutes) so you would slowly
regain health over time.

Something like this would make online virtual game playing fun.  The ability
to buy/sell vehicles, aircraft, guns, bullet proof vests, body armor, and
various things would make the game interesting and fun.


        Mark

I would suggest the following:

1) Attack
2) Defense
3) Energy
4) Stamina
5) Currency (OS$ used for buying objects in-world)
6) Karma points (used like a &quot;Godfather&quot; type point or token system) for
special items

You could receive Karma points for finishing levels, or as rewards.
You could buy a Casino (to generate a certain amount of in-world currency
per hour) to be used for purchasing items in-world.

When you complete jobs, or levels you could receive 5 skill points (for
completely a level) and put those skill points towards increasing your
attack, defense or energy.

Jobs could require a certain amount of energy to complete each job (or
mission) and energy &amp; health would be replenished at 1 point every 5 minutes
(up to the maximum number that each character has).

So if a Character has 50 attack skills points, and 40 defense skills points,
and 100 energy skills points, then the user can do a variety of jobs (that
each require a certain number of energy points to complete) and could do a
certain number of &quot;hits&quot; or &quot;attacks&quot; (based on the amount of stamina points
the character has).

So each hit, or attack, or fight would require 1 stamina point.  If a
character has lots of stamina points (then it would be considered a
&quot;fighter&quot;), other characters may put their points towards energy (for doing
jobs), and others may put their points towards attack/defense (for fending
off attacks or hits, or being stronger in fights).

Also vehicles, and objects purchased in-world would help improve upon a
character's attack/defense points.
