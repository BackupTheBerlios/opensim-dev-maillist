<PRE>Hi!

Sorry, this is bit off topic, because this message doesn't just concern 
Open SIM development, it hopefully have also impact to Mono Project and SL.

We are looking for people with CLI/MSIL experience - or people who are 
motivated and quick learners - to join the project which goal is to 
write test suite for Mono project's metadata verifier. Also persons with 
less programming experience would be most helpful to join the project - 
there are lot's of things to do that don't require any programming skills!

Metadata verifier is critical component of Mono's sandbox 
(<A HREF="http://mono-project.com/MonoSandbox">http://mono-project.com/MonoSandbox</A>).When sandbox is completed it 
should allow &quot;execute arbitrary untrusted code and ensure that the 
untrusted code does not compromise the security of the system&quot;. It 
enables  to run safely scripts that are written by C#, VB.NET or other 
CLI compatible language in SL or Open SIM servers. For Mono, sandbox is 
one big requirement under their Moonlight project (Open source version 
of M$ Silverlight) (<A HREF="http://mono-project.com/MoonlightNotes">http://mono-project.com/MoonlightNotes</A>).

Currently we are doing very boring task called &quot;reading specifications&quot; 
- and same time we are collecting rules that are related to metadata 
verifier to very-big-ebil-list that we can use to generate test cases. 
When this is done, we hopefully can start writing test cases for 
metadata verifier. There is already working Mono metadata verifier that 
can analyze lower level logical format of metadata, but mostly due to 
lack of tests development has stopped to those tracks. Writing of test 
cases needs some lower level understanding of the runtime environment - 
that is where CLI/MSIL experience comes very handy.

To get more information about project:
- VISIT in our Wiki: 
<A HREF="http://www.xugumadison.org/csharp-sl/index.php?title=Main_Page">http://www.xugumadison.org/csharp-sl/index.php?title=Main_Page</A> (includes 
meeting minutes, project plan, etc)
- CONTACT to me in SL (Imaze Rhiano) or send mail for me
- JOIN our SL group &quot;C# Scripters&quot;.
- JOIN to our next meeting: 10:00 SLT (PDT)/ 17:00 GMT (NO DST!) / 19:00 
CET- 21th July 2009 - IRC #monodev - <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/IRC">http://mono-project.com/IRC</A>

If you want know about more Metadata verifier
- READ <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/MonoSandbox">http://mono-project.com/MonoSandbox</A>
- CHECK out mono's source code
- TALK with Kumpera in #monodev channel - <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/IRC">http://mono-project.com/IRC</A>

If you are not familiar with CLI/MSIL then you here are some good 
sources to start with:
- Kenny Kerr: Introduction to MSIL

- Standard ECMA-335 Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) 
(<A HREF="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm">http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm</A>)
- NET Common Language Runtime Unleashed (book preview) 
(<A HREF="http://books.google.fi/books?id=3059QRxPNQcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=.net+common+language+runtime&amp;ei=vhxjSvbBKqK2yATsxIDaDw">http://books.google.fi/books?id=3059QRxPNQcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=.net+common+language+runtime&amp;ei=vhxjSvbBKqK2yATsxIDaDw</A>)

Thank you!


(Also sorry about my baaaad engrish :P)
