<PRE>I think this illustrates extremely well why most of the devs don't want
to touch a money system. Making a proper monetary system means ensuring
that transactions happen, or do not, you can't get 7 copies of the same
transaction that then have to be unpicked by hand. I wouldn't be averse
to writing a money module if I had time (so, not this year), but I'd
want to do it properly so you can't get into this sort of mess...

</I>&gt;<i> very angry that I got their Lindens and they got nothing in return.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I communicated to them all and tried to explain the situation but most

</I>&gt;<i> Linden Lab tech support (after waiting nearly an hour on hold) and was
</I>&gt;<i> told NOT to refund the Lindens as they would resolve the &quot;glitch.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After 24 hours and some very hostile people demanding their money back I
</I>&gt;<i> decided to go ahead and send each of them the 10,000 Lindens they gave
</I>&gt;<i> me.  Almost a week later I logged in to find my account nearly 70,000
</I>&gt;<i> Lindens overdrawn!
