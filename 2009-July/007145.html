<PRE>I still experience an occasional hiccup with the Second Life money system so
i remain slightly wary of it.  Since money transactions remain a very buggy
and unreliable thing when it comes to virtual worlds, I've learned many new
ways to make financial gains without any in-world monetary implementations
at all.

At present I am gradually leasing out 25 regions from my own servers.  I
simply request payment be made via PayPal within the first 7 days of each
month and thus far I've not experienced any issues at all.  Everyone seems
very happy and I simplify things by only leasing out full regions rather
than trying to divide them up and lease out portions of regions.

While an in-world money system would at times be nice, and eventually will
come into being through optional plugins, I am quite happy managing my
virtual world properties through PayPal payments.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This reminds me of a situation I encountered in Second Life last

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of land I no longer needed.  I set the asking price at 10,000 Lindens.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right about that time Linden Lad encountered a problem and began a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rolling restart of their servers.  Somehow the money system got &quot;stuck&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and when someone bought my land it did not register with the Linden Lab
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; servers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The result was that, over the course of the next 20 minutes 7 people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;bought&quot; my land.  When the dust settled I had one actual owner of my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; land and 7 actual purchases.  As you might imagine, a lot of people were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very angry that I got their Lindens and they got nothing in return.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I communicated to them all and tried to explain the situation but most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; called me a liar since &quot;this never happened before.  I then contacted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Linden Lab tech support (after waiting nearly an hour on hold) and was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; told NOT to refund the Lindens as they would resolve the &quot;glitch.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After 24 hours and some very hostile people demanding their money back I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decided to go ahead and send each of them the 10,000 Lindens they gave
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me.  Almost a week later I logged in to find my account nearly 70,000
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lindens overdrawn!
