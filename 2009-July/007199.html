<PRE>I don't know enough Opensim Core and hidden implications of this proposal,
but I've been developing some extensions for my sims.

What you are proposing can be made nowadays using Plugins as it is a custom
behavior of one or several regions. You can use whatever &quot;storing&quot; system
for your data and define whatever vehicles you need with whatever custom
properties and apply the properties you want to your avatar.

Maybe I'm wrong but these custom applications are out of the scope of the
opensim core.

If you think as opensim as &quot;the apache for virtual worlds&quot;, well, apache
only serves plain text to a tcp/ip port, any other job is made by the custom
modules. I use to think like that: opensim provides the basic APIs, my job
is to use them.

&gt;<i> After reading over the recent &quot;currency&quot; discussion/debate, I really do
</I>&gt;<i> think a separate module for possibly adding a &quot;values&quot; system to
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim/RealXtend would be good.
</I>&gt;<i> For example maybe add 7 values (database values) for each character (user).
</I>&gt;<i>  This way a user can have a certain amount of health, stamina,
</I>&gt;<i> attack/defense pts, and energy points, as well as currency pts, and possibly
</I>&gt;<i> even a &quot;tokens&quot; type of system (similar to the &quot;Godfather&quot; tokens or points
</I>&gt;<i> used in Mob Wars or Mafia Wars).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then have values for each object (attack/defense values).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This way an Jeep for example (or a Humvee) could be &quot;purchased&quot; in-world
</I>&gt;<i> for OS$10,000 and the Humvee would have an attack value of 28 and a defense
</I>&gt;<i> value of 23.  Also body armor or a bullet proof vest could be purchased
</I>&gt;<i> (with a defense value of 15, and attack value of 2).  Also a hand gun could
</I>&gt;<i> be purchased (with a defense value of 7 and an attack value of 5), or a
</I>&gt;<i> shotgun could be purchased (with a defense value of 10, and an attack value
</I>&gt;<i> of 7) or a machine gun could be purchased (with a defense value of 14 and an
</I>&gt;<i> attack value of 17).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This way better vehicles or weapons could be added later (by different
</I>&gt;<i> content developers) and it would allow for interactive game play.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example if you hit or punched someone, their health would drop by 1
</I>&gt;<i> point.  If you had brass knuckles, and hit someone then your attack rating
</I>&gt;<i> would be 2 points (instead of 1), if you had a baseball bat and hit someone,
</I>&gt;<i> then it would decrease the other person's health (depending on their
</I>&gt;<i> attack/defense values, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then there could be a &quot;hospital&quot; in-world, where you could visit the
</I>&gt;<i> hospital and pay OS$ dollars to replenish your health (or a time regen would
</I>&gt;<i> slowly replenish your health at 1 point per 5 minutes) so you would slowly
</I>&gt;<i> regain health over time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Something like this would make online virtual game playing fun.  The
</I>&gt;<i> ability to buy/sell vehicles, aircraft, guns, bullet proof vests, body
</I>&gt;<i> armor, and various things would make the game interesting and fun.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Mark
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Attack
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Defense
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Energy
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Stamina
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Currency (OS$ used for buying objects in-world)
</I>&gt;<i> 6) Karma points (used like a &quot;Godfather&quot; type point or token system) for
</I>&gt;<i> special items
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could receive Karma points for finishing levels, or as rewards.
</I>&gt;<i> You could buy a Casino (to generate a certain amount of in-world currency
</I>&gt;<i> per hour) to be used for purchasing items in-world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When you complete jobs, or levels you could receive 5 skill points (for
</I>&gt;<i> completely a level) and put those skill points towards increasing your
</I>&gt;<i> attack, defense or energy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jobs could require a certain amount of energy to complete each job (or
</I>&gt;<i> mission) and energy &amp; health would be replenished at 1 point every 5 minutes
</I>&gt;<i> (up to the maximum number that each character has).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if a Character has 50 attack skills points, and 40 defense skills
</I>&gt;<i> points, and 100 energy skills points, then the user can do a variety of jobs
</I>&gt;<i> (that each require a certain number of energy points to complete) and could
</I>&gt;<i> do a certain number of &quot;hits&quot; or &quot;attacks&quot; (based on the amount of stamina
</I>&gt;<i> points the character has).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So each hit, or attack, or fight would require 1 stamina point.  If a
</I>&gt;<i> character has lots of stamina points (then it would be considered a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;fighter&quot;), other characters may put their points towards energy (for doing
</I>&gt;<i> jobs), and others may put their points towards attack/defense (for fending
</I>&gt;<i> off attacks or hits, or being stronger in fights).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also vehicles, and objects purchased in-world would help improve upon a
</I>&gt;<i> character's attack/defense points.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
