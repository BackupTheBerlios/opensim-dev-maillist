<PRE>Hey everyone

After fighting with things for a bit, I'm going to recommend bumping
the version of the gridcomms.

It turns out that the json serialization of the UUID type was changed
in libOMV revision r2588 to a plain string.
This leaves older regions expecting a 'uuid::' prefix (as was the
previous format) unable to decode UUIDs and return a UUID.Zero.

This will break Hypergrid and some types of region to region comms
between OpenSim revisions 10081 and 10082. Regions in versions 10082
cannot talk properly to regions 10081 and below.   If you try, some
regions will show, some won't, you'll have border crossing issues
sometimes and you'll get weird console messages.   For grids who want
a consistent experience, you will need to upgrade regions together so
organize the effort appropriately.

Unfortunately, there isn't really anything that we can do besides this
except roll back the LibOMV 0.7.0 commit and stay on an older version
of libOMV.  There isn't any way to programmatically change, without
forking OpenMetaverse.StructureData, what should go over the wire
serialization.   Additionally, on the receiving side, there's no way
to know what was a UUID and what was a string with UUID text in it's
contents so converting it there is also out of the question.

Additionally, any services that make use of the json serialization are
affected (json stats come to mind).

Be aware of these changes

Regards

Teravus
