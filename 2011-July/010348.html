Hmm, a quick glance at EventManager.OnMakeRootAgent. Looks like that 
gets triggert after a Agent already is present, so that would be after 
the agent already has gotten access. But i will have a look at it in 
more detail on the weekend.

But what i also noticed is, that the child agents which go through the 
access process also can be denied. What i still want to test is, if the 
child agents that are denied get listed as child or not. A child agent 
should in my mind always be listed, even if they dont have access. In 
that case checking access permisions for a simple child would anyway be 
unnecessary work for the sim. Or not?

Still, the easiest would probably be to handle the incomming agent as 
root from the start on instead of changing the child to root once they 
already have access. The advantage would be that any step taken from the 
first moment on could recognize what work is needed and what not. So for 
me the question to figure is, in which of the 1000 files does the entire 
login process to a region start... and how would it affect the rest if 
we handle incomming agents as root instead of a child which we change to 
root later on...
