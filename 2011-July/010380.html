<PRE>There is so much available for OpenSim that it is almost overwhelming. I
have taken the latest OpenSim and got it up and running fairly quickly (less
that an hour) and found some .OAR files and was able to load different ones
in to check them out. I am really impressed. I then discovered the DIVA/WIFI
build which is nice in that it has the user front end built in. So now I am
pondering which version to go with. I guess the DIVA/WIFI basically forces
you into getting updates from them. I dabbled briefly to get a web front end
working with OpenSim but was unsuccessful. So I have a few more questions:
I am thinking of running my own Standalone Grid since I have 3 or 4 servers
I can use but wanted to get recommendations on the pros and cons of
standalone vs. being interconnected - all input and opinions are welcomed.

Next, I need decide whether I should run the DIVA/WIFI version or go with
the standard OpenSim download. If I go with the OpenSim how easy is it to
setup to use MYSQL? Again,  all input and opinions are welcomed.

I have heard from a couple folks and read on some sites about using Unity3D.
Not sure that I want to spend any money on this venture since I doubt that
there is really any money to be made (lots of 3D sites out there). But I am
curious what others are doing and what people might have to say about
Unity3D.  Again,  all input and opinions are welcomed.

Still trying to figure out where the content goes and what format it is, I
guess as I read more I will learn more. Since I can't find anything under
the server folders I am assuming that the content is stored in the database?
So what is the main format of the content (other than the typical graphic
files like GIF, JPG, etc.)?

Is there any limitation on the number of regions one can one under a given
configuration (the DIVA/WIFI version built 4 regions)? Is it easy to add
regions? Can you load different .OAR files into regions?

Last question for this go around, the Avatar that is setup with either build
is a female and while using Imprudence to logon as recommended by many, I
can't change the avatar shape (it is locked and indicates I don't have
permission yet the land and everything indicates that I am the owner).

Take care...
