Bruce, as well as the prebuilt Diva distribution, which is a great 
way to get started quickly and make updates easier, you can also use 
the Diva Wifi front end separately with any OpenSim grid.  There is 
an add on to allow that for the current stable release of OpenSim at 
<A HREF="https://github.com/diva/d2/downloads">https://github.com/diva/d2/downloads</A> or it is possible to take the 
Wifi add-on elements and incorporate them into the latest 0.7.2 dev 
version.  That's what we do with our open Openvuie grid.  See 
<A HREF="http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002/wifi">http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002/wifi</A>

</I>

A few of us are looking at Unity3D with interest too.  A nice thought 
for the future might be some meld of OpenSim and Unity3D

&gt;<i>Still trying to figure out where the content goes and what format it is, I

</I>

All content is stored in the DB (usually MyQL) as assets, and these 
can then be referenced for in world (&quot;rezzed&quot;) content, and held in 
individual avatar's inventory.

OpenSim uses the basic 3D content that is available in Linden lab's 
Second Life which started out with very simple 3D primitives 
(&quot;prims&quot;).Originally only avatars were based on meshes.  Some 
procedurally generated objects (like trees) were also available. The 
idea being that the same viewers could be used as clients to view 
OpenSim worlds as was used by Linden labs for their own served 
virtual world.  Since this time, progressively richer 3D models and 
meshes have been added.

Prims - a number of simple 3D basic shapes parametrically amended via 
path cut, deformation, etc.

Scuplties - a simple 3D object defined by a number of 3D points as an 
offset from a central point.

Mesh - meshes defined by the Collada 3D fromat (in the latest beta 
test viewers only, but about to become mainstream in Second Life and OpenSim)

Textures/Images are normally uploaded as PNG, JPG or TGA.
