<PRE>Remembering back before OpenSim had a cache it was HD speed sensitive. As much can be gained by good tuning of the Flotsam cache. 
I have found a SSD on the viewer does help its performance.

Once it's started and the regions have loaded, OpenSim is mostly memory resident. One exeption is the local asset cache which may be frequently accessed when new users arrive in a region and assets are delivered to them (textures, etc.). This is often mitigated by each user's viewer cache (assuming they visit the region frequently). I suspect if you have a region with many unique textures and very many first time or infrequent visitors, you might see an improvement by having your asset cache reside on a high-speed storage device. Otherwise I'm not sure it would be of much benefit at all over lower cost mass-storage options.

Grid services and databases may benefit from higher speed storage if your user base is sufficiently large and active.

  I'm getting ready to build a box specifically to run bunch of HG OS regions. The box will likely have no other purpose. It's not going to be expensive... I'm basically going to pour my money into a nice quad core CPU and RAM. But, I wanted to know if anyone here has any experience running OS using a high speed drive such as Seagate's Cheetah or SSDs. I'm really interested to hear if anyone has any experience with SSDs as they seem to be the fastest in terms of retrieval and storage.

  My theory is that OS is read/write intensive. Would a regular 7200 RPM drive create a bottleneck? If so, would and SSD drive help?

  TYIA!
