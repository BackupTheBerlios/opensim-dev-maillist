<PRE>I've been seeing a lot of problems with avatar baking on both 0.6.9 and
0.7.1.  On 0.6.9 turning on http texture fetching helps enormously.
 However, it seems to do the opposite with 0.7.1, ensuring that avatars
never rezz for anyone else.  The problem seems to affect other areas where
textures are displayed - for example opening a previously uploaded texture
that is in the inventory to view it gives a 0x0 empty image, whereas opening
the same image with HTTP textures off works fine.  This is with any of the
series 1.3.x Imprudence viewers.  Problem is not there with Imprudence
1.4b1.  Can anyone else confirm this? (occurs with all 0.7.1 builds I've
tried, on both windows and linux)

Related, there seem to have been a lot of changes in the way that appearance
is processed from 0.6.9 to 0.7.1 resulting in much slower appearance of
avatars, and typically avatars almost always starting as a cloud until the
relevant client has download all wearables and attachments, rezzed them
fully, baked and uploaded.  The viewer doesn't seem to prioritize the avatar
textures so sometimes this baking can take minutes during which everyone
else sees you as a cloud.  I'm guessing that the changes were an attempt to
improve the reliability of appearance - if anyone can confirm what I'm
seeing I'd be grateful, and can anyone shed more light on the changes?

Thanks
Neil Canham
