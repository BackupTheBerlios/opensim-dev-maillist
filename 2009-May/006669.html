<PRE>At the request of dahlia, I am starting this thread to discuss Region
startup, I would 1st like to bring attention to the feature request that i
filed on this topic

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/features/issue.php?id=45">http://opensimulator.org/features/issue.php?id=45</A>

What is happening is for many minutes after the [Startup Complete] message
is displayed, startup is still going and not actually finished, if an avatar
logs in during this time it results in a hung viewer that never loads.  This
can be pretty frustrating if your debuging and testing all day because the
only way to really know when the sculpt retreival and decoding of sculpties
prior to the meshing of these assets can take a really long time, and just
as a note and for dahlias sake this is not a meshing issue, its unrelated to
the mesher itself other than its the process that occurs prior to the
meshing so meshing can be completed.  anyway this is not really the issue,
the issue is that the region is not actually started and we are making a
claim on the console that is has, I would be great if we could work
something out that the startup complete message and logins are disabled
until not only the full pre-meshing sculpty retreival / scripting and the
meshing itself are complete, because in reality until these all finish, the
sim is not actually started and ready, and if enough people log in during
this window it can result in scripting errors and simulator crashing in
addition to hung viewers.  Please lets discuss methods on how we can perhaps
correct this and make the opensimulator experience better.  Thanks
