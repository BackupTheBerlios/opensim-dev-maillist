<PRE>No, this is not talking about anything to death, Melanie. This is about writing down for others to read and understand at least *some* of what you are trying to accomplish.

This can be done via blogs, wiki paragraphs, FAQ, or other.

This feeling has been a long time coming, Melanie, and this is a plea for you to write down at least *some* of what you are doing so that there are clues for the early adopters to read and understand.

Charles

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] breaking OpenSim.ini changes

Well said. Trunk is supposed to be the developers' work area. If we 
can't use trunk as a work area anymore, maybe things should be in 
branches!
This is work in progress, and there will be breaking changes, and 
lots more. Documenting as we go it not an option, since we 
frequently have to go back and change things after the fact. Much 
easier to document when it's done than to keep remembering what is 
already on the wiki and where, and to update it whenever some small 
thing needs to be changed.
This is about code development, not about the general usability of 
trunk. Trunk is supposed to be broken, we have releases for people 
who expect things to JustWork(tm).

Now, let's get this work done and not talk it to death in committee.
