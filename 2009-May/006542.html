<PRE>&quot;Don't panic!&quot;

Here's what's going on. Melanie is doing massive coding in a  parallel 
set of projects in trunk, without touching [much] the existing code. 
Those projects are completely new code. Some of it are new servers; some 
of it are connectors between the simulator and the [new and old] 
services. Nothing is particularly unstable, because that new code 
doesn't run... that is, until I come in to the simulator code and start 
replacing the existing glue code (AssetCache/Local/OGS1/Hypergrid) with 
the new connectors, and add their new configuration variables to .ini.

What happened last weekend, and the reason why it went wobbly for a 
couple of days, is that I did that for the old AssetCache, which is now 
an IAssetService with those configurations that Nebadon already sent out 
several times.

I am *not* going to do the changes for the other services until four 
things happen:
(1) I finish writing documentation about this software architecture. 
Bear with me. Melanie is faster at coding than I am at writing this, but 
it's coming to life.
(2) We have a discussion here on the -dev mailing list about it, pros 
and cons, concerns, comments, wishes, etc.
(3) There is general agreement that this is AGoodThing(tm).
(4) If (3), we make a plan for transitioning the simulator to these new 
connectors in a way that is a smooth as possible.
