<PRE>It's ambitious, and I think most unlikely that mantis can be completely
cleared, but there are probably some juicy ones in there that could be
tackled that would benefit the project if they were resolved. It's an
ambitious call, but throw in a little reality and there is something
achievable in here and I think it's worth considering.

 

Consolidating efforts at present time, making a base to move forward
from that is a bit more clear cut and defined, and generally polishing
up what we have now sounds good idea to me, but then I admit I don't do
nearly as much dev for OpenSim trunk as many others on this list. 

 

I kinda like Stefan's crazy plan, so +1 from me.

I can agree with that, if everyone else agrees i have no problem with
it, I would just hate for anyone to think that we are locking things up
and they wont have our support.  And mostly i was more concerned with
trying to clear mantis, that seams a bit unrealistic, as a good portion
of fixing the mantis probably rely on us instituting many feature
requests.  It kind of goes against the whole premise of freezing up
feature requests.

Wise from experience, I would never propose anything as preposterous as
to tell any core dev to do anything.
 
But if a substantial part of core devs and the patching community think
it's a good idea and can be swayed to rally for it, I think we can see
some really extraordinary measures that would make us all look pretty
god damn good.

And hell, I stated it would be ambitious. Aim for the stars, hit the
treetops, you know.

Have you even looked at mantis??? there are 728 open tickets, chances
are if we clear mantis, we will have OpenSimulator 1.0.. I personally
don't see this as feasible, this is to me looks like us trying to
control what all the developers are doing, and I have to -1 this idea as
it would probably make most devs just stop working.

I do believe we're all feeling the advent of 0.7 - a milestone in any
open source project.
 
Here's a crazy idea for you; how about we agree to freeze feature set
and major architecture as of now, and concentrate on only:
 
* Finalizing the backend restructuring
* Clear mantis (hell, let's CLEAR mantis! how's that for ambitious?)
* Write unit tests
 
until the cows come home, and tag the cow homecoming rev as 0.7? Or,
say, 1st of aug happens, and we'll tag 0.6.7 then instead. ;)

I believe this kind of solidified 0.7 would give us all a breather, help
us recoup, and then we can all go back to fiddling with our various dev
projects again.
 
What you say?

Best regards,
Stefan Andersson
