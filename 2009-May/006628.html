No, there is only one revision connected to that _tag_, because tags should be considered static (by convention). 

 

When we say 'it's based on 9561' we mean, 'that was the trunk rev we chose to base the 0.6.5-rc on, and subsequent tags and branches'.


/trunk is a branch, off which we choose a candidate revision.

when we branch that off to /branches/0.6.5-rc1, that gets a new revision number.

subsequent work in 0.6.5-rc1 gets new, unique numbers, as does subsequent work in /trunk

the act of tagging the /tags/0.6.5-release creates a new and unique number for the 'tag' revision. (it's not a reference, it's a copy)

the act of renaming 0.6.5-rc1 to 0.6.5-post-fixes advances its revision number.

 

et c.

 

simply: the revision number is not a 'version number'.


Best regards,
Stefan Andersson

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] What is the difference between various releases

I understand what you're saying, but in that light, should the SVN releasenumbers stay 'static' for a given tag?
(Yes, I've read the mail about SVN version numbers).

I understand the 0.6.5-release is a tag, but I've already seen a lot of different SVN releasenumbers associated with that specific tag. Could it be there was a mistake in making the tag?
