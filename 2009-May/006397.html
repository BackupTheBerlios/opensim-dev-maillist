<PRE>I have started working on the Xenki viewer which is a web base viewer and I
can see wanting to support this.  Right now Xenki is based on XAML and XBAP.
I have been playing with Silverlight based web client as well but that is a
bigger effort but where I like to get long term.  But both of these I can
see getting images using a URL so I can use the browser's image caching and
simply texture management.  I suspect we can create URLs based on
<A HREF="http://www.assetserver.com/AvatarUUID/AssetUUID">http://www.assetserver.com/AvatarUUID/AssetUUID</A> or some kind of CAPS
concept, so the server can see if this avatar is logged in and has
permissions to retrieve that image.  But I can also see if we can move away
from UUID to file names then that opens up to using every image in the
internet not just images that are uploaded into the grid.

 

If we have something working let me know I would be happy to play with it.

It is my impression that adressing by uri/url has been a goal for the last
1.5 years or so.
 
I'd be interested in hearing if there's actually anybody _not_ wanting us to
work towards that.
 
The only issue that I can see would be in regards to SL compatibility. I
have started to poc an approach where guid-based adressing of resources is
considered a thing purely between the viewer and the content endpoint (aka
the region) - that the region acts as a 'proxy' translating guids to uris
and back as needed. So far the code is merely stubs, so I haven't got to the
point of proofing it, but I believe you all understand what I'm saying. Have
a look at what uses the fairly new ContainsReferences method on AssetBase to
see where I was going.

Best regards,
Stefan Andersson

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we do not consider SL restrictions for a second and look to the
</I>&gt;<i> future it would be nice to discuss the following which popped out from
</I>&gt;<i> dahlias idea of supporting loading textures from websites directly and
</I>&gt;<i> Stefans suggestion of using strings as ids in the standard format
</I>&gt;<i> thread:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is good to consider supporting identification of assets by
</I>&gt;<i> traditional urls. Some public asset servers could be www servers or
</I>&gt;<i> svn http servers. As all 3d modeling programs are refering to
</I>&gt;<i> aggregate assets using file paths, it would be easy to upload the
</I>&gt;<i> model to SVN http server and then using viewer pull out the model and
</I>&gt;<i> aggregate assets for viewing. This could be alternative asset
</I>&gt;<i> distribution model. it could work through region asset cache or
</I>&gt;<i> directly from viewer to the http server. This could be much more
</I>&gt;<i> scalable than the current model. I realize this is a threat to the
</I>&gt;<i> data consistency as models and aggregate assets are not saved to
</I>&gt;<i> relational database which could safeguard relations. It is also viable
</I>&gt;<i> only for completely public content but I assume considerable portion
</I>&gt;<i> of the vw content is likely to be freely distributable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would be in practice support for &quot;importing&quot; content from web on the
</I>fly.
