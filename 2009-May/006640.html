Ahhh! That explains the mystery. Sorry, it's hard to put all these 
historical pieces together, I only started looking at this last week 
with the switch to the new services architecture. I was under the 
impression that the old &quot;AssetCache&quot; used Framework/Cache.cs, but that 
is not so; it used a GlynnTucker cache! That makes a lot more sense.

Everything makes sense to me now, mystery explained. On the one hand, 
Melanie's switching from the GlynnTucker cache to Framework/Cache.cs 
made things work badly for the cache module (CoreAssetCache), because 
Framework/Cache.cs seems to have buglets. On the other hand, Melanie's 
getting rid of &quot;AssetCache&quot; altogether made fetching assets from the 
server work about 10 times faster. When we put together the new async 
mechanism for retrieving assets with the old GlynTucker cache things 
work really well, and that's what we're seeing :-)
