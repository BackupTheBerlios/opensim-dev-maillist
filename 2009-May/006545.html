<PRE>Melanie &amp; Diva,
I just want to say thank-you for all your hard work on the project, and also
thank-you for keeping us all updated with your most recent posts.

We've sent out several messages today to members of the OS community, I know
Dan sent out a message today as well (to OSHUG), and everyone has been
fairly warned to stay away from Trunk.

I'm going to wait another week or two till some of the &quot;dust settles&quot; so
that the core OS developers and the OS Alpha Testers are not getting sand
thrown in each other's face.  ;-)

I just want to thank-you for all your hard work, and thank-you for updating
us and letting us know exactly what is going on.

&gt;<i> The transplant is mostly done. See commit message for the things that
</I>&gt;<i> are borked. Also note, I changed the config var you had called &quot;Modules&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;ServiceConnectors&quot;, you probably need to change your local .ini.
</I>&gt;<i> Talk to you tomorrow.&gt;
</I>
I'm going to wait at least a week or two, just to give the core developers
some &quot;breathing room&quot;, but Melanie please just post an &quot;All Clear&quot; message
when it's safe for the Alpha Testers to come out again and begin tinkering
again.

Melanie, if there is anything that I can do to help you (or others) with
documentation, WIKI page updating, or testing... please let me know.  Also,
thank-you again for your recent posts and the commit message.  Thank-you for
the recent warning, and if anything is temporarily &quot;borked&quot; I'm sure we'll
slowly find it, and work on helping to find all the bugs and things that
temporarily broke.  ;-)

Again, I just want to say thank you (and thank all the other core OS &amp;
realXtend core developers) for all that you do for the OS Project and OS
Community.

                       Thank-you,

                           Mark

&gt;<i> Everyone --
</I>&gt;<i> Just a warning to please stay away from head, starting in r9562, for the

</I>&gt;<i> things. We started replacing the services to the new service model that

</I>&gt;<i> starters, there are new configuration variables in OpenSim.ini that you
