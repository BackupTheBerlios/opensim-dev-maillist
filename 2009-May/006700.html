<PRE>It pains me to disagree with you, Nebadon, but when I look at the summary page on our Mantis this morning, I see 247 open Mantis issues. This actually is an admirable goal and I would think clearing as many of these as possible over the next month is an admirable goal. Like all goals, we always can declare success when it &quot;feels&quot; right and thats my wriggle room.

Charles

I can agree with that, if everyone else agrees i have no problem with it, I would just hate for anyone to think that we are locking things up and they wont have our support.  And mostly i was more concerned with trying to clear mantis, that seams a bit unrealistic, as a good portion of fixing the mantis probably rely on us instituting many feature requests.  It kind of goes against the whole premise of freezing up feature requests.

Wise from experience, I would never propose anything as preposterous as to tell any core dev to do anything.
 
But if a substantial part of core devs and the patching community think it's a good idea and can be swayed to rally for it, I think we can see some really extraordinary measures that would make us all look pretty god damn good.

And hell, I stated it would be ambitious. Aim for the stars, hit the treetops, you know.

Have you even looked at mantis??? there are 728 open tickets, chances are if we clear mantis, we will have OpenSimulator 1.0.. I personally don't see this as feasible, this is to me looks like us trying to control what all the developers are doing, and I have to -1 this idea as it would probably make most devs just stop working.

I do believe we're all feeling the advent of 0.7 - a milestone in any open source project.
 
Here's a crazy idea for you; how about we agree to freeze feature set and major architecture as of now, and concentrate on only:
 
* Finalizing the backend restructuring
* Clear mantis (hell, let's CLEAR mantis! how's that for ambitious?)
* Write unit tests
 
until the cows come home, and tag the cow homecoming rev as 0.7? Or, say, 1st of aug happens, and we'll tag 0.6.7 then instead. ;)

I believe this kind of solidified 0.7 would give us all a breather, help us recoup, and then we can all go back to fiddling with our various dev projects again.
 
What you say?

Best regards,
Stefan Andersson
