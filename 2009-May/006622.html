</I>

0.6.5-post-fixes is a branch.  0.6.5-release is a tag.  So what does
that mean in practical terms?  The 0.6.5-release tag is a static
point-in-time snapshot of part of the code repository.  It's a release
version, what people will (should) be referring to when they say &quot;I'm
running OpenSim version 0.6.5&quot;.  But what if someone uncovered a bug
in 0.6.5 that caused some big issue?  A patch could be applied to the
0.6.5-post-fixes branch and 0.6.5.1-release (or 0.6.5a-release or
whatever) could be tagged.
