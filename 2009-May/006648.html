<PRE>Imaze, this is awesome! Thank you so much for such extensive testing and 
for doing the extra cache module implementation. This is really valuable.

If there are no objections from fellow committers, I will be more than 
happy to take an improved version of your code and add it to OpenSim as 
a 3rd alternative cache module that people can test out there in the wild.

Technically, your code needs thread-safety, that's all. Procedurally, it 
also needs a license on top. If you want to give your code to the 
OpenSim project, it needs the OpenSim license text. Otherwise, the cache 
itself (CnmHashGenerationCache) needs to be added as a 3rd party dll, 
and only the module would be 100% OpenSim. In any case, if you want to 
do this, whichever way you want to do it, please do it via a patch 
submitted in mantis, so we can have a record.

As for the more substantial contribution of the Cenome DB, I'll leave 
that to the people here who know more about DBs than I do.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here are my findings:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. CoreAssetCache's CacheBuckets configuration is not working properly. 
</I>&gt;<i> Cache's size is limited to 1024 buckets, because of bug or by design. So 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;default&quot; configuration value 32768 - didn't never happen.
</I>&gt;<i>     See:  private void SetSize(int newSize) in Cache.cs
</I>&gt;<i>              lock (m_Index)
</I>&gt;<i>             {
</I>&gt;<i>                 if (Count &lt;= Size)
</I>&gt;<i>                     return;
</I>&gt;<i>                 .....
</I>&gt;<i>              }
</I>&gt;<i>     During initialization phase, Count is 0 - so initial size value 1024 
</I>&gt;<i> is used. (And Count never can't grow up bigger than Size)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. GlynnTucker cache is basically Hashtable that contains all assets  
</I>&gt;<i> they are never removed from cache unless assets is exlusively removed by 
</I>&gt;<i> calling Expire method. It definately can provide huge performance impact 
</I>&gt;<i> for short time - but eventually your server is going to run out of  memory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. To evaluate different cache's performance I first tried to do some 
</I>&gt;<i> testing in stand alone SIM. Unfortunately single client, just didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> provide enough caching to really to measure performance, so I adopted 
</I>&gt;<i> different strategy. I did write simple Window$ console application with 
</I>&gt;<i> 4 different test cases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Test Case 1 &quot;EnumerateAllTest&quot;: Just add assets to cache by predefined 
</I>&gt;<i> order and then try to get them from cache in same order. (Basically 
</I>&gt;<i> caches were pretty much guranteed to forgot first few thousands assets.)
</I>&gt;<i> Test Case 2 &quot;GetRandom&quot;:  Try to get random asset from cache, and if 
</I>&gt;<i> asset is not found, add it to there.
</I>&gt;<i> Test Case 3 &quot;GetRandomMoreFrequentTest&quot;: Try to get random asset from 
</I>&gt;<i> cache, and if asset is not found, add it to there. However, this time 
</I>&gt;<i> there 1000 assets that are more likely asked than other assets (80% chance).
</I>&gt;<i> Test Case 4 &quot;GetRandomMoreFrequentWithExpireTest&quot;: Same as Test Case 3 - 
</I>&gt;<i> except that there is 25% chance to remove (expire) random assets from 
</I>&gt;<i> cache for each item retrieve iteration. Remove assets didn't actually 
</I>&gt;<i> need to be in cache.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  From these test cases, case 4 is maybe most realistic. Assets are 
</I>&gt;<i> requested randomly, but some of assets are requested more often. And 
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes assets are also expired explicitely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Test program did measure used time for each test case and cache hit rate 
</I>&gt;<i> (how frequently cache actually did return requested assets). I also did 
</I>&gt;<i> write two additional caches - Cenome Assets Cache (this is very basic 
</I>&gt;<i> memory cache coming from commercial database project that I am currently 
</I>&gt;<i> working on) and simple Dictionary based cache (to see difference between 
</I>&gt;<i> real caches and maximal possible performance). There was 100 000 
</I>&gt;<i> randomly generated &quot;assets&quot; with data length between 393 170 and 10 
</I>&gt;<i> bytes - total asset size 7 361 310 300 bytes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here are performance results:

</I>&gt;<i> 95.1%                83.3%
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see, CoreAssetCache is 15-20 times slower than more optimal 
</I>&gt;<i> solutions. And GlynnTucker assets cache hit rate is optimal - because it 
</I>&gt;<i> is storing all assets - and never forget them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. To find out why, CoreAssetsCache's performance is so poor compared to 
</I>&gt;<i> other caches, I did use JetBrain's dotTrace profiler. For profiling, I 
</I>&gt;<i> did lower assets count to 10000 and reduced iterations to lower 
</I>&gt;<i> (profiling is taking lot's of time) - so profiling measurements are not 
</I>&gt;<i> directly comparable with performance measurements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Major cause for CoreAssetsCache bad performance was 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;OpenSim.Framework.Cache.Store(String, Object, Type, Object [])&quot; methods 
</I>&gt;<i> line &quot;if (m_Index.Contains(new CacheItemBase(index)))&quot;. About 75% of 
</I>&gt;<i> time in Test Case 4 was used in this line. m_index is 
</I>&gt;<i> List&lt;CacheItemBase&gt; object. Contains call is basically linear search 
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm - instead of Contains method, BinarySearch should have been used.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thing that CoreAssetsCache class might be salvageable, but it really 
</I>&gt;<i> need some serious refactoring - like why there is two collection of keys 
</I>&gt;<i> m_Index and m_Loopup? It might be easier to either implement new cache 
</I>&gt;<i> class or maybe use CenomeCache as base of new implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. There is &quot;some&quot; weirdness in other parts of code:
</I>&gt;<i> - Cache class is also used directly in FriendsModule and 
</I>&gt;<i> LandManagementModule
</I>&gt;<i> - There is interface called: IAssetCache that is used in several places 
</I>&gt;<i> and modules, however just one Test class is implementing interface 
</I>&gt;<i> (TestAssetCache) (CoreAssetsCache, GlynnTuckerAssetCache and 
</I>&gt;<i> CenomeAssetsCache are implementing IImprovedAssetCache interface)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can (hopefully) download test program from 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://imazer.x10hosting.com/CacheTesting.zip">http://imazer.x10hosting.com/CacheTesting.zip</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Please note CenomeAssetCache is not ready for production - it is missing 
</I>&gt;<i> thread safety. (And I don't have update rights to Open SIM's version 
</I>&gt;<i> control system.)
</I>&gt;<i> This was first day when I took serious look to Open SIMs code - so I 
</I>&gt;<i> might be wrong several things here...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Imaze Rhiano
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS: It is possible that I could contribute licence to Cenome database 
</I>&gt;<i> for Open SIM project. Database is designed to store BLOB like objects 
</I>&gt;<i> with full transaction and threading support to single file. However - 
</I>&gt;<i> database is closed source and still under development. If closed source 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation is not acceptable - then alternative is B-tree variant 
</I>&gt;<i> implemation that I might be able to release to open source.
