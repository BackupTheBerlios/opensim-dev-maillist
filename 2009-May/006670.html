<PRE>I asked Nebadon to post this to the list to generate discussion. It's not
clear to me when the appropriate time would be to allow logins to a region.
Meshing and script loading are not confined to startup, they can happen at
any time when a region is running and prims and scripts are rezzed or
edited. It would seem that something in the scene would know the appropriate
time, but many of the processes related to scene loading are asynchronous
such as sculpt meshing, which is (currently) dependent on asset deliveries.
Could we list some of the observations surrounding this issue? What happens
when people log in before the region is fully loaded? Can these problems be
mitigated, or should logins and region entry be denied until some
pre-programmed decision can be made? Are there current safeguards in place
now that may have been rendered ineffective by past code revisions?
