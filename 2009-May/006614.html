<PRE>Justin,

Thank-you.

&gt;<i> First, I'll join Sean in thanking you for doing some work here, Mark.  I
</I>think &gt; that it can be a thankless task but any reversal of entropy is good.

No problem, thank-you for taking the time to say thank-you.  Documentation
is never fun... but it needs to be done.  ;-)

&gt;<i> In general, if I were you I'd concentrate on curating pages more than
</I>cleaning
&gt;<i> them up.
</I>
I slightly disagree.  I personally believe that the first task is to comb
through the current WIKI and figure out what we have, so we have an idea of
what still needs to be done.  I've found instances of duplicate pages, and
there is no reason for us to &quot;duplicate&quot; our efforts.  I believe the first
step, is organizing and combing through what pages we already have first,
cleaning things up a bit, and doing a bit of updating (and spell checking)
as I go.  Tagging all the pages properly (with page tags for pages that need
examples or need a bit of updated content, or need clarification, or simply
tag the &quot;proposal&quot; pages with the &quot;proposal&quot; tag).

Once all the WIKI pages are properly tagged (and &quot;cleaned up&quot;)  and
navigation links have all been added, it makes finding things a bit easier
for new users.  At the same time, it makes figuring out which existing pages
that we already have need to be updated, and makes finding pages that need
clarification (or need to be updated with examples) quite a bit easier as
well (as I simply just add the &quot;ToDo&quot; category tag.  All those pages I have
added to the &quot;Todo&quot; category just need to be reviewed, or may need a bit of
updated content, or some additional examples.

This way ANYONE wishing to help update WIKI content can easily just grab one
of those pages from the &quot;todo&quot; category, and begin working on updating
content.

Once the WIKI has been completely cleaned up (and all the navigation links
have been added), I've also been adding a &quot;See Also&quot; heading to all the
updated pages (with similarly related subject material).  This will make it
much easier for new users to find what they are looking for, and to navigate
the WIKI.  I've been adding key words, and adding titles to many of the
pages, so they show up better when using the WIKI search function.

Once I'm done with all the current stuff that we have, (and I've been taking
notes as I go, as to what areas need work) then later I can always go back
and add content to those areas/pages.  Then eventually once that is
completed, then I'll work on adding video tutorials and screencasts, but
that could easily be after Christmas before I even get that far.  ;-)

I want to do normal text tutorials first, and then later I'll add screencast
links (to the WIKI media section).

&gt;<i>I think that making them easily findable in the first place will make them
</I>more
&gt;<i> likely over time to be either cleaned up by other people over time or
</I>&gt;<i> disposed.
</I>
I agree that navigation is probably most important at this point, but I've
found that it's easiest to just tag pages as I'm updating the navigation.

If we all just sit and wait patiently for someone else to do it, then
usually it simply just doesn't get done.  By at least taking the initiative
to tag all the pages, at least it'll make it easier for others to see what
still needs to be done.  So I'm just taking the time now and going page by
page adding navigation links and quickly reviewing each page (for spelling
errors, etc.) and I quickly look over the content as well (for portions that
may need better examples, etc.) and properly tag all the pages that need
additional examples, or updated content.  This way others can easily check
the &quot;todo&quot; category, and see the tagged pages (and begin working on
reviewing and updating those pages).

It's a fairly daunting task to skim through everything once, I'd really hate
to have to do it twice.  No reason to do the same work twice.  So it seems
much easier to just go through page by page and do everything at once (tags,
navigation links, and &quot;See Also&quot; headings), and just slowly tackle things
page by page.  That way I just scratch those pages off my list.

At least this way I know what we have, and have a good idea of what still
needs to be done (and what pages need work), and as I find pages that seem
to be &quot;lost&quot; or &quot;hidden&quot; pages (no tags or no links) or find duplicate
pages.  Then at least I can tag those pages that need to be merged, or tag
the obsolete pages with notes for deletion (add the &quot;todelete&quot; tag).

This way later we can go back and merge the content on those duplicate
pages, and delete any unnecessary (old or outdated) pages.

Ok, enough chat.  Back to work.

I'll slowly post a list of pages here that may need some work/help from the
actual developers, because certain pages (those pertaining to a list of
commands or functions, status pages, etc.)  So at least the developers can
quickly glance at them, and update any content that they are familiar with
(or pages that may fall within their &quot;area of interest&quot; in the project).

Any remaining pages, I may come back in a month or so and ask for some
specific help/details, but I have to say some of the pages that Diva has
done, and some of the other developers really are great pages.

I seen some very nice recently added pages with very good examples, good
flow charts, very easy to read, very easy to follow, very easy to
understand, etc.  So I just want to thank the developers for their hard work
with helping to maintain documentation.  The recent &quot;proposal&quot; pages from
Diva/Melanie looked great!  So thank-you ALL for your hard work.

                 Thanks,

                   Mark

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ok, I've been working (as much as I possibly can) on creating pages,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; improving navigation links, and improving the current WIKI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; documentation, but there are quite a few pages that still need updating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (and I'm clueless as to what information should go on a few of these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pages).  I've added some pages, and some pages are a bit out of date
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (and need updated content), so I really need some help from the core
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developers on updating each of these following pages:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Sim_Throttles">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Sim_Throttles</A>   -  What is this page?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  What is the name &quot;Sim_Throttles&quot;, and where did it come from?  Is there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an actual event or function called &quot;Sim_Throttles&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;OpenSim_Throttles&quot;?  This page needs some updating from one of the core
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developers familiar with this, also should the name be changed from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Sim_Throttles&quot; to &quot;OpenSim_Throttles&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This relates to the code which controls the flow of data from the server to
</I>&gt;<i> the client.  It corresponds to the
</I>&gt;<i> information you'll see in the Linden Lab Second Life client stats (texture
</I>&gt;<i> data, object data, etc.).  Sim throttles is a
</I>&gt;<i> better name than OpenSim Throttles, though perhaps something like Client
</I>&gt;<i> Data Throttles is even better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also the following GridServer pages need work:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/GridServer">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/GridServer</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/GridServer/ClientDocs">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/GridServer/ClientDocs</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/GridServer/ClientDocs">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/GridServer/ClientDocs</A>          -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  GridServer Client Documentation Page
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/GridServer/DeveloperDocs">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/GridServer/DeveloperDocs</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/GridServer/ClientDocs">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/GridServer/ClientDocs</A>&gt;    -  GridServer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Developer Documentation Page
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what this is.  Some of the stuff it talks about (e.g. fetching
</I>&gt;<i> assets from various urls) has not been
</I>&gt;<i> implemented, so I don't know if it's old or new.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general, if I were you I'd concentrate on curating pages more than
</I>&gt;<i> cleaning them up.  I think that making them easily
</I>&gt;<i> findable in the first place will make them more likely over time to be
</I>&gt;<i> either cleaned up by other people over time or
</I>&gt;<i> disposed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also where can I find out the current LSL and OSSL &quot;Types Status&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Events Status&quot;?  Where does this information come from?  Mantis?   I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trying to figure out how to update those pages, but I'm just not sure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where the &quot;Type Status&quot; and &quot;Event Status&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information/numbers/statistics/completion stats comes from.  Please help
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me find this information, and update the pages accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've updated the navigation on these pages, but please review the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content on all of these pages to see if the content needs to be updated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as well.  I believe all the OpenSim &quot;Current Status&quot; pages need to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reviewed and updated accordingly as well:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/LSL_Status">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/LSL_Status</A>                  - LSL Status
</I>&gt;<i> Page
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/LSL_Status/Types">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/LSL_Status/Types</A>        - LSL Types Status
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Page
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/LSL_Status/Events">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/LSL_Status/Events</A>       - LSL Events
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Status Page

</I>&gt;<i> Page
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think much of this information stems from the days when Alondria and
</I>&gt;<i> CharlieO were working on that area (neither are
</I>&gt;<i> still active), though I'm sure people have updated these lists since then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I imagine that the data itself came chiefly from direct testing, ckrinke's
</I>&gt;<i> paper OpenSim notebook and code inspection
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. OpenSim/Region/ScriptEngine/Shared/Api/LSL_Api.cs) and comparisons
</I>&gt;<i> with lsl wiki pages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please give me some feedback, and/or update the content on the WIKI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pages listed above (or if you are not comfortable with updating the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WIKI, please just send me the correct text that should be posted on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WIKI page in an E-mail off-list, and I'll copy and paste the text to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WIKI page, and update any necessary formatting, grammatical corrections,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc).  I just need some updated content for these WIKI pages.  Thank-you!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                      Mark
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; P.S.  I'm still currently working on the OSSL pages, so please give me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another hour or two to finish up all the OSSL template pages before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; adding any content or updating the OSSL pages.  Thanks!
