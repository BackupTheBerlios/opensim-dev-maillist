</I>&gt;<i> been some interesting stuff done via scripting on the Linden grid but I
</I>&gt;<i> think there's also a lot of potential for the server-side approach (because
</I>&gt;<i> of the advantages outlined previously).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is one quite new example out there btw, which originally came from
</I>&gt;<i> the idea of thinking how we could 'eat our own dogfood' in opensim
</I>&gt;<i> development .. visualizing the state of software projects as virtual worlds,
</I>&gt;<i> to facilitate interdeveloper communications etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was developed against the Naali viewer codebase data, as an Opensim
</I>&gt;<i> region module, but is general enough to work against any software project
</I>&gt;<i> basically. The code is in <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/rexprojectspace/">http://code.google.com/p/rexprojectspace/</A> . It
</I>&gt;<i> creates a quite rich scene on the server entirely from the code in the
</I>&gt;<i> region module, using data it fetches from various services with http.
</I>&gt;<i> There's a downloadable video on the project site,
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/rexprojectspace/downloads/detail?name=rex_beta5.m4v..">http://code.google.com/p/rexprojectspace/downloads/detail?name=rex_beta5.m4v..</A> demonstrates all these features:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It pulls information about the code itself, mainly the module / directory
</I>&gt;<i> structure, from the version control (on github in this case). And shows
</I>&gt;<i> commit information, the latest commit msg to each dir. And has an object
</I>&gt;<i> representing each dev, placed where the previous commit from that dev came.
</I>&gt;<i> And shows bugs as a kind of flying bugs in the air, it gets that info from
</I>&gt;<i> the tracker we have at google code .. unassigned bugs have different colour.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally it polls a buildbot to show build/test status -- if tests
</I>&gt;<i> fail, the tree that shows the commits starts burning .. when tests again
</I>&gt;<i> succeed, there is rain, and the tree stops burning :) And if someone makes a
</I>&gt;<i> new branch to git, new branch grows to the tree. And you can click on a
</I>&gt;<i> commit in the tree to open the info about that commit in a webbrowser (the
</I>&gt;<i> github commit web view).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Markus made it as a his diploma thesis work, after found my writeup of the
</I>&gt;<i> idea in a wiki, and the thesis is finished now .. the writeup is in Finnish
</I>&gt;<i> though. I think we should write at least a short English article about it
</I>&gt;<i> too, perhaps have time for that in January or so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Plan is to set it somewhere to run and to actual use, and perhaps opensim
</I>&gt;<i> can adopt it for opensim code too .. and run it on osgrid somewhere :) . So
</I>&gt;<i> far I've been just running it locally sometimes, but am looking forward to
</I>&gt;<i> having it always on as a kind of a painting at our studio, so can easily see
</I>&gt;<i> the status in a nice way :) The visuals etc. are not the greatest, plan is
</I>&gt;<i> to improve, but it works and is in some way complete .. as a first step, I
</I>&gt;<i> hope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps also works as an example for the original poster (Richard
</I>&gt;<i> Hackathorn) for how to create a scene from external data in a region module.
</I>&gt;<i> It uses modrex 'cause it uses meshes, but the vanilla opensim API to create
</I>&gt;<i> new objects and assets and to place them etc. It is written in Python, using
</I>&gt;<i> the IronPython Opensim region module loader Erno wrote a while ago, but the
</I>&gt;<i> .net API of the Opensim objects is identical with c# usage. Py region
</I>&gt;<i> modules are nicer to dev 'cause you don't have to restart the simulator
</I>&gt;<i> while devving your module (I think MRMs have this advantage too?).  The py
</I>&gt;<i> opensim loader is nowadays hosted by Melanie in some semi official opensim
</I>&gt;<i> addons repo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Markus was quite happy to develop the module, actually said that didn't
</I>&gt;<i> encounter any bugs. He learned using Blender to model the tree and the
</I>&gt;<i> leaves etc. for this project too from scratch, and didn't know anything
</I>&gt;<i> about SL or Opensim or reX before this, so quite an achievement I'd say :)
