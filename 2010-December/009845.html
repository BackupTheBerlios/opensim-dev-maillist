<PRE>?I prefer the MySQL ini approach and taking the informative aspect to a Wiki page. 
Helping nOObs improved dramatically after OSG started their download site long ago.

There are just too many scattered about these days to do any tuning without residual typo or remove problems.
I will soon change my instances to only allow 1, without comments, ala D2.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Refactoring of defaults between OpenSimDefaults.ini and OpenSim.ini.example

I don't know if it's helpful to have a very non-technical user perspective, but as someone quite new to OpenSim, I actually found it reassuring that all the settings I MIGHT want to change were all in one place.  As I have learned more and gotten more comfortable with how the system works, I've then gone back and played with additional settings in the OpenSim.ini file. 

If it improves something technically then by all means change it, but from my perspective, it's actually a good thing to have a single place to look for where I might have goofed up a setting, or where I might change the functionality of my sims.  Even the settings I have no intention of messing with now, it's good to know they are there and that I COULD change them down the road if I want to.   It's pretty educational for us n00bs.  =)

Sincerely,

- Chris/Fleep

  Hi,

  the startup elements are frequently altered, as many people running
  small grids want limits like SL to make the economic model work.

  Same for the script crossing/binaries ones, grids turn them on, HG
  and standalones turn them off.

  Wind adn Trees, i'm with you there, they're not really used a lot,
  although supposedly sailors use the wind module.

  The LindenUDP settings, ODE settings and script engine settings have
  already been stripped down, maybe they need another looking at. I
  agree on LightShare.

  Economy is important, as most people want to be able to use the sell
  mechanism to transfer object and land owenrship, but on legal advice
  it is off by default. Pretty much everyone needs it.

  &gt; I wonder if some of the following items which I assume would rarely
  &gt; be changed by most users could be shifted also form
  &gt; OpenSim.ini.example to OpenSimDefaults.ini?  Do the core devs have a
  &gt; view on this to get a good split ahead of a 0.7.1 release?
  &gt;
  &gt; [Startup] some elements like meshing, physics, NonPhysicalPrimMax,
  &gt; PhysicalPrimMax, AllowScriptCrossing, TrustBinaries, various
  &gt; persistence related settings, DefaultScriptEngine, etc.  Probably
  &gt; quite a few there, leaving just the ones m,ost likely to be altered
  &gt; by non-experts.
  &gt;
  &gt; [Wind]
  &gt;
  &gt; [Trees]
  &gt;
  &gt; [ClientStack.LindenUDP]
  &gt;
  &gt; [ODEPhysicsSettings]
  &gt;
  &gt; [Economy]
  &gt;
  &gt; [XEngine] some options - leaving the AllowOSFunctions,
  &gt; AllowLightShareFunctions and OSFunctionThreatLevel in
  &gt; OpenSim.ini.example perhaps
  &gt;
  &gt; Conversley, maybe [LightShare]section should be moved from
  &gt; OpenSimDefaults.ini to OpenSim.example.ini (espec if
  &gt; AllowLightShareFunctions remains in OpenSim.ini.example as both will
  &gt; be required to make that functionality work I think.
