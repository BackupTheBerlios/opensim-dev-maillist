<PRE>We understand that there is incompatibility between the old HG 1.0 
and the more secure HG1.5.

As I understand it there was a change in some data base entries from 
&quot;interface 6 to interface 7&quot; which also meant that HG 1.5 i6 versions 
and before were incompatible with HG i7 and later.  At least it was 
observed that HG 1.5 i7 girds could interwork, and those could not 
work with HG 1.5 i6 ones. Is that correct Diva, or is that just the 
assumption that was made by some seeking to diagnose HG jump issues?

But now in testing recent versions with recent config changes for HG, 
there may be further incompatibility with previous HG 1.5 i7 grids, 
or it could be that they are just not yet properly configured.  It 
would be helpful if Diva could let us know if an incompatib8klity to 
earlier HG1.5 i7 grids is known, =and what release version in 0.7.1 
dev master is the cut off point to have as a minimum upgrade level to 
be compatible again.  If there is an incompatibility, it cold be 
useful to have a way to refer to this new partition of the hypergrid 
compatible grids.

I am happy to continue testing if anyone wants to check out what is 
happening, or to try to identify the issues in recent versions of 
OSGrid with lack of HG jump capability. Some of the testing being 
done, and the grids known to work under the new versions and that can 
be used to test are listed at <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=5259">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=5259</A>

Grids that are known to work (via a chatted link) two way when on 
latest 0.7.1 dev master are on our Openvue grid, and a test region 
that Diva set up at UCI...
