Boris R. at the ENNE labs in Paris (<A HREF="http://ener.ensad.fr/partenariat-realxtend/">http://ener.ensad.fr/partenariat-realxtend/</A>) did not only play, but has made serious work using MakeHuman during the past half a year or so to make new avatars. I don't know if there's more info about his work anywhere yet, but the blend files should be available soon (I need them myself too, but don't know yet where they are :) 

He made a low-poly version of the base mesh, and iirc MH team itself has been doing that recently too. Then used Blender to apply some motion captured animation sets they did with a company there in France.

These are coming out as free to use / creative commons stuff, new reX default AVs, but you can use them in SL or Sirikata or whereever else too (can export as Collada from Blender hopefully, that's why I need to test the blends, 'cause WebNaali uses the same GLGE engine as Sirikata's web client and we use Collada to bring models there).

There's also an idea and interest to integrate MakeHuman to the Naali client, so that you can open it with a click of a button there to edit your av etc. I'll talk with him in Dec or Jan more to see if we can come up with a feasible plan for this.

P.S. I was once proud and happy to be given the job to announce the Suzanne Award for the best Blender script of the year for the MakeHuman team, at the Blender conference -- we had to send the statue over to Italy for them as they were not present, but still :) Apparently the year was 2004, they've been working on this for a while.. (it's not a Blender script anymore but a standalone app).
