All noted and understood Diva.

For recent reports, I am reporting for Openvue grid using 
opensim-tree-d056afb...  2010-12-10  r/14628 0.7.1 dev master

The folks doing these tests are I believe all VERY aware we are using 
bleeding edge revisions and will take care to allow for reversions to 
earlier data bases, etc.  The upgrade of OSGrid to versions of the 
0.7.1 dev master branch code rather than the stable 0.7.0.2 release 
available at that time I think has meant the testing got speeded up 
somewhat a well, but has meant that there is a mish mash of 
development and stable versions around... which makes trackign down 
genuine recent version errors tricky.  But we now have a number of 
incomparable grids/standalones again on the latest version from 0.7.1 
dev master so can look for genuine new bugs in those.

The &quot;interface&quot; numbers I was referring to was something in a commit 
a while ago which meant HG1.5 grids that previously could 
interoperate stopped being able to do so.  kidd peko of &quot;The 
Hypergates&quot; started referring to HG1.5 i6 and the newer HG1.5 i7 
grids to help testers and those interoperating know which sub-set they were in.

See some of his notes at:
<A HREF="http://thehypergates.com/content/outbound-hypergrid-jumps-osgrid-still-broken">http://thehypergates.com/content/outbound-hypergrid-jumps-osgrid-still-broken</A>

Hopefully we can stabilise this and sort out the OSGrid 
interoperability issues when 0.7.1 becomes a RC and then the 
recommended stable release.
