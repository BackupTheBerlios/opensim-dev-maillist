I think the nearest thing we current have is avatar to avatar inventory transfer.  Look in
OpenSim/Region/CoreModules.Avatar/Inventory.Transfer/InventoryTransferModule.cs for this.

The Scene.GiveInventoryFolder() method is the important one.  For the sending agent ID you might be able to supply the 
uuid for the library 'user'.
