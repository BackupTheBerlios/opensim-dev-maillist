<PRE>I wasn't very involved with Opensim at the time of the Master Avatar and I
can understand why that concept was removed in favor of privilege levels
and think that's a good change.  But having to set the Estate and Estate
Owner by hand for each region is not a pleasant task and I also wish it
were configurable in the region.ini file.

As a use case example from the University of Cincinnati grid, I have a
class with 20 students, each student will be assigned their own region for
a large scale project.  When setting up their regions, even with copying
and pasting, it was quite tedious to have to enter the estate and estate
owner 20 times.  Because of the order in which you have to enter the data
in the console, it's not a simple copy pastex20 as it would have been in an
.ini file.

I always feel badly that I'm not a developer myself and can't help
contribute in that way, but in terms of feedback, I'd love to see an .ini
way to configure ALL of the required initial region creation settings.
 Perhaps down the line even non-required things like initial land height,
terrain textures, etc.  It's far more workflow friendly and less prone to
making a mistake entering that information in an .ini file than it is to
enter it over and over and over in the console window.

Having said that, though, I'm assuming there's something funky about the
Estate and Estate Owner that makes it non-trivial to change since so many
people have asked how to change estate/estate owner on the listserv before
and the answer seems to require fiddling with the database directly.  I'm
not sure why that is though.

Sincerely,

- Chris/Fleep
