<PRE>Hi Teravus, nice to hear from you again!

Yes, more testing is needed, hopefully on OSGrid.  But it seems there may be a tradeoff between having super smooth 
physics objects and being able to get more avatars in a scene without encountering cpu limits.  My perception is having 
more avatars is a more common use case then lots of physics objects, particularly as OpenSim's current ODE use does not 
seem to provide a good physics simulation).  Anybody who does want to try for better physics could always turn the 
collision number back up.

In any case, what was the rationale for choosing 80 as the default?

</I>&gt;<i> Think of it like...    you have a cube shaped trimesh...   and the cube's corners are touching a flat ground.   In

</I>&gt;<i> then only three of the corners are being held above ground.   On a larger scale,   If you do that enough, then the
</I>&gt;<i> object will partially fall through the ground and then bounce back up from an excessive contact resolution force
</I>&gt;<i> creating instability and vibrating.
</I>&gt;<i> Those are the indicators that I would use to determine if it's OK to make that change.   Are 8 contacts enough for ODE
</I>&gt;<i> to react properly in our usage?   That remains to be seen :).

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; According to [2], the maximum reported scripting collision contacts is 8.

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; Testing with 8 on Wright Plaza today in the Tuesday meeting seemed to greatly reduce physics scene time compared to
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; previously without any apparent loss of required fidelity (50ms with 18 avatars, albeit mostly sitting down -
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; unfortunately I didn't record previous week's numbers but they were higher.  Nebadon tested one of his vehicles).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Looking at the code, contacts_per_collision is the number of collision points reported by ODE for each collision --
</I>&gt;<i>     like a prim sitting on rough terrain and touching multiple places on the ground. Reducing the count to 8 means that
</I>&gt;<i>     no more than 8 contact points will be reported by ODE and, if there are more, you can't be sure you get the 'best' ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I suspect that most of the time there are only a few contact points so it doesn't make sense that reducing the
</I>&gt;<i>     number from 80 to 8 would significantly reduce the compute time. If it is the number of contact points causing the
</I>&gt;<i>     computation overhead then ODE must be normally returning more than 8 contact points. Is this really the case? Or is
</I>&gt;<i>     something else going on?
