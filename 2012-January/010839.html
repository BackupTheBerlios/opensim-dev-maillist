Multi-region is a non-experimental configuration that is useful to a large number of people.  In my view, it's not 
correct for out-of-the-box OpenSimulator to continue with such crashes in the long term.  This hurts adoption and 
ultimate long-term success/survival.

However, it just so happens that on scouring the Internet, GIMPACT is actually the newer collider, as per [1].  I don't 
know why I thought it was the other way around - I may have misinterpreted something that somebody said.

Indeed, apparently for our common use case (mostly static objects), GIMPACT should perform better, so I was also wrong 
about the performance issue.  However, as I said, in my own testing I haven't yet noticed any significant difference and 
these questions are complex ones.  But it's certainly my experience that using GIMPACT eliminates the ODE crashes in 
stress-testing, possibly due to something connected with [2] where global object caches are shared between collision 
spaces.  But this is still a wild-assed guess (we can't use TLS as OpenSim crashes immediately upon startup).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> testing, reducing this number can halve scene physics time.  Normal avatar operations, such as standing on prims or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> walking up ramps appear to be unaffected even at 1.  However, more testing is probably needed to arrive at a compromise

</I>&gt;<i> This would greatly affect scripts using physics. I believe the

</I>
According to [2], the maximum reported scripting collision contacts is 8.

Testing with 8 on Wright Plaza today in the Tuesday meeting seemed to greatly reduce physics scene time compared to 
previously without any apparent loss of required fidelity (50ms with 18 avatars, albeit mostly sitting down - 
unfortunately I didn't record previous week's numbers but they were higher.  Nebadon tested one of his vehicles).

Testing will continue on the osgrid plazas.
