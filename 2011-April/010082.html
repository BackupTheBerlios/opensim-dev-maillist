<PRE>Hi Dear,

Thanks for the previous help! Now, I am in a position to create a new
region on a remote system and now working to transfer the client from a
region to the newly generated region. I have a bit of confusion here in
Client and Agent, that are clearly defined in the wiki. In some older work
to get circuitcode it is referred to a client through ClientManager of a
scene object. I can see that there is a change in the code now, I been
through the serializable class for agentCiruitData, which I am assuming is
the replacement to get serialization for a client data.

I am asking for some guidance if I am looking into the right place at this
point. I was thinking to see how the teleport mechanism is working which
might give me an idea. I am sorry, if asking something too stupid. Thanks
again! Need guidance in a correct direction.

Best wishes and have a good day.

Umar
