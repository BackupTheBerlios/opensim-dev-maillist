<PRE>Dear OpenSim developers,

I am a researcher from the Saarland University. Recently I have been
studying existing virtual worlds and stumbled upon OpenSimulator. I have
heard of it before, however I always considered OpenSimulator a an
open-source implementation of Second Life server and nothing more. As I have
found out, I was wrong - OpenSim does support other protocols than SL. I
became curious to know if you also support other architectures than Second
Life's, since to our opinion regions are not scalable enough with Second
Life. Please help me answering the following questions about what can
current version of OpenSimulator do:

   1. Can OpenSim create non-square regions? Can OpenSim create overlapping
   regions? Can I bound my regions also in 3rd dimension?
   2. Can OpenSim separate part of the volume of a region to a dedicated
   server (think of a very popular bar with lots of users in the castle)?
   3. Can OpenSim separate object scripting, location synchronization and
   physics for one region into different physical servers?
   4. Which one of these methods for improving scalability of a
region&lt;<A HREF="http://opensim-dev.2196679.n2.nabble.com/Region-Scalability-was-Re-Hi-All-td4470793.html">http://opensim-dev.2196679.n2.nabble.com/Region-Scalability-was-Re-Hi-All-td4470793.html</A>&gt;do
you currently consider? Is there some method that is already
implemented?

Most of these questions are inspired by Sirikata, which was the first world
that I have learned about. I do not expect that you are able to do all that,
since you have used totally different approach to design your system.
However, I have seen attempts to extend the architecture already (e.g.
Hypergrid mode) and would like to know how far these attempts are reaching.

Also I am looking for some scientific papers (tech reports, white papers,
scientific journal articles) related to OpenSim. Please give me some
pointers.

Thank you,
