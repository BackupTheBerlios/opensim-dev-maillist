Client refers to the viewer as a whole.  An agent is an agent of the client in a particular region of a particular 
simulator.  Each agent has a separate network connection (circuit) with the client.

Agents can be root agents or child agents.  A root agent exists in the sim that the client's avatar is in.  A lot of the 
interaction with the simulator flows through this root agent.

Child agents existing on neighbouring regions and send back information about events on those regions - this is why the 
viewer can 'see' into those regions even though they might be hosted on remote servers.

AgentCircuitData does hold connection information.  ClientManager is probably a name from the old days.

</I>&gt;<i> again! Need guidance in a correct direction.
</I>
The bulk of the code for the teleport mechanism is in 
OpenSim/Region/CoreModules/Framework/EntityTransfer/EntityTransferModule.  It is involved and complicated so will 
probably require a large amount of study.  Unfortunately, I don't know of any place where the teleport mechanism is 
documented at a higher level.
