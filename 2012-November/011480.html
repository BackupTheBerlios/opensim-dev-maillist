<PRE>Hi James.  Sorry it's taken so long for me to reply, various work pressures and other stuff.

Yeah, personally I'm happy going with Mono.Addins.  As you say, we're already using it and going with the MEF would mean 
rolling a repository system.  Also, I see some talk that Mono.Addins could just use the MEF as it's underlying basis in 
the future anyway.

Now some other points.

* IRobustConnector appears to assume that all ROBUST plugins implement HTTP handlers.  However, some plugins may just 
provide extra debug console commands (some such region plugins exist already) or extend other plugins (and thus don't 
implement their own handlers).  How would these work?  This would also be a problem with IRobustConnector.Configure() 
passing back a number for the listening port.

* Why provide the option to pull down a bootstrap.ini?  This seems overcomplicated to me but perhaps an example would 
make it clearer.  And writing this data to an existing ini file makes me a bit nervous, esp. on windows since, for 
instance, the write could fail if the user also has the file open.

* I think IRobustConnector would be better named IRobustServerInConnector or similar to match XInventoryInConnector, 
GridInfoServerInConnector, etc. in OpenSim.Server.Handlers.  I like the *InConnnector because this better distinguishes 
the inbound ROBUST handlers from the simulator outbound requests (which are also called connectors and are, as we know, 
in OpenSim.Service.Connectors.

In fact, I would personally prefer to see the *InConnectors called something different to make the difference with the 
outbound connectors much clearer in the code.  However, nothing springs to mind - perhaps InConnector is good enough.

Of course, this isn't helped by the inconsistency in OpenSim.Server.Handlers naming (where most are just named 
ServerConnector).  Or the fact that these extend ServiceConnector (which implements IServiceConnector) but yet are in a 
file named ServerConnector.cs.

* From your previous e-mail, I think it would be better to start off with the specific interface for dynamic plugins and 
then look at modifying IServiceConnector once the code is in core and the implications are understood.

* I certainly think it would be good to extend such a system to region modules.  But I think there are various issues 
there which I'd prefer to discuss at a later point rather than extend this e-mail.

I also took the liberty of updating <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Feature_Proposals/PluginManager">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Feature_Proposals/PluginManager</A> with instructions, etc.

Best,

Justin
