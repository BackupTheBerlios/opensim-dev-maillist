<PRE>&gt;<i> Doing some researching for a patent here in Norway a few
</I>&gt;<i> years back I found that it was near impossible (here) to get a &gt; patent
</I>unless what you made was revolutionary new.
&gt;<i> Anything that would be considered the next step was not &gt;enough for a
</I>patent.

Our system in the U.S. is so screwed up, it's basically worthless.  It's
only good for the &quot;patent troll&quot; attorneys that spend their days just
looking for people to sue.

As far as doing anything for anyone (other than lawyers) they're useless.
 It's turning into &quot;nuclear arms&quot; race type of warfare, and the whole system
just needs to be done away with.

Software patents are a bad idea, and they need to be abolished.  I like your
system in Norway, it seems to make more sense (and eliminating 80% of the
silly nonsense patent crap in the U.S. would really help innovation and
development.

Our patent system is complete garbage, and it's just a form of &quot;corporate
warfare&quot; that is used by large companies to strong arm one another, and to
stifle off any competition (or kill off any small startups or young
companies that don't have the &quot;deep pockets&quot; to afford large legal battles).


I'd abolish at least 70-80% of the system, and toss the DMCA crap out as
well.  Our whole patent/copyright system needs some serious work.  There
needs to be some &quot;fair use&quot; clauses (for educational, research, and
development purposes) and also patents should only be good for a maximum of
5 years, that's it.

After 5 years, it's public domain.  That would help bring an end to all this
silly stupidity (and expensive litigation costs, and silly legal battles).
 If you can't bring your product to market (and a 5 year head start is not
enough time for you) then you don't deserve to have a patent anyways.

Too many clowns file patents just for the purpose of suing others.
 Completely useless, and just use it as a means to litigate and kill off
competition.  The large corporations do it just to bully other companies
around (with legal threats) and they all just build up &quot;arsenals&quot; of patents
that they can use against one another.

It's a silly game, and it needs to be abolished.

*&gt; It *should* have a block against patenting things that *
*&gt; are a natural evolution of existing technology.*

Agreed.  Now just try explaining that to the patent examiner's office.
