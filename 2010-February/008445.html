<PRE>If there is no need for a grid server, then there would be no need for a 
TOS that would try to control a TPV.

I see the issue of opensim that wants to say &quot;can only connect client to 
a grid server as supported by opensim&quot; no different than Linden Lab's 
new TOS in attempts to control TPVs.

If we modify LL's official viewer and add client-side simulation to help 
dispel latency, with physics prediction, then their TOS says &quot;no,&quot; you 
have to register your special viewer to connect.

Melanie stated that opensim is grid server only (like a TOS), which in 
essence, is logical equivalent to say, &quot;you can't modify opensim in 
order to add a viewer and connect to our grid server&quot;

One obvious question is: who's grid server?

With physics prediction being equal peer to peer, why would there ever 
need to be a grid server, or a TOS?

 &gt;&gt;&gt; You're confusing the architecture of the software with what people 
want to do with it.

So, are they saying they don't want physics prediction?
