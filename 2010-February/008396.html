Adam/Chris/Melanie/Diva,

 

&gt;<i> since I don't have any Linux machines at my disposal for mono 
</I>
&gt;<i> testing (and my development servers will be going on shipping
</I>
&gt;<i> containers for a month in the very near future).
</I>
 

If you need any hardware just let me know.  I can set a box (or a few boxes)
up for you, just let me know what you need.  I have about 10 or 12 servers
just sitting here not being used (Quad and Eight core Xeon &quot;Nehalem&quot;-based
servers with 16+GB or 32+GB of RAM).   

 

Just let me know what you need, what you want installed on the boxes
(Ubuntu, Windows Server 2008 R2, etc.) and I can get something setup for you
that you can use for development/testing and sandbox purposes.

 

Just let me know what you want, and I can get something built for you in a
day or so.  Then I'll give you a root login, and you can do whatever it is
that you need/want to do (I can setup remote desktop, VPN, or SSH/FTP or
whatever it is that you may want for remote access/administration).

 

Just let me know what OS you want, and what version of Mono you want
installed (or I can simply just install Ubuntu, or Windows Server 2008 R2 or
even one server of each, and you can install whatever it is that you want on
the box after that).

 

This way you have a development box (or two) that you can use remotely, and
you can share with others (if you want) for testing/development purposes.
If it will help you, Adam, Melanie, Crista/Diva, by giving you a development
&quot;sandbox&quot; for a 0.6.9 and 0.7 RC.  This way you can just use the box for
development, bug testing, bug fixing, refactoring and whatever you need to
do to help with the upcoming 0.7 RC.  

 

I could setup a Ubuntu box with SQLite, and also setup a Windows 2008 R2 box
with MySQL so you can test out both the 0.6.9 and future 0.7 RC  (and use
the hardware platforms for internal development, SQLite &amp; MySQL testing,
sandboxing and bug testing purposes of the 0.6.9 and RC 0.7)  I don't mind
hosting the servers, I have the extra equipment and bandwidth for as long as
you need them (indefinitely).  Just tell me what you want, and give me a day
to set it up.

 

I have the hardware, and I'm offering... 

 

                Just let me know,

 

                         Mark

I had said I would look at SQLite but I honestly don't think I will have
time, plus if there are significant mono-related issues then I am not
best positioned to work on it in any case, since I don't have any Linux
machines at my disposal for mono testing (and my development servers
will be going on shipping containers for a month in the very near
future).

Personally, I have MSSQL code to finish for presence refactor branch
(likely a few more days of work there), I would like to get that in if
there's plans to move forward at some point, but my pieces shouldn't be
too hard to plug in, unlike something like a core architecture refactor.

I imagine the SOG refactor is going to take some time to work in since
it's a major piece of work - if that scale of work starts before SQLite
can be fixed then it will be many more months of waiting for consumers
who like tagged revisions before a working revision emerges. Is there
another option here?  Suggest that SQLite users stick to 0.6.8 (even if
it is semi broken I guess it is better than totally broken), push the
presence refactor into trunk and continue to plead for more assistance
on SQLite?

Chris

Sigh.
It's ready. It's been fully operational for several weeks, modulo
buglets. It hasn't been merged because the SQLite connector hasn't been
redone and at least Melanie doesn't want to merge without it.

For me, the SQLite connector continues to be a big question mark.
There's the show-stopper bug with mono 2.4.3+, which Teravus has been
spending an enormous amount of time trying to fix, without success so
far. And then there's writing the code for the new tables, which I might

attempt doing if absolutely no one else comes forward; but if I do it,
it won't be pretty, and that code risks going outdated again. I just
don't know enough about SQLite to do it properly in the amount of time I

have to OpenSim.

Adam, I hate to suggest this, but you could start your SOG refactor in
that branch already. John Hurliman is doing his other implementation of
the resource services using that branch.
