<PRE>The new Naali UI really does look sweet!!

Could we have BOTH a new &quot;icon&quot; based UI, and also the option to turn on
&quot;classic&quot; mode (which would have the old legacy-type tool bar menu at the
top of the screen)  Also have a &quot;disappear&quot; option on the toolbar that you
can turn on and off.  That way if you move your mouse over the top of the
screen the menu will drop down, and if you move it away the menu will
disappear again.  Kinda like the &quot;Start&quot; menu in Windows XP or Windows
Vista.  You can click the &quot;enable toolbar&quot; option to enable the tool bar at
the top of the screen and you can also check the &quot;hide toolbar&quot; checkbox
under options, and the toolbar will be hidden and will re-appear if you
place your mouse over the top portion of the screen (the toolbar will drop
down).

This way there are 3 different modes of navigation, there is the cool new UI
navigation that is being developed, plus the old legacy &quot;classic&quot; view (of
using a tool bar for those people that really do like the old legacy-type
Windows tool bars that are &quot;always on&quot; and easy to see and easy to find and
easy to understand and always located at the top of the screen).  Plus the
third option of being able to turn the tool bar on (enabled) but have a
&quot;hide toolbar&quot; option where the toolbar is on (but hidden) and it drops down
when you scroll over the top portion of the screen.

This way users can have the best of both worlds.  They can have the cool new
UI interface (which is great for navigating with a remote, wireless
controller, or even a mouse), but for the older generation that really does
like toolbars (and for people that have a hard time finding icons, or trying
to figure out where to place the mouse to navigate or where to find the
toolbar options that they are used to) at least having a &quot;classic&quot; toolbar
that can be turned on or off, and also turned on (but &quot;hidden&quot;), so that way
users can use BOTH, or one or the other, or even have the menu toolbar at
the top enabled (but hidden) and that way users can use whichever they
choose.

&gt;<i> Wow!!!!  Excellent!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is excellent work!  The new interface looks great!  It really looks
</I>&gt;<i> sweet, almost looks like a Mac, or almost looks like a &quot;Windows 7&quot; type of
</I>&gt;<i> interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The UI is really coming along nicely.  I understand the Naali platform is
</I>&gt;<i> still under heavy development and still a bit behind in the &quot;feature
</I>&gt;<i> completeness&quot; that the old realXtend viewer has, but this new UI really does
</I>&gt;<i> look fantastic, and it really shows how much &quot;Naali&quot; shines!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This new UI really blows the old viewer away! (as far as user friendliness)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really do like the concept of &quot;Ether&quot;.  Will it simply create &quot;snapshot&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> images (thumbnails) of the various worlds you have visited? (similar to how
</I>&gt;<i> Google Chrome creates snapshots of your most recently viewed web pages?),
</I>&gt;<i> and can you simply click on one of the snapshot pictures from the recently
</I>&gt;<i> viewed pages and it will take you to that world?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How will the &quot;Quick Logins&quot; pictures be updated?  (Will a thumbnail image
</I>&gt;<i> be created and be stored on every world/grid server, and will those
</I>&gt;<i> thumbnails just be downloaded the first time you view a world?  Similar to a
</I>&gt;<i> web icon image stored in the root folder of a web server?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That way you could have a &quot;most recently visited&quot; page that will show all
</I>&gt;<i> the thumbnails from the most recently visited worlds that you've been to
</I>&gt;<i> (similar to how Google Chrome has the UI with the most recently visited web
</I>&gt;<i> pages).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really do like the scrolling UI (it does look like a Mac or Windows 7
</I>&gt;<i> type of interface, it looks great!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also will we be having an &quot;Audi&quot; world released soon?  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed the Audi world in the video.  Does this mean we will have a shiny
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Beneath the Sea&quot; and a nice new &quot;Audi&quot; world both included with the next
</I>&gt;<i> server release of RealXtend?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The new Naali UI really does look fantastic, and I really like how it gets
</I>&gt;<i> away from the old &quot;typing&quot; on a keyboard approach.  This new UI would really
</I>&gt;<i> be great for consoles, set-top-boxes, and with touchscreen computers, and
</I>&gt;<i> even gaming consoles (XBOX 360, PS3, etc.) or even HTPC's that are normally
</I>&gt;<i> connected to televisions, and used with wireless remote controls, wireless
</I>&gt;<i> mice or even wireless gaming controllers (like the XBOX 360 controllers).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can't wait to try that new UI with an XBOX 360 controller!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Gaming-Receiver-Windows-Pc/dp/B000HZFCT2">http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Gaming-Receiver-Windows-Pc/dp/B000HZFCT2</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would be fantastic to be able to select worlds, and create new Avatars
</I>&gt;<i> from the comfort of my couch, while using an XBOX 360 controller!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's an XBOX 360 wireless controller and wireless receiver for windows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Windows-pc/dp/B000KA5T6A/ref=pd_sim_vg_1">http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Windows-pc/dp/B000KA5T6A/ref=pd_sim_vg_1</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe there are even Linux drivers floating around on the web as well.
</I>&gt;<i>  The XBOX 360 controller has a nice 30+ ft range, it would probably be great
</I>&gt;<i> if we can design the Naali UI in a &quot;console friendly&quot; way, so that it could
</I>&gt;<i> be navigated with an XBOX 360 controller.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully the new UI will make using and porting Naali to XBOX 360 (or even
</I>&gt;<i> PS3) fairly easy.  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We might need to add a &quot;pop up&quot; text keyboard (on-screen keyboard) that
</I>&gt;<i> looks similar to the &quot;texting&quot; keyboard on the iPhone (used for sending text
</I>&gt;<i> messages).  That way you can simply use your mouse (or an XBOX 360
</I>&gt;<i> controller) for typing from the couch, and also we may want to look into
</I>&gt;<i> adding Voice dictation software (like &quot;Dragon Naturally Speaking&quot;) so you
</I>&gt;<i> can speak and it will do the typing for you (if a microphone is available).
</I>&gt;<i>  Most users with a webcam (and a webcam with an integrated microphone) have
</I>&gt;<i> the ability to use voice dictation software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even many of the newer 1080p HDTV televisions have webcams and microphones
</I>&gt;<i> built into them now (like the 2010 LG and Samsungs that have built-in
</I>&gt;<i> support for Skype and SkypeHD).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully with an &quot;onscreen keyboard&quot; and some Voice Recognition/dictation
</I>&gt;<i> software (like Dragon Naturally Speaking) users can just sit on their couch,
</I>&gt;<i> and navigate using an XBOX 360 remote (and speak with an XBOX 360 gaming
</I>&gt;<i> headset).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dragon Naturally Speaking has some excellent navigation capabilities.  I
</I>&gt;<i> wonder if we can get it to work with Naali Viewer?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would give users the ability to sit on the couch and just navigate
</I>&gt;<i> with an XBOX 360 remote, and speak into the headset for live chat (via a
</I>&gt;<i> Skype/voice module in RealXtend) and also be able to type via voice
</I>&gt;<i> recognition software (like Dragon Speaking Naturally) and also have an &quot;on
</I>&gt;<i> screen keyboard&quot; for those users that don't have a microphone or don't have
</I>&gt;<i> any voice recognition software.
