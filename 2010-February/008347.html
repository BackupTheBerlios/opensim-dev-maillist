<PRE>Greetings all!

I recently wanted to familiarize myself better with many of the console
commands and among them I tried my hand at using the console to create a new
region while in-world.  I came upon the following issue:

I'd already created my first region, named &quot;TestRegion&quot; in the normal
fashion and logged into the region and was flying around - all was normal.

I then typed into the console:

create region NewRegion NewRegion.ini

Then followed the normal practice for naming the new region (NewRegion) and
assigning it port 9001, etc.

But in-world the new region did not appear.  When bringing up the world map
it was shown there, but not in the mini-map.  I teleported to my home
position (128,128 default) and then the new region appeared in the mini map,
but I was still unable to fly into it - in-world it showed nothing was
there.

I ran the shutdown console command then restarted the OS server and when I
logged in the new region was then visible in-world and I could fly into it,
with everything working as expected.

Is this a typical situation or something new?  Previously I always had all
my regions listed in a single regions.ini file and since my home region
started first, I could log in and actually watch the regions around me
appearing in-world.  I'm guessing there's some kind of communication error
keeping the new region created via console from appearing in-world, yet
showing up in the map and mini-map.

My Operating System for this example is Windows 7 Home Premium, all updates
applied.  Oh, and this is with the 0.6.8 binary release, not a currently
build.

I'll be pleased to file a bug report if this is indeed an undocumented bug.
I could not find anything specific to this issue in the jira myself.

Thanks all!
