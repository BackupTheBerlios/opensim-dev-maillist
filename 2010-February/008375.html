<PRE>I had said I would look at SQLite but I honestly don't think I will have
time, plus if there are significant mono-related issues then I am not
best positioned to work on it in any case, since I don't have any Linux
machines at my disposal for mono testing (and my development servers
will be going on shipping containers for a month in the very near
future).

Personally, I have MSSQL code to finish for presence refactor branch
(likely a few more days of work there), I would like to get that in if
there's plans to move forward at some point, but my pieces shouldn't be
too hard to plug in, unlike something like a core architecture refactor.

I imagine the SOG refactor is going to take some time to work in since
it's a major piece of work - if that scale of work starts before SQLite
can be fixed then it will be many more months of waiting for consumers
who like tagged revisions before a working revision emerges. Is there
another option here?  Suggest that SQLite users stick to 0.6.8 (even if
it is semi broken I guess it is better than totally broken), push the
presence refactor into trunk and continue to plead for more assistance
on SQLite? 

Chris

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Status of presence refactor?

Sigh.
It's ready. It's been fully operational for several weeks, modulo 
buglets. It hasn't been merged because the SQLite connector hasn't been 
redone and at least Melanie doesn't want to merge without it.

For me, the SQLite connector continues to be a big question mark. 
There's the show-stopper bug with mono 2.4.3+, which Teravus has been 
spending an enormous amount of time trying to fix, without success so 
far. And then there's writing the code for the new tables, which I might

attempt doing if absolutely no one else comes forward; but if I do it, 
it won't be pretty, and that code risks going outdated again. I just 
don't know enough about SQLite to do it properly in the amount of time I

have to OpenSim.

Adam, I hate to suggest this, but you could start your SOG refactor in 
that branch already. John Hurliman is doing his other implementation of 
the resource services using that branch.
