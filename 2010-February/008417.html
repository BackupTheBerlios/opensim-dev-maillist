<PRE>Hi

pop.domain.us
smtp.domain.co.uk
mail.domain.fr
www.domain.de
ns1.domain.es
sql.domain.com
domain.sim

One doesn't fit. :)
Currently internet is built on a system where TLD's being allocated to
geographic/organizational relation, and subdomains are
server(service)-specific. Even more so as they are considering adding TLD's
for cities as well (to loosen up competition for domain names).

Private networks such as I2P use their own TLD because the service offered
is geographically unknown, doesn't reside on a fixed IP and should *really*
not be resolvable from the internet.

I see a whole lot of misunderstandings, technical difficulties, etc. in
adding it. And no benefits.

BR,
 Tedd

Subject: [Opensim-dev] Suggested in-world DNS: .sim

One of the natures of the internet is for alternate backbones. This 
feature is rarely used, but easily to add through hosts definition files 
and DNS hops. After enough people agree to use these new alternate 
backbones, then they could be proposed to IANA for more static backbone 
networks.

If you are familiar with freenode, you probably already understand how 
some of this works.

With opensim, I wanted to suggest a new TLD: .sim

That way simulators can easily find each other based on name/host 
resolutions. This could lead to more dynamic region presence.

In one sense, it would basically mean to drop a DNS/BIND server into 
opensim. I'm sure people in-world would like their own &quot;in-world 
internet&quot; to work beyond simulators even if the simulator isn't bordered 
on the physical sides on the other simulator.

IPv6 if you will...
