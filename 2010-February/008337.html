<PRE>Sounds like the patent trolls are digging for more information.

*&gt; &gt;      I know that the various versions of the viewer are derived from
&gt;<i> &gt; Linden Lab releasing the viewer source code as open source, but what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about the server side of things?*
</I>
Does anyone ask the Keebler elves how they make their cookies?

<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep2lGBZptl0&amp;NR=1">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep2lGBZptl0&amp;NR=1</A>

Look at the functionality of the viewer, write and develop a server that
will support the functions of the viewer.  Develop a server with all the new
and wonderful features, functionality and fixes that core devs and users
would like to see added (OSSL).  Create a modular approach so other groups
can improve upon it, and take other OpenSource projects and integrate them
into OpenSim (i.e. ModRex).  Eventually decide that the viewer isn't good
enough, scrap the viewer, and then write a completely new viewer (supporting
all the functions and features that you want to add).  The project just
continuously evolves, it doesn't come from one group or one place.  Just
like original SL or SL Viewer doesn't come from one person or one place.
 (More than likely it was &quot;inspired' by Active Worlds).  The &quot;3D Web&quot;
continues to evolve.  Communities of people and developers come together,
and make it is what it is.  OpenSim just attempts to make a &quot;standard open
source platform&quot; of it all.  Enough said?  The server just evolves, portions
and areas are reworked to improve performance (or add additional
functionality).  The server endures a few rewrites as it moves along.  Parts
and pieces are taken from various other projects (i.e. Ogre3D, PAL, ODE,
Newton, etc.)  A new framework is written, and slowly you have a nice new
OpenSource development platform.  Features are slowly added as they are
requested.  Ideas from the community inspire the developers, and slowly the
project evolves.  Where did Firefox or &quot;OpenOffice.org&quot; come from?  Talented
individuals, that believe in the OpenSource community.

Just because you see 4 or 5 different web browsers (or Open Source web
browsers) doesn't mean that they are all copies of one another (or reverse
engineered).  Someone sees something, they are intrigued by it, or they
think of a new feature and they begin writing the code necessary to make it
happen.  It takes a lot of hard work.

How did Mosaic browser get off the ground?  How did Microsoft's IIS get off
the ground?  How did Internet Explorer get off the ground?  How did Apache
web server get off the ground?  It takes some creativity, innovation, and a
dedicated group of people with a whole lot of brains to develop a new open
source &quot;standard platform&quot; that can be used for &quot;3D Web&quot;.

I supposed by definition, we have actually developed &quot;a patchy&quot; OpenSim
server.
