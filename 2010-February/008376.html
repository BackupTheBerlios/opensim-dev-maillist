<PRE>It's not fully there, I still haven't finished friends. RL, the need
to produce immediate revenue, and the absence of SQLite support, all
contributed to that.

I'm wrestling with the client on that, because OpenSim has some
badness there. Specifically, if you are missing an online friend
(that even happens in the LL grid!), as soon as you IM them, they IM
you, or you enter the sim they're in, they change to online in the
LL grid.

In OpenSim, they do not. You can be standing next to a person while
your FL claims they're offline, and receive IM that come in as
offline IM (with time stamp) while they are actively talking to you
online.

Right now, I don't see a way to let the client update that without
annoying AgentAlerts (bottom eight hand box &quot;XXX is online&quot;) for
EVERY friend on sim entry.

So, I'll probably have to attach at least a simple list of online
friends to the agant data for interregion, and I HATE that thought!
That stuff really SHOULD be stateless!

Well, that is the status there.

I would not like to see the refactor start in the branch, because
that would postpone a merge indefinitely.

However, the refactor caould be started in a NEW branch that is
based off the current presence-refactor. The friends and SQLite
functionality could be merged back to that new branch when they are
completed. Git allows this easily.
