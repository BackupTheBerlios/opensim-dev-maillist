<PRE>Let's bring the focus of this thread back. We're about to merge the  
presence-refactor branch into the master branch, and then we'll need  
testers, some of us will be working overtime to fix the bugs, and  
hopefully Fly-Man- will update Wiredux sometime soon. Then a big  
effort in documentation will start.
There's a lot of work to do. The last thing we need is switching  
development tools.

</I>&gt;<i> It usually takes less than 3 minutes for a developer to figure out  
</I>&gt;<i> how to right click, and how to click &quot;Synchronize&quot; or &quot;Create  
</I>&gt;<i> clone&quot;.  You don't need to learn or memorize any commands, just use  
</I>&gt;<i> TortoiseHG.  It's automatically embedded into Windows File Explorer  
</I>&gt;<i> (or Linux) so all you have to do is right click on a folder or file  
</I>&gt;<i> and you can rename, update, synchronize, commit or do whatever you  
</I>&gt;<i> want with just one simple click.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Intelligent Synchronization really does make life easier for  
</I>&gt;<i> developers on large collaboration projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We don't have to do an &quot;immediate&quot; transition to Mercurial, but I  
</I>&gt;<i> can setup both Git and Mercurial (concurrently) and then we can  
</I>&gt;<i> slowly move users over to Mercurial (once they feel comfortable) and  
</I>&gt;<i> I can create a nice online tutorial for the dev's that are  
</I>&gt;<i> unfamiliar with Merc, and also provide links and a tutorial for  
</I>&gt;<i> TortoiseHG (just so dev's can see how extremely easy it is, and it  
</I>&gt;<i> really requires NO learning at all).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You just right click on a file, or right click on a folder, and then  
</I>&gt;<i> select &quot;merge&quot; and that's it.  The easy-to-use GUI really makes life  
</I>&gt;<i> EXTREMELY simple on the dev's.  I think Mercurial is much better  
</I>&gt;<i> than Git for mobile users, and a project like OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can handle the backend work (server admin, backups, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This way the dev's can just focus on developing (and writing code).   
</I>&gt;<i> I can run both a Git and a Mercurial on the same box, that way it  
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't even matter what the dev's are using, both will point  
</I>&gt;<i> towards the same folders on the server.  This way as dev's slowly  
</I>&gt;<i> move (and transition) from Git over to Mercurial, it will make life  
</I>&gt;<i> easy on them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once you start using Mercurial, I really do think you'll love it  
</I>&gt;<i> (and will wonder how you ever did without it).  Mercurial has the  
</I>&gt;<i> nice user GUI from TortoiseSVN (TortoiseHG for both Windows and  
</I>&gt;<i> Linux) but has the speed and advanced tools (intelligent merging/ 
</I>&gt;<i> synchronization) of Mercurial/Bazaar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This way we can have plenty of branches, and it takes the headache  
</I>&gt;<i> of maintaining/doing manual conflicts (merges) out of the question.   
</I>&gt;<i> This way you can spend your time developing, and not dealing with  
</I>&gt;<i> the headaches of merging/conflicts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can help with the implementation (and setting up a repository  
</I>&gt;<i> server, that will handle both Git and Mercurial, and I supposed I  
</I>&gt;<i> could even setup a Bazaar server as well if anyone really wants/ 
</I>&gt;<i> needs Bazaar) but Mercurial really should be the &quot;de facto&quot; choice  
</I>&gt;<i> for most of the Devs.  Once the server is setup, and I can write a  
</I>&gt;<i> nice tutorial on using Mercurial, it would be so much easier for the  
</I>&gt;<i> dev's (especially mobile users that are using laptops, or are not  
</I>&gt;<i> connected to the internet 24/7).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Plus the speed of doing large commits is about 800-1000% faster  
</I>&gt;<i> (depending on how many peers are currently online).  Since large  
</I>&gt;<i> commits are sent to various peers, and then fed back to the main  
</I>&gt;<i> server (similar to a torrent/peer/seed type of architecture).  This  
</I>&gt;<i> way the one main server acts as a &quot;seed&quot; for the developers, and  
</I>&gt;<i> it's ALWAYS online, and it &quot;seeds&quot; the network, but transfers are  
</I>&gt;<i> done P2P and also fed back to the main seed.  That way the &quot;seed&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> always has an up to date version (that is archived and backed up  
</I>&gt;<i> nightly).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It may sound like a lot of work, but really it's not.  I can get it  
</I>&gt;<i> done in about a day or two.  Then maybe another day for writing up  
</I>&gt;<i> tutorials.  Then the dev's can transition to Mercurial at their own  
</I>&gt;<i> pace.  This way there is no pressure, but the advantages of  
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial (and intelligent merging) really are what would be best  
</I>&gt;<i> for a collaborative project like this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think we can survive another move.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You just focus on developing, I can do the server build, setup Merc  
</I>&gt;<i> and Git and also handle the move.  We can save the old Git for  
</I>&gt;<i> archival purposes (just leave it where it's at).  I can just use the  
</I>&gt;<i> new box for Git and Mercurial (for the dev's) and then feed the new  
</I>&gt;<i> repository back to the old Git (for an extra online archival as well).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This way the dev's can move over to the new Mercurial (at their own  
</I>&gt;<i> will), and the new repository server will handle everything (and the  
</I>&gt;<i> old Git will just be used for archival purposes).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I don't want to learn another toolchain, I want to develop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With TortoiseHG you don't have to learn anything.  You just point,  
</I>&gt;<i> and right click.  You don't need to know any commands, don't need to  
</I>&gt;<i> do any packing/repacking of Git, and don't need to do anything.  As  
</I>&gt;<i> a user/developer Mercurial is by far the easiest to use for  
</I>&gt;<i> developers (with the TortoiseHG client installed on your local  
</I>&gt;<i> machine).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can administer the repository, and do backups/snapshots.  That way  
</I>&gt;<i> the dev's don't have to worry about anything.  If someone/something  
</I>&gt;<i> borks something, then just let me know and I can just do a restore  
</I>&gt;<i> (if needed).  But this way the dev's can just focus on developing.

</I>&gt;<i> This way you don't have to deal with the headaches of manually

</I>&gt;<i> Intelligent merging has been around for quite a while, and using  
</I>&gt;<i> something like Git or Subversion (in today's day in age) really  
</I>&gt;<i> seems a bit archaic.  With tools like Mercurial and TortoiseHG you  
</I>&gt;<i> really don't need to learn (or know) anything as a user/developer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just right click on the file, or right click on the folder, and

</I>&gt;<i> you're done.  It really is that easy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Git is a nightmare.  I couldn't even imagine using Git for any  
</I>&gt;<i> serious collaborative project.  You'd spend half of your day just  
</I>&gt;<i> handling conflicts manually, and would be pulling your hair out (as  
</I>&gt;<i> an administrator) if you were using archaic tools like Git.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Plus just wait a few months, and see how much Git slows down (as the  
</I>&gt;<i> project grows) and just wait till you hit a &quot;git-repack&quot; error (or  
</I>&gt;<i> run out of memory) and experience your first Git crash.  That's when  
</I>&gt;<i> you'll be calling your system administrator for help, and wasting a  
</I>&gt;<i> day (or two) dealing with the headaches of Git.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want headaches, stick with Git.  If you want to come out of  
</I>&gt;<i> the dark ages, then use Mercurial (or Bazaar).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I support developers, and I at least understand WHY everyone loves  
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial (or Bazaar).  It's the fastest/easiest/best to use from  
</I>&gt;<i> both a user perspective, and from a system administrator's  
</I>&gt;<i> perspective.  If you've ever maintained large repositories (on large  
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative projects) you'd understand the amount of overhead  
</I>&gt;<i> (work that you must spend with Git) and understand the dangers of  
</I>&gt;<i> Git (database corruption, memory errors, etc) and then you'll begin  
</I>&gt;<i> to understand WHY something like Mercurial or Bazaar is the safest,  
</I>&gt;<i> fastest, and best for any large collaborative project.  (A good sys  
</I>&gt;<i> admin can always run both a Git, and a Mercurial on the same server,  
</I>&gt;<i> just in case there are a few users that need some time to transition  
</I>&gt;<i> over to Mercurial, but it really only takes about 5 minutes to  
</I>&gt;<i> transition over to Mercurial from a user/developer standpoint, and  
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;learning curve&quot; is probably under 2-3 minutes at the most and  
</I>&gt;<i> just by skimming over the TortoiseHG client tutorial, it can  
</I>&gt;<i> probably answer all your questions in just 2-3 minutes).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's extremely easy to see the &quot;icon overlays&quot; in File Explorer (as  
</I>&gt;<i> you're working).  You'll see a nice green checkmark box on the  
</I>&gt;<i> folder (if it's currently up to date and synced).  If another  
</I>&gt;<i> developer has modified a file, or you have modified a file, then you  
</I>&gt;<i> will see a blue plus, then just right click on the file or folder  
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;synchronize&quot; and then all the latest changes are now  
</I>&gt;<i> synchronized on your machine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For groups that want to have their own separate branches, or even do  
</I>&gt;<i> their own private work, it's extremely simple and easy for users/ 
</I>&gt;<i> devs to create various group repositories with just a simple right  
</I>&gt;<i> click of the mouse.  It makes it extremely easy for everyone to  
</I>&gt;<i> collaborate (and stay &quot;up to date&quot;)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial (or Bazaar) really does make collaboration easy.   
</I>&gt;<i> Subversion, CVS, and Git are really from the dark ages.  Once you  
</I>&gt;<i> experience a repository &quot;hiccup&quot; then you'll understand what I  
</I>&gt;<i> mean.  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A user/developer wants to rename a file?  Just right-click, &quot;rename&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> the file, then &quot;synchronize&quot; it's really that easy.  Intelligent  
</I>&gt;<i> merging really does make life simple (Mercurial and Bazaar are  
</I>&gt;<i> designed to do these things).  Mercurial also supports file and  
</I>&gt;<i> directory copies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could always setup Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar on a dedicated  
</I>&gt;<i> server, and then just let the dev's each decide what they want to  
</I>&gt;<i> use.  I personally don't care, but once the Dev's move over to  
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial (or Bazaar) they'll understand how easy it really is (and  
</I>&gt;<i> how simply it is).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Git is a headache to administer, and as a collaborative project  
</I>&gt;<i> grows you'll probably waste half of your time (as a developer) with  
</I>&gt;<i> commits &amp; merging headaches (with Git) but you'd be quite thankful  
</I>&gt;<i> of Mercurial (especially if you synchronize regularly, like once an  
</I>&gt;<i> hour while connected to the internet).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This way you're always up to date, and it's extremely fast using  
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial.

</I>&gt;<i> I can setup a nice repository server (with Git, Mercurial, and

</I>&gt;<i> server can do the backups, archiving, and also feed back to the old  
</I>&gt;<i> Git Server (for online archival purposes).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial is the fastest, most intelligent and by far the best  
</I>&gt;<i> (Bazaar is good as well).  P2P architecture works well, and it there  
</I>&gt;<i> are plenty of &quot;safeguards&quot; to protect the repository (since each  
</I>&gt;<i> local machine .  This way there is plenty of &quot;safeguards&quot; and  
</I>&gt;<i> redundancy.  The last thing you want is to mess around with Git, and  
</I>&gt;<i> then have a repository/database corruption (or out of memory/malloc

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Plus with Mercurial you don't need to do all the &quot;house keeping&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> that you need to do with Git and don't need to manually repack or

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I could setup a Mercurial or Bazaar repository on a server (for

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to collaborate peer to peer (and I can perform backups of the main  
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server, just so we have backup, snapshot and restore points).  It  
</I>&gt;<i> will help
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the &quot;intelligent merging&quot; (for numerous dev's all working  
</I>&gt;<i> together all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at the same time) and we can always feed copies of the Merc  
</I>&gt;<i> repository back
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the old Git and just use the old Git repository as a public  
</I>&gt;<i> archive.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Merc is peer to peer, and supports backups/mirroring, and has lots

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automatically pull periodic changes from your local repositories  
</I>&gt;<i> every hour
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (for all the core dev's).  Since Mercurial maintains a complete  
</I>&gt;<i> copy of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; history in each clone (every single peer), everyone who uses  
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; collaborate on a project can potentially act as a source of  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;backups&quot; in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; event of a &quot;catastrophe&quot; (since there is no real &quot;centralized&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> server).  If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a central repository becomes unavailable, you simply just clone a  
</I>&gt;<i> copy of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the repository from one contributer, and pull any changes they may  
</I>&gt;<i> not have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seen from all the other contributers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mercurial is extremely easy to perform off-site backups and remote  
</I>&gt;<i> mirrors.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Plus I can set it up to perform traditional backups to tape or  
</I>&gt;<i> disk (for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; archival purposes).  This way if there are any problems, we can  
</I>&gt;<i> always roll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; back, or undo or perform disaster recovery.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To do backups, you just use &quot;hg clone -U myrepo myrepo.bak&quot; to  
</I>&gt;<i> create a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clone of the &quot;myrepo&quot; repository and then just perform a nightly  
</I>&gt;<i> backup,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that way automated nightly backups are being performed on the  
</I>&gt;<i> repository.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This way you have something to roll back to, even if disaster does  
</I>&gt;<i> strike (a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dev somehow hoses everything up, which is unlikely) but regardless  
</I>&gt;<i> it never
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hurts to have backups and consistent snapshots.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mercurial maintains a complete copy of history in each clone, so  
</I>&gt;<i> it creates
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; numerous &quot;backups&quot; (and lots of redundancy).  By having a  
</I>&gt;<i> dedicated server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; online, that will just act as a &quot;main peer&quot; at least all the other  
</I>&gt;<i> peers can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feed/seed back to the main peer anytime they are online or  
</I>&gt;<i> connected to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; internet.  The main server will simply act as a &quot;seed&quot;, and all  
</I>&gt;<i> the other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dev's computers (that may go on or offline) will simply act as  
</I>&gt;<i> peers for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; redundancy purposes.  It's almost similar to a &quot;torrent&quot; type of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; architecture (P2P) which is good for speed of uploading/committing  
</I>&gt;<i> large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; updates since it can pull from any of the available online peers  
</I>&gt;<i> that are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; online.  (Very similar to torrent).  I could maintain a &quot;seed&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> server, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just perform nightly backups onto a 2TB drive, and that way we  
</I>&gt;<i> could easily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have 6 months, or even a year or two of nightly backups for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disaster/archival purposes just in case any &quot;accidents&quot; do happen.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; I also think a branch for it is a good idea, but don't know why

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; the sop-refactor branch can also be branched from presence-

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; right now if Adam wants to start already. Like Melanie  
</I>&gt;<i> suggested some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; days ago in this thread.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; AFAIK this won't be a problem with git, 'cause commits are  
</I>&gt;<i> commits and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; it doesn't matter from which repo they are from, a version  
</I>&gt;<i> being a set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; of commits. So sop-refactor could first pull from presence- 
</I>&gt;<i> refactor if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; work still goes on there, and then keep pulling from master  
</I>&gt;<i> when it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; lives there, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Perhaps this is not relevant anymore if 1) can be done now,  
</I>&gt;<i> might have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; been a good idea a couple of weeks ago when presence-refactor was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; pretty
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; much done for parts that touch the scene(?). Also, I'm by no  
</I>&gt;<i> means a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; git
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; expert, so am curious to know if have misunderstood it somehow  
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; idea wouldn't work .. Melanie did say in her post that it would.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; services refactoring. It works pretty well -- gives the  
</I>&gt;<i> refactoring
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; devs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; peace of mind to leave things unstable and isolates the master  
</I>&gt;<i> branch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; from prolonged instability.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, are there any suggestions for Adam before he starts doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this? He
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sent out a document some time ago, but there wasn't a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; feedback or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; discussion. Are there any alternatives or wishes for his
