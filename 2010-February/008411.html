<PRE>Hi,

&lt;rant&gt;

skipped _everything_ from the first mention of &quot;Tortoise&quot;....

Apparently, you don't know much about the people you are so eager to
support.

I use Linux, and work exclusively on the command line. I don't use
any Windows OS at all. Also, I'd sooner be found dead that be found
using a development GUI/IDE.

Everyone here knows that. I'm vocal enough about it.

&lt;/rant&gt;

Outside of that, your generosity is appreciated, but I, for one, am
not interested in Mercurial at this time.

Also, I don't believe that we would be happy to see an external
contributor manage our repo. It is on our own servers and currently
managed by myself, an OpenSim core member.

I could probably install Mercurial myself, but I am, as already
stated, not interested in learning yet another DVCS's semantics and
toolchain.

The dust on the git migration has barely settled and we're happy for
now, even I, as the &quot;merge mistress&quot;.

I believe further treatises on Mercurial are not required at this time.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It usually takes less than 3 minutes for a developer to figure out how to
</I>&gt;<i> right click, and how to click &quot;Synchronize&quot; or &quot;Create clone&quot;.  You don't
</I>&gt;<i> need to learn or memorize any commands, just use TortoiseHG.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> automatically embedded into Windows File Explorer (or Linux) so all you have
</I>&gt;<i> to do is right click on a folder or file and you can rename, update,
</I>&gt;<i> synchronize, commit or do whatever you want with just one simple click.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Intelligent Synchronization really does make life easier for developers on
</I>&gt;<i> large collaboration projects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We don't have to do an &quot;immediate&quot; transition to Mercurial, but I can setup
</I>&gt;<i> both Git and Mercurial (concurrently) and then we can slowly move users over
</I>&gt;<i> to Mercurial (once they feel comfortable) and I can create a nice online
</I>&gt;<i> tutorial for the dev's that are unfamiliar with Merc, and also provide links
</I>&gt;<i> and a tutorial for TortoiseHG (just so dev's can see how extremely easy it
</I>&gt;<i> is, and it really requires NO learning at all).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You just right click on a file, or right click on a folder, and then select
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;merge&quot; and that's it.  The easy-to-use GUI really makes life EXTREMELY
</I>&gt;<i> simple on the dev's.  I think Mercurial is much better than Git for mobile
</I>&gt;<i> users, and a project like OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can handle the backend work (server admin, backups, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This way the dev's can just focus on developing (and writing code).  I can
</I>&gt;<i> run both a Git and a Mercurial on the same box, that way it doesn't even
</I>&gt;<i> matter what the dev's are using, both will point towards the same folders on
</I>&gt;<i> the server.  This way as dev's slowly move (and transition) from Git over to
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial, it will make life easy on them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once you start using Mercurial, I really do think you'll love it (and will
</I>&gt;<i> wonder how you ever did without it).  Mercurial has the nice user GUI from
</I>&gt;<i> TortoiseSVN (TortoiseHG for both Windows and Linux) but has the speed and
</I>&gt;<i> advanced tools (intelligent merging/synchronization) of Mercurial/Bazaar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This way we can have plenty of branches, and it takes the headache of
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining/doing manual conflicts (merges) out of the question.  This way
</I>&gt;<i> you can spend your time developing, and not dealing with the headaches of
</I>&gt;<i> merging/conflicts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can help with the implementation (and setting up a repository server, that
</I>&gt;<i> will handle both Git and Mercurial, and I supposed I could even setup a
</I>&gt;<i> Bazaar server as well if anyone really wants/needs Bazaar) but Mercurial
</I>&gt;<i> really should be the &quot;de facto&quot; choice for most of the Devs.  Once the
</I>&gt;<i> server is setup, and I can write a nice tutorial on using Mercurial, it
</I>&gt;<i> would be so much easier for the dev's (especially mobile users that are
</I>&gt;<i> using laptops, or are not connected to the internet 24/7).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Plus the speed of doing large commits is about 800-1000% faster (depending
</I>&gt;<i> on how many peers are currently online).  Since large commits are sent to
</I>&gt;<i> various peers, and then fed back to the main server (similar to a
</I>&gt;<i> torrent/peer/seed type of architecture).  This way the one main server acts
</I>&gt;<i> as a &quot;seed&quot; for the developers, and it's ALWAYS online, and it &quot;seeds&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i> network, but transfers are done P2P and also fed back to the main seed.
</I>&gt;<i>  That way the &quot;seed&quot; always has an up to date version (that is archived and
</I>&gt;<i> backed up nightly).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It may sound like a lot of work, but really it's not.  I can get it done in
</I>&gt;<i> about a day or two.  Then maybe another day for writing up tutorials.  Then
</I>&gt;<i> the dev's can transition to Mercurial at their own pace.  This way there is
</I>&gt;<i> no pressure, but the advantages of Mercurial (and intelligent merging)
</I>&gt;<i> really are what would be best for a collaborative project like this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *&gt; **I don't think we can survive another move. *
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> You just focus on developing, I can do the server build, setup Merc and Git
</I>&gt;<i> and also handle the move.  We can save the old Git for archival purposes
</I>&gt;<i> (just leave it where it's at).  I can just use the new box for Git and
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial (for the dev's) and then feed the new repository back to the old
</I>&gt;<i> Git (for an extra online archival as well).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This way the dev's can move over to the new Mercurial (at their own will),
</I>&gt;<i> and the new repository server will handle everything (and the old Git will
</I>&gt;<i> just be used for archival purposes).
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> *&gt; Also, I don't want to learn another toolchain, I want to develop.*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With TortoiseHG you don't have to learn anything.  You just point, and right
</I>&gt;<i> click.  You don't need to know any commands, don't need to do any
</I>&gt;<i> packing/repacking of Git, and don't need to do anything.  As a
</I>&gt;<i> user/developer Mercurial is by far the easiest to use for developers (with
</I>&gt;<i> the TortoiseHG client installed on your local machine).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can administer the repository, and do backups/snapshots.  That way the
</I>&gt;<i> dev's don't have to worry about anything.  If someone/something borks
</I>&gt;<i> something, then just let me know and I can just do a restore (if needed).
</I>&gt;<i>  But this way the dev's can just focus on developing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *&gt; *&gt; Melanie is the one keeping branches in sync, she has spent *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *&gt; a lot of time resolving conflicts by hand, helping out the *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *&gt; messes we get into, etc. *
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This way you don't have to deal with the headaches of manually syncing
</I>&gt;<i> branches, and you can spend your time developing instead of resolving
</I>&gt;<i> conflicts by hand.  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Intelligent merging has been around for quite a while, and using something
</I>&gt;<i> like Git or Subversion (in today's day in age) really seems a bit archaic.
</I>&gt;<i>  With tools like Mercurial and TortoiseHG you really don't need to learn (or
</I>&gt;<i> know) anything as a user/developer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just right click on the file, or right click on the folder, and
</I>&gt;<i> commit/merge.  It's really quite simple.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/">http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It really only takes a few seconds to install TortoiseHG on your local
</I>&gt;<i> machine, and then just right click in file explorer and then &quot;create clone&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and that's it.  &lt;POOF&gt; you're done.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It really is that easy.  Then when you are ready to commit, just right click
</I>&gt;<i> on a folder and then select &quot;Synchronize&quot; and &lt;POOF&gt; you're done.  It really
</I>&gt;<i> is that easy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Git is a nightmare.  I couldn't even imagine using Git for any serious
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative project.  You'd spend half of your day just handling conflicts
</I>&gt;<i> manually, and would be pulling your hair out (as an administrator) if you
</I>&gt;<i> were using archaic tools like Git.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Plus just wait a few months, and see how much Git slows down (as the project
</I>&gt;<i> grows) and just wait till you hit a &quot;git-repack&quot; error (or run out of
</I>&gt;<i> memory) and experience your first Git crash.  That's when you'll be calling
</I>&gt;<i> your system administrator for help, and wasting a day (or two) dealing with
</I>&gt;<i> the headaches of Git.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://n2.nabble.com/git-gc-out-of-memory-td4005235.html">http://n2.nabble.com/git-gc-out-of-memory-td4005235.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Experience a repository corruption, and then you'll be hugging your pillow
</I>&gt;<i> at night wondering what on earth you're going to do next.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want headaches, stick with Git.  If you want to come out of the dark
</I>&gt;<i> ages, then use Mercurial (or Bazaar).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I support developers, and I at least understand WHY everyone loves Mercurial
</I>&gt;<i> (or Bazaar).  It's the fastest/easiest/best to use from both a user
</I>&gt;<i> perspective, and from a system administrator's perspective.  If you've ever
</I>&gt;<i> maintained large repositories (on large collaborative projects) you'd
</I>&gt;<i> understand the amount of overhead (work that you must spend with Git) and
</I>&gt;<i> understand the dangers of Git (database corruption, memory errors, etc) and
</I>&gt;<i> then you'll begin to understand WHY something like Mercurial or Bazaar is
</I>&gt;<i> the safest, fastest, and best for any large collaborative project.  (A good
</I>&gt;<i> sys admin can always run both a Git, and a Mercurial on the same server,
</I>&gt;<i> just in case there are a few users that need some time to transition over to
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial, but it really only takes about 5 minutes to transition over to
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial from a user/developer standpoint, and the &quot;learning curve&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> probably under 2-3 minutes at the most and just by skimming over the
</I>&gt;<i> TortoiseHG client tutorial, it can probably answer all your questions in
</I>&gt;<i> just 2-3 minutes).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's extremely easy to see the &quot;icon overlays&quot; in File Explorer (as you're
</I>&gt;<i> working).  You'll see a nice green checkmark box on the folder (if it's
</I>&gt;<i> currently up to date and synced).  If another developer has modified a file,
</I>&gt;<i> or you have modified a file, then you will see a blue plus, then just right
</I>&gt;<i> click on the file or folder and &quot;synchronize&quot; and then all the latest
</I>&gt;<i> changes are now synchronized on your machine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For groups that want to have their own separate branches, or even do their
</I>&gt;<i> own private work, it's extremely simple and easy for users/devs to create
</I>&gt;<i> various group repositories with just a simple right click of the mouse.  It
</I>&gt;<i> makes it extremely easy for everyone to collaborate (and stay &quot;up to date&quot;)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial (or Bazaar) really does make collaboration easy.  Subversion, CVS,
</I>&gt;<i> and Git are really from the dark ages.  Once you experience a repository
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;hiccup&quot; then you'll understand what I mean.  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A user/developer wants to rename a file?  Just right-click, &quot;rename&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i> file, then &quot;synchronize&quot; it's really that easy.  Intelligent merging really
</I>&gt;<i> does make life simple (Mercurial and Bazaar are designed to do these
</I>&gt;<i> things).  Mercurial also supports file and directory copies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I could always setup Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar on a dedicated server, and
</I>&gt;<i> then just let the dev's each decide what they want to use.  I personally
</I>&gt;<i> don't care, but once the Dev's move over to Mercurial (or Bazaar) they'll
</I>&gt;<i> understand how easy it really is (and how simply it is).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Git is a headache to administer, and as a collaborative project grows you'll
</I>&gt;<i> probably waste half of your time (as a developer) with commits &amp; merging
</I>&gt;<i> headaches (with Git) but you'd be quite thankful of Mercurial (especially if
</I>&gt;<i> you synchronize regularly, like once an hour while connected to the
</I>&gt;<i> internet).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This way you're always up to date, and it's extremely fast using Mercurial.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/">http://hgbook.red-bean.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can setup a nice repository server (with Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar) that
</I>&gt;<i> way the dev's can just use Mercurial (P2P) and the server can do the
</I>&gt;<i> backups, archiving, and also feed back to the old Git Server (for online
</I>&gt;<i> archival purposes).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial is the fastest, most intelligent and by far the best (Bazaar is
</I>&gt;<i> good as well).  P2P architecture works well, and it there are plenty of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;safeguards&quot; to protect the repository (since each local machine .  This way
</I>&gt;<i> there is plenty of &quot;safeguards&quot; and redundancy.  The last thing you want is
</I>&gt;<i> to mess around with Git, and then have a repository/database corruption (or
</I>&gt;<i> out of memory/malloc failure).

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Plus with Mercurial you don't need to do all the &quot;house keeping&quot; that you
</I>&gt;<i> need to do with Git and don't need to manually repack or prune.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Git is a lot of work, and Mercurial is about 8-10 times faster than Git
</I>&gt;<i> (over time) unless you dedicate the time to manually maintaining Git.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> quite a bit of time/work and Mercurial (or Bazaar) just don't have all these
</I>&gt;<i> headaches or speed / performance / maintenance issues.  From a user's
</I>&gt;<i> standpoint, and a system administrator's standpoint, Mercurial (or Bazaar)
</I>&gt;<i> are by far the two that are the fastest, easiest, and simplest to maintain.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I could setup a Mercurial or Bazaar repository on a server (for

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to collaborate peer to peer (and I can perform backups of the main

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; server, just so we have backup, snapshot and restore points).  It will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> help
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; with the &quot;intelligent merging&quot; (for numerous dev's all working together
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; at the same time) and we can always feed copies of the Merc repository
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to the old Git and just use the old Git repository as a public archive.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Merc is peer to peer, and supports backups/mirroring, and has lots of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; features.  I can just setup a master server (with a cron job) to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; automatically pull periodic changes from your local repositories every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hour
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (for all the core dev's).  Since Mercurial maintains a complete copy of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; history in each clone (every single peer), everyone who uses Mercurial to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; collaborate on a project can potentially act as a source of &quot;backups&quot; in

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; event of a &quot;catastrophe&quot; (since there is no real &quot;centralized&quot; server).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; a central repository becomes unavailable, you simply just clone a copy of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the repository from one contributer, and pull any changes they may not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; seen from all the other contributers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Mercurial is extremely easy to perform off-site backups and remote
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mirrors.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  Plus I can set it up to perform traditional backups to tape or disk (for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; archival purposes).  This way if there are any problems, we can always
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> roll
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; back, or undo or perform disaster recovery.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; To do backups, you just use &quot;hg clone -U myrepo myrepo.bak&quot; to create a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; clone of the &quot;myrepo&quot; repository and then just perform a nightly backup,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that way automated nightly backups are being performed on the repository.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; This way you have something to roll back to, even if disaster does strike
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; dev somehow hoses everything up, which is unlikely) but regardless it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; hurts to have backups and consistent snapshots.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Mercurial maintains a complete copy of history in each clone, so it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> creates
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; numerous &quot;backups&quot; (and lots of redundancy).  By having a dedicated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; online, that will just act as a &quot;main peer&quot; at least all the other peers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; feed/seed back to the main peer anytime they are online or connected to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; internet.  The main server will simply act as a &quot;seed&quot;, and all the other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; dev's computers (that may go on or offline) will simply act as peers for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; redundancy purposes.  It's almost similar to a &quot;torrent&quot; type of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; architecture (P2P) which is good for speed of uploading/committing large
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; updates since it can pull from any of the available online peers that are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; online.  (Very similar to torrent).  I could maintain a &quot;seed&quot; server,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; just perform nightly backups onto a 2TB drive, and that way we could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; have 6 months, or even a year or two of nightly backups for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; disaster/archival purposes just in case any &quot;accidents&quot; do happen.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 3) create a 0.7 branch some time later
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I would like to propose that the sop refactoring work be done in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; branch rather than in the master branch, similar to what we did for

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; I also think a branch for it is a good idea, but don't know why wait -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; the sop-refactor branch can also be branched from presence-refactor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; right now if Adam wants to start already. Like Melanie suggested some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; days ago in this thread.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; AFAIK this won't be a problem with git, 'cause commits are commits and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; it doesn't matter from which repo they are from, a version being a set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; of commits. So sop-refactor could first pull from presence-refactor if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; work still goes on there, and then keep pulling from master when it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; lives there, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Perhaps this is not relevant anymore if 1) can be done now, might have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; been a good idea a couple of weeks ago when presence-refactor was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; pretty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; much done for parts that touch the scene(?). Also, I'm by no means a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; git
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; expert, so am curious to know if have misunderstood it somehow and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; idea wouldn't work .. Melanie did say in her post that it would.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; services refactoring. It works pretty well -- gives the refactoring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; devs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; peace of mind to leave things unstable and isolates the master branch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; from prolonged instability.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, are there any suggestions for Adam before he starts doing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this? He
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sent out a document some time ago, but there wasn't a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; feedback or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; discussion. Are there any alternatives or wishes for his proposed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; work?
