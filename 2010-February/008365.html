<PRE>Could we move this conversation closer towards the subject of OpenSim
development please?

</I>&gt;<i> *&gt; to implement an idea and then slam them with a lawsuit for *
</I>&gt;<i> *&gt; &quot;intellectual property rights infringement.&quot; *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, the &quot;DivX, Inc.&quot; folks are nothing but a team of lawyers, that sit
</I>&gt;<i> around attempting to steal/use/trademark the &quot;DivX&quot; name (which was used
</I>&gt;<i> decades earlier and even used by Circuit City, and others (with &quot;DivX&quot; DVD
</I>&gt;<i> players, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIVX_(Digital_Video_Express">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIVX_(Digital_Video_Express</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then some slick lawyers decided to try and create a new &quot;DivX, Inc.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> company, and then attempted to trademark the name (quietly) and then now
</I>&gt;<i> they just sit around suing anyone that uses the word &quot;DIVX&quot; and sue any
</I>&gt;<i> hardware or CE manufacturer that refers to a &quot;DIVX&quot; dvd player, or even any
</I>&gt;<i> type of OpenDivX or XVID (based on OpenDivx) codec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So those clown lawyers just sit around suing (and sending out threatening
</I>&gt;<i> letters) all day and that's how they make their money.  Seems to be a very
</I>&gt;<i> profitable business, just suing people (and charging &quot;royalties&quot; just to use
</I>&gt;<i> the word &quot;DivX&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd really like to see a legal challenge against them, just to see them end
</I>&gt;<i> up on their heads and watch them lose any rights to the actual DIVX name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just because they have deep pockets, and paid a large sum of money to
</I>&gt;<i> acquire the &quot;DIVX.COM&quot; website, doesn't mean they were the first to use
</I>&gt;<i> the word (or name) &quot;DIVX&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But this is how the system works, and that's how they make their money.
</I>&gt;<i>  Just suing people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They used their deep pockets to &quot;create a story&quot; about some kid they found
</I>&gt;<i> that was willing to claim to be some hacker, that had used the word &quot;Divx&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> on his pirated/hacked/illegal code (that was actually Microsoft's code) and
</I>&gt;<i> this is their concept behind their trademark claims.  (Even though the divx
</I>&gt;<i> name was widely used by hackers, and others in the community that referred
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;divx&quot; as being ripped movies done by pirates) and that name was being
</I>&gt;<i> used for almost 8-12 years prior to this silly hacker clown (who the rich
</I>&gt;<i> lawyers claim that they &quot;purchased&quot; the rights to use the name from).  What
</I>&gt;<i> a bunch of nonsense.  It's just a bunch of deep pocketed lawyers that tried
</I>&gt;<i> to create a &quot;trademark&quot; out of a common word/name, that everyone uses, just
</I>&gt;<i> so they can sue people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as products, they just use their deep pockets, and buy out some
</I>&gt;<i> small tiny company (that designs some type of codec) and then they call it
</I>&gt;<i> their own product.  It's such a joke.  DIVX isn't even a codec, it's simply
</I>&gt;<i> an open source project (OpenDivx) that is now defunct, and turned into the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;XVID&quot; project.  The DIVX lawyers just make all their money from suing
</I>&gt;<i> others, and charging royalty fees to use the &quot;DIVX&quot; name (which really isn't
</I>&gt;<i> even theirs to begin with).  That's their business model, suing others, and
</I>&gt;<i> charging to use a name that isn't even theirs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&gt; It baffles me how anyone would allow such lawsuits to make *
</I>&gt;<i> *&gt; their way through the system.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The judges and politicians are just as crooked.  Here in Chicago, we have
</I>&gt;<i> Senate seats going up for sale to the highest bidder.  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both of our last 2 governors are in prison, and our mayor is a mob boss
</I>&gt;<i> that hands out political favors to the unions in exchange for extra votes
</I>&gt;<i> (vote early, vote often, vote 2 or 3 times if you wish...).  Typical Chicago
</I>&gt;<i> Politics.  No name, no drivers license?  Are you an illegal?Have you been
</I>&gt;<i> deceased for 12 years?  Your vote still gets counted.  Over 15-20% of the
</I>&gt;<i> deceased in Chicago still vote each year.  The whole system just makes you
</I>&gt;<i> laugh.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&gt;  I can sue a fast food chain if my coffee is too hot.  Maybe *
</I>&gt;<i> *&gt; that's why they now offer &quot;iced coffee&quot;  ?*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well that's why you have the words &quot;CAUTION HOT&quot; on the lid and on the cup
</I>&gt;<i> now.  That's nothing, what about the lady who sued because she was &quot;burnt&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> by a &quot;hot pickle&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The silly nonsense we have in this country.  It's out of control.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you don't have the common sense to understand that coffee is hot, then
</I>&gt;<i> you're nearly too stupid to be human.  What ever happened to &quot;Darwinism&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>  What happened to that failed theory?  Weren't the stupid ones supposed to
</I>&gt;<i> die off or something?  Why does it seem like they always end up getting
</I>&gt;<i> elected to public office, or end up leading this country?  Or becoming a
</I>&gt;<i> governor or mayor?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&gt; her defense was that her mother was not a native English *
</I>&gt;<i> *&gt; speaker*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, she settled for a half a million, and then they had to put the words
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;CAUTION: HOT&quot; in spanish on the lids now too!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oye, what a country.  It just amazes me.  I can't believe the nonsense with
</I>&gt;<i> our judicial system.  The whole patent system really needs to be abolished
</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Chinese are reverse engineering everything they can get their hands on
</I>&gt;<i> (and laughing at us) and it seems to be working out VERY well for them.  The
</I>&gt;<i> only people hurt or affected by silly U.S. patents are the Americans and the
</I>&gt;<i> U.S. businesses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Supposed we need to move to India or China, just to get away from this
</I>&gt;<i> whole mess.  Those outside the U.S. don't seem to care about U.S. laws, and
</I>&gt;<i> they don't have to deal with (or care about) the silly nonsense of the U.S.
</I>&gt;<i> patent and court system.  The whole system is a circus.  It needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> abolished and done away with.  5 year maximum on patents (and maybe we also
</I>&gt;<i> need 4 year rotating term limits on politicians and judges).  That might
</I>&gt;<i> help fix some of the corruption problems we have.  Plus stop ALL campaign
</I>&gt;<i> contributions from special interest groups and large corporations.  I can't
</I>&gt;<i> pay off a police officer who enforces the law (because that would be
</I>&gt;<i> considered &quot;illegal&quot;), but it's perfectly ok for large corporations to use
</I>&gt;<i> campaign contributions to bribe and pay off the politicians that CREATE the
</I>&gt;<i> laws?  I guess that makes a lot of sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The whole patent system is messed up.  Give them 5 year maximums on patents
</I>&gt;<i> (on physical inventions that you can touch and hold), and after that it
</I>&gt;<i> becomes public domain.  Abolish the DMCA completely.  Source code is still
</I>&gt;<i> protected under copyright, enuff said.  :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (imho). Now companies are patenting everything just to avoid getting sued.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We see examples of this in IBM, Microsoft, etc where they patent it just to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> release it to everyone. (Anyone remember the MS-patent for &#8220;Dynamic loading
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and binding of modules&#8221; I found researching for script engine? ;) )

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Doing some researching for a patent here in Norway a few years back I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> found that it was near impossible (here) to get a patent unless what you
