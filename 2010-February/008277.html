<PRE>Many thanks to everybody who came to the event - it was really interesting to hear what people are 
doing and just to mull over the various topics in the OpenSim universe.  We had about 17 or 18 
people in the end, which I think is pretty good for an informal event (probably just as well since I 
don't think that we could have fit more people into the part of the pub that we were in).

I've posted some pictures (kindly provided by Tipton Cole of lovejoysim.com) up on my blog at

I think that we should definitely have another UK meeting, quite possibly sometime early in the 
second half of this year.
