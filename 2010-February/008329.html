Oh I see - where I read &quot;R&quot; I was always thinking of the region simulator - in fact, that's what I always assumed it stood for in that document until now (even though that doesn't make sense when I even cursorily think about it).  Some other documents have referred to UGAIM+R in the past.

Could we make it clearer that the R here refers to the resource server and not the simulator?

Okay, thanks.
