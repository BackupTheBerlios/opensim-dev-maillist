<PRE>I think it's probably missing some of the really ancient history, eg:

Mid-2006: Me/JH work out chunks of the SL protocol from Ethereal dumps
... then we were told by another outside-of-SL [Rade someone?] developer that SL has its entire protocol stored in a file called 'message_template.dat' which is just a .txt file xor'd 0x43.
Slightly later: We (mostly JH) write a basic client in C++ using BOOST.
... which turned out to be a complete unmitigated mess of thread crashes ...
Then take 2 is written in C#/.NET and gets a lot further, a lot faster.
Jan 17th-ish 2007: Darren/MW writes a simple server using libsl as the base; a lot of it is based on 'repeating' captured packet dumps in response to situations.
Jan 2Xth 2007: LL releases the client code
Jan 25-9th: MW releases his server emulator onto one of the forums, me &amp; a few others are intrigued.
Feb?: MW/lbsa/Gareth/me are the first committers
Feb-&gt;July: We rewrite the code from scratch at least 4 times.
... settling on '0.2' which forms the basis of a lot of the current architecture ...
July: SDague from IBM gets signoff to start committing code to OpenSim.
... *stuff happens* ...
Today.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello everyone!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      I know that the various versions of the viewer are derived from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Linden Lab releasing the viewer source code as open source, but what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about the server side of things?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      Is what we now call OpenSim the result of taking what we know
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the viewer and working backwards to how we presume the server pushes
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information to it?  This would be my guess.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      I don't ever recall there being any releases of the early server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source code ever made available.  This thought hit me when I started
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wondering how Open Simulator originated if the Linden Lab server
</I>&gt;<i> source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was never made publicly available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      The Open Simulator site dist directory goes back to OpenSim 0.4
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm a bit mystified.  I started messing with OpenSim at version 0.6
</I>&gt;<i> and on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      Thanks for any info offered on this topic.  I've been active in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Second Life since December 2003 and am just wanting to flesh out a
</I>&gt;<i> bit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the historical side of things, when it comes to OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> beginnings.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Len, have you seen this OpenSim history wiki page?
