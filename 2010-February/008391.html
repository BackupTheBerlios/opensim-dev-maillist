<PRE>We can, by this order:
1) merge presence-refactor into master
2) create a sop-refactor branch from master immediately after
3) create a 0.7 branch some time later

I would like to propose that the sop refactoring work be done in a 
branch rather than in the master branch, similar to what we did for the 
services refactoring. It works pretty well -- gives the refactoring devs 
peace of mind to leave things unstable and isolates the master branch 
from prolonged instability.

Also, are there any suggestions for Adam before he starts doing this? He 
sent out a document some time ago, but there wasn't a lot of feedback or 
discussion. Are there any alternatives or wishes for his proposed work?

</I>&gt;<i> My concern with branching for 0.7 release candidates immediately after the presence-refactor merge is that we won't get everybody helping to iron out the inevitable hiccups since most people follow master.  Waiting a couple of weeks for at least some of this to happen is the minimum, I feel.  Ideally, I'd like that to be longer but I know that you and other folk want to press ahead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess some of this depends on how disruptive the refactor is.  What do you think?  I'm assuming there will be breakage but perhaps I'm wrong?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, I guess you could create a separate sop-refactor branch at any point and start work there, possibly merging back to master and continuing in master once 0.7 RC has been branched.
