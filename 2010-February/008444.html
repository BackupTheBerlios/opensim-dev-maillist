...and, in OpenSim right now, there's no need for a &quot;grid server&quot;.  You
run a standalone region, and you've got your region without having some
grid server.

But it's not purely peer-to-peer, because the viewer software and the
server software are two different pieces of software.

It's just like how I can run Apache (web server) on my desktop, and use
Firefox (web client) on my desktop to look at HTML documents served by
Apache on my desktop.  It's all on my machine, and I don't have to rely
on any web hosting provider or any such to complete the transaction.
But it's not p2p in the sense that it's still a client-server
architecture.

You're confusing the architecture of the software with what people want
to do with it.  Things don't have to have a peer-to-peer architecture
for everybody to be able to roll their own.  There are advantages and
disadvantages to different architectures for different problems.  But
the fact is that OpenSim is a client/server architecture, and that's how
it is.
