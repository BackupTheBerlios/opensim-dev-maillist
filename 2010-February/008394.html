&gt;<i> We can, by this order:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) merge presence-refactor into master
</I>&gt;<i> 2) create a sop-refactor branch from master immediately after
</I>&gt;<i> 3) create a 0.7 branch some time later
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to propose that the sop refactoring work be done in a 
</I>&gt;<i> branch rather than in the master branch, similar to what we did for the
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I also think a branch for it is a good idea, but don't know why wait - 
the sop-refactor branch can also be branched from presence-refactor 
right now if Adam wants to start already. Like Melanie suggested some 
days ago in this thread.

AFAIK this won't be a problem with git, 'cause commits are commits and 
it doesn't matter from which repo they are from, a version being a set 
of commits. So sop-refactor could first pull from presence-refactor if 
work still goes on there, and then keep pulling from master when it 
lives there, etc.

Perhaps this is not relevant anymore if 1) can be done now, might have 
been a good idea a couple of weeks ago when presence-refactor was pretty 
much done for parts that touch the scene(?). Also, I'm by no means a git 
expert, so am curious to know if have misunderstood it somehow and this 
idea wouldn't work .. Melanie did say in her post that it would.

&gt;<i> services refactoring. It works pretty well -- gives the refactoring devs 
</I>&gt;<i> peace of mind to leave things unstable and isolates the master branch 
</I>&gt;<i> from prolonged instability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, are there any suggestions for Adam before he starts doing this? He 
</I>&gt;<i> sent out a document some time ago, but there wasn't a lot of feedback or 
</I>&gt;<i> discussion. Are there any alternatives or wishes for his proposed work?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My concern with branching for 0.7 release candidates immediately after the presence-refactor merge is that we won't get everybody helping to iron out the inevitable hiccups since most people follow master.  Waiting a couple of weeks for at least some of this to happen is the minimum, I feel.  Ideally, I'd like that to be longer but I know that you and other folk want to press ahead.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess some of this depends on how disruptive the refactor is.  What do you think?  I'm assuming there will be breakage but perhaps I'm wrong?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course, I guess you could create a separate sop-refactor branch at any point and start work there, possibly merging back to master and continuing in master once 0.7 RC has been branched.
