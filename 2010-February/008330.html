<PRE>That text is under a page called ROBUST.
The R is for ROBUST :-)

But please clarify anything you think it's unclear.

</I>&gt;<i> Oh I see - where I read &quot;R&quot; I was always thinking of the region simulator - in fact, that's what I always assumed it stood for in that document until now (even though that doesn't make sense when I even cursorily think about it).  Some other documents have referred to UGAIM+R in the past.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could we make it clearer that the R here refers to the resource server and not the simulator?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also, what I was really getting at was whether database migration would be automatic 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, it's automatic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, thanks.
