<PRE>Justin,
 
what was the problem with moving plug-in dll's to a separate directory?
 
Or, doesn't mono plugins support loading named plugins from an xml file, for example?
 
Wouldn't either of these solve the problem?
 
Best,
Stefan

The cause &gt; is the Mono Addins manager we're using, which writes these errors to the &gt; console if the dll doesn't contain the configuration data it's expecting.&gt; &gt; So today I looked at removing these errors. I had to follow several &gt; lines of investigation.&gt; &gt; 1. My initial thought was to move all the external libraries which are &gt; causing the problem to a separate $OPENSIM_ROOT/lib/ext directory. &gt; However, this means changes to make sure that the dlls can be found in &gt; the new directory. For a cross platform application, it's hard. On &gt; Microsoft's CLR we can simply use &lt;Probing&gt; in config files. However, &gt; Mono does appear to support this, at least according to&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Assemblies_and_the_GAC">http://www.mono-project.com/Assemblies_and_the_GAC</A>&gt; &gt; I tried it anyway, without success. Instead, the only option on Mono is &gt; to either set the MONO_PATH or put the assemblies in the Global Assembly &gt; Cache.&gt; &gt; 2. This makes things awkward, so instead I looked at moving the plugin &gt; dlls. Same problem.&gt; &gt; 3. So instead I looked at simply suppressing the messages. &gt; Unfortunately, the Mono addins code writes these messages out to the &gt; console. Although in theory you could give it an IProgressMonitor and &gt; stop this, all the classes for this (and the interface) are internal and &gt; hence not accessible. Later versions of mono-addins than the one we are &gt; using would appear to have the same problem.&gt; &gt; So although we could hack the code in 3. to remove the message (or even &gt; replace or code our own plugin solution), the fact is that we really &gt; need to have dlls in different directories eventually anyway - bin/ is &gt; already overloaded. This means I'm forced to come back to suggestion &gt; 1. Putting things in the GAC is unrealistic at this stage I think, so &gt; I'm proposing that we move all the external libraries to &gt; $OPENSIM_ROOT/lib/ext and set the MONO_PATH environmental variable to &gt; point to this directory. Under Windows, we would instead put &lt;Probing&gt; &gt; entries in the executable's config files.&gt; &gt; I tried setting MONO_PATH programatically in OpenSimMain.cs, but the set &gt; doesn't look like it is exported so the load fails. The same path works &gt; fine when exported from the command line.&gt; &gt; If we go the MONO_PATH route, then I think we could provide shell &gt; scripts for all the executables to set the path and then launch the &gt; program, even though this is a little messy. The executable itself &gt; would complain loudly if it is not on Windows and MONO_PATH is unset &gt; (which would be inconvenient for Windows mono users, though there may &gt; not be that many of them).&gt; &gt; I'm open to constructive suggestions on this, particularly from core &gt; developers.&gt; &gt; -- &gt; justincc&gt; Justin Clark-Casey&gt; <A HREF="http://justincc.wordpress.com">http://justincc.wordpress.com</A>&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
