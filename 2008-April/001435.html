<PRE>As I think about this a little more, I rapidly get to where I look at the users table in the mysql datastor for the grid.

Things that are needed for a login are pretty much all in this table. The first item, &quot;UUID&quot; is the user server perception of the identity of an avatar. Everything in other tables is referenced from users.UUID.

The grid contains a username, lastname &amp; passwordSalt. These are compared to the incoming first &amp; last and then the password is processed and compared with passwordSalt.

At that time, the entry users.homeRegion comes into play and other things such as users.userInventoryURI and users.userAssetURI become real important for a succesful login.

So, from a grid viewpoint, there already is a set of entries for each user in the mysql database. It isnt quite as simple as just having a universal avatar id. 

I have to say again, that from the viewpoint of OSGrid, we desire to stay close to the OpenSim release cycle and test and deploy svn releases at the pleasure of the core developers and the stakeholders that use OSGrid. So, this really does get back to OpenSim.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] Universal Avatar Question

Hey there Charles,

Thanks for posting this.  I would like to put out a call to grid
owners to help form the grid information services of the future.  I'm
one of the active developers of openviewer, and the more I work and
design, there more I feel the  NEED for more information from grid
owners! =)  I have a number of ideas that need the participation of
opensim.  Personally though, I believe this should be a project
outside of opensim.  Here are a few examples of things I foresee us
needing in the immediate future:

- ability to autoregister an avatar on a grid
- ability to get information about the grid: descriptions, image/icon,
tags of what type of content ( sex, language, interests, etc)
- ability to get some measure of lag between the client and server
- ability to get population and logged on information of avatars externally

These things COULD all be within opensim, but what I would like to do,
is create a new project.  I've started a project on google code called
&quot;thirdlife&quot; where I am going to focus my efforts on grid information
services.   If any of you all are grid owners, I'd like to get a hold
of you to try to figure out what information exactly you all are
looking to expose to users.  Thanks!
