<PRE>I also don't know much about the details of realXtend's design on this, 
I only know the general goal.

My thoughts about this are as follows: we want organizations to control 
who visits their regions, no question about that. There will be 
organizations (like role-playing games, for example) that will require 
accounts with them for people to play, and that's perfectly fine. This 
also happens on the web: if you want to &quot;play&quot; in facebook, you need to 
get an account with them.  But there will be organizations who will 
welcome visits from accounts in other worlds, or accounts served from 
&quot;identity services&quot;, which don't exist yet. As I said, from where I 
stand, I see this as a *major* need. I'm working with a lot of people 
who want to use virtual worlds like that. They want to build useful 
services in 3D, and they need people to visit. If people need to get 
accounts with them, the whole idea stops in its tracks at the station -- 
or else they do it in Linden Lab's grid.

I don't see any need for *automatic* selection of one of several 
possible accounts associated with a real world person -- that's a level 
of sophistication that's unnecessary at this point and in the forseable 
future. I think that goal is blurring the much simple things that can be 
done relatively easily.

What I see  is the need for identity services that are independent of 
any particular grid. Here's the usage scenario:

1. People get accounts with one (or more) identity services. For 
example, I (Crista Lopes) get an account in an hypothetical identity 
service provided by VeriSignVW; that account is called 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">crista at verisignvw.com.</A> Besides my ID, VeriSigVW gives me storage space 
for my <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">crista at verisignvw.com</A> inventory.
2. I login to some virtual world, say OSGrid, using that account. OSGrid 
must accept avatars from VeriSignVW. Maybe OSGrid is more generic than 
that; maybe it accepts accounts from any identity service that complies 
with a standard ID protocol, TBD.
3. As I visit regions in OSGrid, all comms with inventory and user go to 
VeriSignVW.
4. At some point I want to visit some other grid, say IBM's public grid. 
I TP to it under my representation which is <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">crista at verisignvw.com</A>
5. The IBM grid must accept avatars from VeriSignVW. If it does, swoosh! 
there I go. If it doesn't, I can't TP to it. I must logout, and login 
under some IBM account. The extra work of automatically selecting 
between my VeriSignVW account and my IBM account is completely 
unnecessary at this point. I can do that manually. But having the 
ability to surf under one single account between grids that accept that 
3rd-party accounts is a major step forward.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm not so sure you should alway have the same avatar for everything. 
</I>&gt;<i> Or should completely cut the &quot;region servers&quot; out of the whole 
</I>&gt;<i> process. If I teleport to a region that has a role playing game, maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> my avatar should automatically change (at least clothes, but maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> body as well) to fit into that game. So the region has to be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> have some say over the avatar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have the same sort of thoughts about inventory. While it should not 
</I>&gt;<i> be centralised, the regions do need to be able to (with permission) do 
</I>&gt;<i> certain things, like maybe a region gives you a extra set of folders 
</I>&gt;<i> for use in that region, but they disappear when you leave it. I am 
</I>&gt;<i> also not sure there should be just one inventory set for each user. 
</I>&gt;<i> Why not a number of sub sets that can be combined etc. Maybe the 
</I>&gt;<i> region could restrict access to only a certain set, which might be a 
</I>&gt;<i> set that it provides, when in that region; no space ships when in that 
</I>&gt;<i> serious business region.. Inventory really needs to swap to a more url 
</I>&gt;<i> based system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also we need to remember not everything will be interconnected. There 
</I>&gt;<i> will be some applications (or possible grids) that want to be separate 
</I>&gt;<i> from everything else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I don't think we should be forcing any centralised system on 
</I>&gt;<i> people. And yes from what I've read, I actually think the realxtend 
</I>&gt;<i> avatar system sounds too centralised, but that could be because I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't know enough details of what is planned. I'm not saying its 
</I>&gt;<i> wrong, it just doesn't fit all possible uses. So we need things to at 
</I>&gt;<i> least be modular.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having said all that, of course I think a lot of people and 
</I>&gt;<i> applications will want to have shared resources like these. Just we 
</I>&gt;<i> have to be careful in how they are implemented. And for opensim at 
</I>&gt;<i> least, that should be a open process/design that everyone can be part of.

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; What happened to realXtend's &quot;avatar system&quot;? Is it being
</I>&gt;<i>     integrated
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; with OpenSim?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Short answers. I don't know, and no. The process for code coming into
</I>&gt;<i>     OpenSim is to put a patch in mantis. I haven't seen any proposed
</I>&gt;<i>     patches in this area in mantis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; From where I stand, that, or something like that, is a major
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; architectural requirement for virtual worlds to get serious.
</I>&gt;<i>     Without the
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; ability for people to get an identity+inventory that they can port
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; around through different organization's grids, this is not going
</I>&gt;<i>     to be
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; that useful. I see a lot of interest from organizations to set
</I>&gt;<i>     up their
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; own virtual worlds under their control (so, their own grid'ed
</I>&gt;<i>     regions),
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; but if people have to get accounts with them to visit, this is
</I>&gt;<i>     just not
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; going to work for serious usages - period.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Hence you've created the paradox. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * We want everything connected
</I>&gt;<i>     * We don't want to trust a single authoritative source for info
</I>&gt;<i>     (otherwise you'd be on Second Life)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Honestly, this is a hard problem to solve, and one that seems a bit
</I>&gt;<i>     beyond the current scope. That being said, implementations and
</I>&gt;<i>     research
</I>&gt;<i>     in this area which work with OpenSim are always welcomed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; I understand there's a ton of stability work to be done, but this
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; particular architectural decision is really important, even
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; (especially?) at this early stage; we all trust stability will
</I>&gt;<i>     happen
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; over time.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Is there anything that I can do to boost the efforts in that
</I>&gt;<i>     direction,
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; besides sending this email?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Sample peer based User services that allow cross talk would be useful.
</I>&gt;<i>     The moral equivalent of OpenID for virtual worlds (because you
</I>&gt;<i>     need more
</I>&gt;<i>     than just what openid provides).
