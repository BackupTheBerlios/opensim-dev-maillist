...honestly, I'm not sure why people aren't looking at the client as
being the source of the inventory that their avatars use in the VWs --
let the servers cache the client inventory for avatars, not the other
way around.  (Why everyone's so hard-up on the concept of a central
server for everything is beyond me... if you buy a license to use
something, you should have the ability to carry it with you.)

On a related note, I'm going to assume that the world still isn't
ready for my approach to copyrighted material management and
enforcement, so I'm going to sit on it a bit longer.  Even though it
doesn't rely on making bits harder to copy, fits MUCH better with the
traditional legal contours of copyright protection than DRM, is much
simpler to implement than any DRM system in the world, and doesn't
rely on any cryptographic secrets -- or any secrets at all.
