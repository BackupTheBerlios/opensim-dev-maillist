I think you have captured the technical consequences of having multiple 
inventory roots, but to resolve the issue we need to properly understand 
the whys and wherefores of multiple roots. Why do avatars have multiple 
roots? what are the functional differentiators? I.e. why does it matter 
that we stop at the first? I was recently looking through the new 
inventory/capabilities code and had had the same thoughts as you 
expressed. It seems to me that there can be only one (apologies to the 
Highlander) root directory. Given the information that is in it, there is 
no reson for this directory to exist outside of an extant presence, and 
all of the other hierarchies should exist as (apparent) subordinates to 
this directory. This then raises questions of convenience as a result of 
having something that is an unnecessary empty layer for the majority of 
inventories where only one hierarchy exists; there are a number of ways to 
address that such as collapsing any monotonous hierarchies. I assume the 
overwhelmingly most important goal is that at the end of the day the 
inventory is complete, predictable, and unambiguous.

Best regards

[Opensim-dev] multiple, empty, root inventory folders






The situation exists where a number of avatars have multiple root 
inventory folders on OSGrid, and I suspect on other grids as well. One of 
the implications is that this obscures the inventory as our search stops 
at the first root inventory folder it finds, that is the first one whose 
parentFolderId == zeroes.

Having a query to identify and then remove completely empty root inventory 
folders might help make this situation better, but it involves a fairly 
complex mysql query that is currently beyond my abilities. I am hoping 
someone could help out a little here with a query that can be used to 
identify multiple root inventory folders in a grids mysql database and a 
query to would allow them to be deleted, perhaps one by one, that would be 
fine.

This query involves finding all those avatars with inventoryfolders 
entries where more then one parentFolderID is zeroes.
