<PRE>A week ago, the CentralGrid folks changed their regions from SQLite touse a centralized MySQL datastor and had a problem. I got theirregions back to SQLite and everything worked again.

Yesterdaythe UCIGrid folks tried to update past r4058 and had a similar problem.The problem is an inability to bring up any regions and getting theerror &quot;unknown master user UUID&quot;.

During all of this, OSGrid is working pretty well.

I can tellyou that some regions on OSGrid are running SQLite (plazas, Yang, Celt,'moons' to name a few) and others are running MySQL (Nebadon's,daTwitch's) and we did that intentionally to test both datastores.

But,heres the deal. There is no centralized datastor for *any* region onOSGrid. The UGAI MySQL database stands on its own and contains theusers, regions, assets, inventory and web site folders.

Noregion talks to the UGAI MySQL except through the UGAI. Each region hasits own standalone MySQL or SQLite datastor. Another point. I did runthe plazas on the UGAI server for a while, but I had some trouble withthe gridserver freezing and a couple of months ago, I moved the plazasto our backup server and they have been running much better ever since.

Itvery well may be that we have uncovered a problem. If so, this isgoing to be tough to close the loop as we dont have that use case setup anywhere.

There are 4 of the core team thathave console access to OSGrid and generally just watch over ourshoulder or read entries in the MySQL datastore. We did that in order tohave a way for our core developers insight into the dynamics of arunning grid.

But, since OSGrid is a heterogeneous grid,meaning, all the regions are *elsewhere*. That is, none are on the same lansegment as the UGAI, all the regions datastores are local to theregions and not connected to the UGAI except through the external UGAIinterfaces.

Hmmm. If true, how arewe going to figure this one out for grids that are more homogeneous,that is, the regions are tied more closely to the UGAI then on OSGrid.
