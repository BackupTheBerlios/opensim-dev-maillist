<PRE>I think it highly desirable to envision the opensim project in the terms
that lulurun has used; to paraphrase, a set of protocols and an associated
API.

I for one am delighted to see implementations in alternate languages coming
to the fore; c# has been shown to be anything but optimal for this
application area (IMHO) and alternatives are beneficial in a variety of
ways, from providing practical alternatives to performance baselines.

I am so committed to this notion that I have undertaken the study of Erlang
in the interest of creating an implementation of opensim in that language,
which in my estimation is a far more suitable implementation language than
either perl or c#.

This of course represents only my personal perspective, and perhaps only
incidentally that of a few others; and while what is a solution for me or
lulurun is not necesarily the solution for everyone, every effort should be
made to encourage such efforts in the interest of providing options to the
implementor of regions and grids.

At the very least, every effort should be made not to discourage such
projects.

For me, I say leave the perl code right where it is, and embrace this turn
of events with the same sort of technical vigor and optimism that has been
typical of this project in the past.

Just my 0.02$L

Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One problem with having two sets of UGAI is that it makes changes harder

</I>&gt;<i> to change the perl ones too or break those. And as they are in our svn, we
</I>&gt;<i> would most likely getting people complaining they are broke. And this is a
</I>&gt;<i> big factor in my mind as over the next few weeks there is a chance that I
</I>&gt;<i> will be able to do some work on the grid servers/protocols.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I'm with Stefan on this one, in that I'm all for there being different
</I>&gt;<i> implementations of the UGAI's but think for now we should only have one in
</I>&gt;<i> the svn other wise it is just going to lead to confusion/problems if one
</I>&gt;<i> implementation is broke because of some change to the other. So think other
</I>&gt;<i> implementations should be outside the svn.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We do understand that not everyone wants to use the standard c# versions

</I>&gt;<i> we (myself and Stefan) have wrote our own ASP version of some of the backend

</I>&gt;<i> In that not everyone would want to run ASP servers, so we think at this time

</I>&gt;<i> was other versions in svn that they were breaking by doing those changes.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    .ExternalClass DIV {;}     I am really puzzled about this new Perl
</I>&gt;<i> UGAI and it leads to a number of questions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are we going to have two sets of servers for grid mode? One written in
</I>&gt;<i> C# and the other written in Perl?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Will we have each of them with the same features? Will we abandon the C#
</I>&gt;<i> UGAI servers?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How will we seperate out issues between regions on a grid and the grid
</I>&gt;<i> servers if some grids run with Perl UGAI and some run with C# UGAI?
