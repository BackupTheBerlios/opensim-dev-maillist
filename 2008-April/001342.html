<PRE>The recent issue where objects weren't appearing in the 1.19.1.4 client 
agent inventory was due to the fact that libsecondlife.AssetType for an 
object was wrongly returning  &quot;primitive&quot; rather than &quot;object&quot;.  Could 
someone in the know upgrade/patch our libsecondlife.dll to resolve this 
properly?  The version in opensim-libs doesn't appear to have this 
issue, so I have to assume we're now out of step with what's in there 
(which we shouldn't be).

I imagine we want the version just before libsecondlife required 
mono-1.9, possibly with that bug patched.

I'd take care of this myself but I can't directly commit that code due 
to current company restrictions.

Thanks in advance, anyone :-)
