</I>
By decoupling from the user server, we've coupled AppearanceModule to
DataMapper, and are managing database connections in a RegionModule,
which I think is a worse approach.  

m_scene.CommsManager.UserService.GetUserProfile(id) seems
like a much better approach.  We could just add .GetUserAppearance and
friends to it.

&gt;<i> As I said in my last email, there could also be some bots/NPC's that
</I>&gt;<i> don't have userprofiles. And also I think there is a chance that scene
</I>&gt;<i> presences are created (and the appearance fetched) before the user
</I>&gt;<i> profiles are. But can't be sure of that without looking deeper in the
</I>&gt;<i> code.
</I>
If an NPC exists in the environment, I would think it would have a
profile (it needs that for Name for instance).

&gt;<i> But anyway as long as we went through the avatar appearance factory
</I>&gt;<i> module concept to fetch the appearance that was attached to the user
</I>&gt;<i> profile. Then I guess there is nothing stopping it. Just seems a
</I>&gt;<i> coupling that isn't needed.
</I>
Yes, that's probably strictly true.  Actually, we don't really need it
hanging off of UserProfile.  What I really meant was that
AvatarAppearance was an object that existed, and was fetchable/updatable
from the UserService by UUID.

&gt;<i> I am very strongly of the opinion that we need to keep the factory
</I>&gt;<i> module concept. So that a different module could be used. Different
</I>&gt;<i> regions/applications might want a completely different approach to how
</I>&gt;<i> the appearance of the avatars are handled. Like a game might want to
</I>&gt;<i> randomly just give each user one of a set of preset avatars.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But with this factory module. We can actually fetch the appearance
</I>&gt;<i> from where ever we want, including the userprofile if it is decided.
</I>
If we move the default storage back into UserService, I don't think
we'll have an issue here.  UserService will just support a persistance
model for appearance, should anyone want to use that.  How appearance is
created remains in the region modules.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
