<PRE>I couldn't agree more.

My personal view of a project like OpenSim is that it is a reference
implementation of the OpenSim protocol(s). As such, it shouldn't concern
itself with containing every single implementation of the various
servers.  

I really like the idea of having a wiki page listing &quot;OpemSim Protocol
based Projects&quot; that end users can pick from. the opensimulator.org
website could focus on protocol specifics, and linking to specific
implementations with the core C# implementation downplayed as just a
reference implementation that may or may not be as stable or fast as 3rd
party implementations and utilities.

This would also make it possible for us to take the add-in modules like
the recent bad behaving interface demo module and keep them in a
seperate &quot;official add-ons&quot; repository that people can overlay on the
core report. How that overlay is acheived can be worked out later. ;)

I have to agree with Charles on the OSGrid concerns. I say leave it
using just the C# core reference implementation so it's a solid known
setup to test against. If we really want to semi-officially suport the
alternatives, then OSGrid can negotiate hosting of secondary testing
grids with the various implementations if the alternative creator
doesn't have a place to run their servers (I'm making an assumption of
resource availability here, which may or may not be possible).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's still in a state of considerable flux (this is Alpha code!). Trying 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to formalize at this stage would considerably slow down development.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have to agree with Michael that we shouldn't have alternative 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementations in our own svn tree - it will cause considerable 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; confusion as to what OpenSim officially supports and what it doesn't.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And hypothetically, if Lulurun goes away for whatever reason 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (hypothetically!) the onus to maintain it as an 'official' alternative 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would fall on the OpenSim developers.  Whether the Perl alternative 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should really be the reference (not necessarily the best) implementation 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is another argument, I think.  I can see pros and cons for both.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Having said that, it sounds like Lulurun is willing to maintain the code 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to match changes in the protocol.  Even if the code doesn't live inside 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the OpenSim tree, I believe we could make an effort on an informal basis 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to advertise and discuss proposed protocol changes before the fact 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (unless the changes are very large, in which case things would have to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be done post-facto).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, we should have links to alternate implementations somewhere on the
</I>&gt;<i> wiki.  Honestly, I suspect that we'll end up with UGAI in at least perl,
</I>&gt;<i> python, ASP.NET, java, and ruby by the end of the year that people are
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining.  That is a strength, not a weakness.
