</I>&gt;<i>  Indeed. However its important to note that since OpenSim is alpha
</I>&gt;<i>  quality software, there is just no way anyone should be thinking OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i>  will give them high availability -- yet.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
I wholeheartedly agree.  The two goals (cleanliness and insight) are
not mutually incompatible.

Alpha-time is the time when the greatest insight is needed into how
the designs behave.  If a given design causes problems that violate
the constraints of the environment, some aspect of the design needs to
be changed BEFORE the code goes to beta (or worse, release).

If you like, you can think of it as a means of obtaining test
information from long-running tests, as opposed to unit-testing single
discrete units of functionality.  (Not that OpenSim has much of that,
either.)  If you can create a clean design for integrating run-time
gathering of statistics, then you've solved one of the main problems
that eventually integrates alpha-quality code and design into beta or
release software.

I'm specifically thinking OSgrid with my suggestion -- but there's no
reason it couldn't be made into a developmental tool to figure out
when and how things break when the code is changed.  It also allows
for useful identification of when problems were introduced.  (In fact,
since OSgrid is OpenSim's largest-scale and longest-running tester,
such insight being made available can only help speed development.)
