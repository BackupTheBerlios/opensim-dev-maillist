<PRE>Dear Sean:

It seems like a good idea to me. Perhaps we could do it a sub-project at a time, that is by the .dll's and .exe's defined as projects in the windows C# IDE.

I would be happy to work through the drudge part. I might like a little consultation from time to time, but if you would like, I am happy to volunteer to move this one through the code base.

Charles

Subject: [Opensim-dev] Thoughts on UUID

One of the things that I ran into today is how many places LLUUID ends
up in our code base from libsecondlife.  While not always a problem it
does lead to some oddness.

 * libsecondlife is a required link for lots of classes that just need a
   UUID
 * LLUUID is not serializable, which causes us some pain
 * LLUUID has changed a couple of times in the past, causing us grief

It seems like it would be a good idea to replace LLUUID as much as
possible with our own OSUUID (I put a sample in
OpenSim/Framework/OSUUID.cs).  It would look very similar to LLUUID
(which is basically just a wrapper on System.Guid), but be
[Serializable].  It would also mean that we could drop a lot of
libsecondlife references.  I think that would be required for Stefan's
OpenSim.Model idea.

Thoughts?

This will be a lot of work if we decide to do it, and a couple of days
of brutal instability to do a swap out like this, as we can't get rid of
LLUUID entirely (we need it when we get to packet generation I think).

Discussion on this one would be appreciated.  Definitely wouldn't want
to make any changes like this without full agreement from everyone.

   -Sean

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
