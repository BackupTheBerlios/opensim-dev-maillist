<PRE>Hi,

Yes, the module has been thought out as a generic facility for exposing 
2D region data into the web. It can be used for other things, not just 
the specific use I'm making of it with my Metaverse Ink hat. I'm glad to 
see you saw the more fundamental thing going on here in spite of my 
incomplete explanation.

I'm perfectly fine with other people changing it for the better, and I 
could only hope that others see uses in it. Don't worry about changes 
breaking my indexer here, I'll adjust rapidly. (And if it breaks 
something really bad, I'll go and hunt the culprit, pin him down, and 
beat him up like a red-haired step-child :-)

As I told Charles before, I'd be honored if the module goes into the 
main distribution; I see this functionality of 2D data exposure as core 
functionality for better integration with the existing web. But I'm an 
outsider and don't know a lot about the context of the project.

Diva / Crista

</I>&gt;<i> Having read Diva's e-mail and briefly looked through the code, I support

</I>&gt;<i> such as search.  From a casual look, it seems that the module is written 
</I>&gt;<i> with this generic aim in mind, rather than for search specific 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I would just like to say that I think that by inserting this 
</I>&gt;<i> code directly into the OpenSim codebase, this gives developers license - 
</I>&gt;<i> whether they are core or by way of accepted patch - to change its 
</I>&gt;<i> output, possibly at short notice.  Since the aim of exposing region data 
</I>&gt;<i> is generic, we may come upon a better way of representing output, 
</I>&gt;<i> particularly at this alpha stage.  We might feel that it would be better 
</I>&gt;<i> to change this generic module directly, rather than establish another 
</I>&gt;<i> parallel module.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this happened, it would be up to people making use of the module to 
</I>&gt;<i> adapt to the changes, rather than for a lot of negotiation to happen up 
</I>&gt;<i> front before any changes are made.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't necessarily think this is likely, but I believe it is a 
</I>&gt;<i> possibility that Diva and Kmesithax need to be aware of.  I think this 
</I>&gt;<i> is one of the costs associated with making this a core module (as well 
</I>&gt;<i> as the necessity of non-core developers changing it by patch).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If Diva and Kmesithax are happy to live with that, then I, for one, 
</I>&gt;<i> welcome and commend their efforts :-)
