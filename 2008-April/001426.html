<PRE>I'm still unsure what you meant about the appearance shouldn't be part of the land.

But avatar appearance is very much a scene related thing, its basically the definition of a 3d object...the avatar. Its not really the same thing as Agent/User profile/data. Thats more account data.

So while I don't really care how on the backend it is stored. I very much think it should be on the region side something like it is now. And kept separate from agent data. Also we need to remember that bots might have a avatar (with appearance) but no userprofile. The bots in simple module for instance.

I could well be completely miss-understanding what you meant. But I think there is a danger here of trying to make connections between two bits of data that should be handled on the region side in different ways. I think we should actually most likely be breaking things up even further. And break up that mess of OpenSim.Framework.Communications. So many different things have been lumped together in there, just because they connect to the backend servers in some way. 

If we had a common easy way for any module to communicate with the backend servers then we could separate so much more.

To clarify, what I really want to do is make Apperance like Profile, and
the AvatarAppearance Region Module work more like AvatarProfilesModule
in getting the user server to save the information back for it.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
