<PRE>I'm perfectly fine with the output format changing. I never wrote up a full specification or DTD, and for a while I was considering using LLSD formatted output. I was also considering writing a generic data marshalling framework since right now our data collector classes are mainly &quot;copy this variable from this object and put it in this XML tag&quot; iterated over a collection. But I was having doubts about how generic it could be while still being useful.

P.S. you'll also notice that you can automatically load new collectors into the DataSnapshot module by creating a class derived from IDataSnapshotProvider and implementing the required methods. Also the class has to be in the same assembly. Eventually I wanted to have other modules be able to add to the DataSnapshot output as well, but since we haven't stabilized the output format just yet I don't think it's a good idea to do so right now.

+1

Having read Diva's e-mail and briefly looked through the code, I support 
the idea that this patch should be included as a core module.  The 
exposure of region information directly to the internet could enhance 
integration with lots of other services, as well as allowing facilities 
such as search.  From a casual look, it seems that the module is written 
with this generic aim in mind, rather than for search specific 
functionality.

However, I would just like to say that I think that by inserting this 
code directly into the OpenSim codebase, this gives developers license - 
whether they are core or by way of accepted patch - to change its 
output, possibly at short notice.  Since the aim of exposing region data 
is generic, we may come upon a better way of representing output, 
particularly at this alpha stage.  We might feel that it would be better 
to change this generic module directly, rather than establish another 
parallel module.

If this happened, it would be up to people making use of the module to 
adapt to the changes, rather than for a lot of negotiation to happen up 
front before any changes are made.

I don't necessarily think this is likely, but I believe it is a 
possibility that Diva and Kmesithax need to be aware of.  I think this 
is one of the costs associated with making this a core module (as well 
as the necessity of non-core developers changing it by patch).

If Diva and Kmesithax are happy to live with that, then I, for one, 
welcome and commend their efforts :-)
