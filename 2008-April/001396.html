Yeh, the option to do SHA1 UUID generation is a good idea.  I had
actually proposed this on IRC and in Zero's office hours a month or so
ago.  I'd definitely like to implement a SHA1 based UUID generator for
assets as that could simplify our stock content quite a bit.

&gt;<i> We have at realXtend web site some free assets already available and we

I think this has a lot of possibilities.  Something that would be nifty
is a standard format for external content repositories, so it would be
easy to point the sim or asset server at them to pull down automatically
and put into their environment.  People could then publish their freely
available assets for the taking merely by structuring them in the right
ways.

&gt;<i> Or is the viewer generating the UID? That would then require some changes to
</I>&gt;<i> the client and would break the compatibility with SL Viewer..
</I>
I believe this whole thing can be done server side.  But someone can
connect me if I'm wrong.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
