<PRE>I'm been thinking and prototyping about some improvements on the grid servers/protocols. 

One of my aims is to try to separate the network code more from the logic code. So am thinking of what I'm calling a Channel and servlet system. 

A servlet is just a class that performs some service. I'm thinking more in terms of breaking up the current servers into smaller services/servlets. 

So then we have a collection of servlets that do the various functions that the current servers do (except I'm not including the asset server in this as think that is best kept to a proper REST resource based system).

Then we come to the channel, maybe this is a bad term for what I'm thinking, but anyway. The channel has two (or three) parts, the sender/receivers, which are responsible for the serialising/deserialising of the messages/datagrams, and also of sending it to the correct url. To find the url that a message should be sent to, the other part of the channel is responsible. I'm currently thinking of this as a basic central hash table service, that just keeps track of the servlets that are registered on that channel and the url of the endpoint that they are one. Of course the idea with the channel is to keep the code separate from the service logic, so how the servlet tracking is done is up to the implementation. 

 While each servlet could actually have its own endpoint/channel receiver, I'm thinking more of a collection of them sharing a endpoint. So normally maybe only one endpoint per server instance. 

So all a channel really is: Is a managed collection of known services and the url they can be reached at. Plus the code for de/serialising the messages in the format that channel uses. 

The third component is the Router service. Each server instance would have one of these, that is tasked with routing the messages to and from the channel endpoint to the correct servlet.  A router could be connected to more than one channel.

Again a basic concept. The task is just to keep track of servlets in that instance, to know what channels they should be receiving messages from. To be able to route a message from a servlet to a channel; either a particular channel, or the servlet might just say any channel that has a particular type of service registered on it. Also the router should be able to do internal routing...from one servlet to another that is in the same instance. 


I'm also thinking that the region servers will have such a router and be registered on a channel(s). And then region modules could send and receive messages the same way.

My thoughts and actually my requirements for some other ideas. Is to have a dynamic modular system. That keeps the network code completely separate from the services logic. I really think that the current servers are too err monolithic and really group together a bunch of services that are separate. I don't mean they should always be on separate servers, just the code should be separated more and more modular. 

So my thoughts are lots of smaller services/servlets. And once we do that, it could lead to lots of url having to be kept track of by each other servlet if we used the current approach. So thats why I think the network code , including url management/tracking should be completely separate. 
This also I think/hope could help with scaling things. In that as the servlets can be grouped together as needed (and even moved around the server instances). Then a very small grid might only want to run one backend server instance that had all the servlets that it needs running. While a much larger grid might have a server instance for each servlet, and maybe more than one servlet of each type running.

 Also its possible that we could use the same servlets in standalone mode, as they would just use the internal routing function of the routing service.

Another benefit is it helps to make the whole thing more customizable. In a number of different ways. One of those ways is something that I've done some prototyping of. Which is as the servlets and router classes have no network code in at all. Its a simple task to write different versions of the channel receivers/senders for say a ASP.net implementation. 

There are still a number of things that need more thought. But thats a general overview of my ideas
