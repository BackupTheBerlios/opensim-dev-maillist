<PRE>One of the things that I ran into today is how many places LLUUID ends
up in our code base from libsecondlife.  While not always a problem it
does lead to some oddness.

 * libsecondlife is a required link for lots of classes that just need a
   UUID
 * LLUUID is not serializable, which causes us some pain
 * LLUUID has changed a couple of times in the past, causing us grief

It seems like it would be a good idea to replace LLUUID as much as
possible with our own OSUUID (I put a sample in
OpenSim/Framework/OSUUID.cs).  It would look very similar to LLUUID
(which is basically just a wrapper on System.Guid), but be
[Serializable].  It would also mean that we could drop a lot of
libsecondlife references.  I think that would be required for Stefan's
OpenSim.Model idea.

Thoughts?

This will be a lot of work if we decide to do it, and a couple of days
of brutal instability to do a swap out like this, as we can't get rid of
LLUUID entirely (we need it when we get to packet generation I think).

Discussion on this one would be appreciated.  Definitely wouldn't want
to make any changes like this without full agreement from everyone.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
