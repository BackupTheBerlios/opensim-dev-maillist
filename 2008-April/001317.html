<PRE>One aspect is that we need to foster a spawning culture; we can't have one project that everybody's trying to add to to it make suit everybodys need; that's just not how internet development works.
 
We need to get people to publish code on their own wikis, spawn separate sourceforge or berlios projects; an we will link to them, recommend some, even have some official add-on repository (think firefox)
 
but the CORE repository has to be focused on one thing, and one thing only: Getting a WORKING, TIGHT, STABLE reference implementation of a set of MODULAR SERVICES and STANDARD PROTOCOLS.
I think we're approaching our limit for how much code should be in that CORE repository. From now on, we need to spawn spin-offs.

As such, it shouldn't concern&gt; itself with containing every single implementation of the various&gt; servers. &gt; &gt; I really like the idea of having a wiki page listing &quot;OpemSim Protocol&gt; based Projects&quot; that end users can pick from. the opensimulator.org&gt; website could focus on protocol specifics, and linking to specific&gt; implementations with the core C# implementation downplayed as just a&gt; reference implementation that may or may not be as stable or fast as 3rd&gt; party implementations and utilities.&gt; &gt; This would also make it possible for us to take the add-in modules like&gt; the recent bad behaving interface demo module and keep them in a&gt; seperate &quot;official add-ons&quot; repository that people can overlay on the&gt; core report. How that overlay is acheived can be worked out later. ;)&gt; &gt; I have to agree with Charles on the OSGrid concerns. I say leave it&gt; using just the C# core reference implementation so it's a solid known&gt; setup to test against. If we really want to semi-officially suport the&gt; alternatives, then OSGrid can negotiate hosting of secondary testing&gt; grids with the various implementations if the alternative creator&gt; doesn't have a place to run their servers (I'm making an assumption of&gt; resource availability here, which may or may not be possible).&gt; &gt; On Thu, 2008-04-03 at 10:04 -0400, Sean Dague wrote:&gt; &gt; On Thu, Apr 03, 2008 at 02:27:07PM +0100, Justin Clark-Casey wrote:&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm very much in favour of the idea of alternative implementations of &gt; &gt; &gt; the UGAI protocols.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As James, has suggested, in other circumstances it would be good to &gt; &gt; &gt; formally write down the protocol and advertise and discuss changes &gt; &gt; &gt; beforehand. However, the problem is, as Michael and Sean say, is that &gt; &gt; &gt; it's still in a state of considerable flux (this is Alpha code!). Trying &gt; &gt; &gt; to formalize at this stage would considerably slow down development.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have to agree with Michael that we shouldn't have alternative &gt; &gt; &gt; implementations in our own svn tree - it will cause considerable &gt; &gt; &gt; confusion as to what OpenSim officially supports and what it doesn't. &gt; &gt; &gt; And hypothetically, if Lulurun goes away for whatever reason &gt; &gt; &gt; (hypothetically!) the onus to maintain it as an 'official' alternative &gt; &gt; &gt; would fall on the OpenSim developers. Whether the Perl alternative &gt; &gt; &gt; should really be the reference (not necessarily the best) implementation &gt; &gt; &gt; is another argument, I think. I can see pros and cons for both.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Having said that, it sounds like Lulurun is willing to maintain the code &gt; &gt; &gt; to match changes in the protocol. Even if the code doesn't live inside &gt; &gt; &gt; the OpenSim tree, I believe we could make an effort on an informal basis &gt; &gt; &gt; to advertise and discuss proposed protocol changes before the fact &gt; &gt; &gt; (unless the changes are very large, in which case things would have to &gt; &gt; &gt; be done post-facto).&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, we should have links to alternate implementations somewhere on the&gt; &gt; wiki. Honestly, I suspect that we'll end up with UGAI in at least perl,&gt; &gt; python, ASP.NET, java, and ruby by the end of the year that people are&gt; &gt; maintaining. That is a strength, not a weakness.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Sean&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; &gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; &gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; &gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
