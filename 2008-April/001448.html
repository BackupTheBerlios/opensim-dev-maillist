<PRE>I have no problem with the GetUserAppearance. But with the current module, we didn't actually couple Appearance to the datamapper. That was just one implementation of a Appearance Module meant for standalone mode. And I still think we will need something like that for standalone mode. 

The idea is to have different avatar appearance factory modules depending on how the data would be fetched/created. It really isn't that much different to the current Grid Services. Where we have versions to use local databases or ones to communicate with remote servers. 

I do however not really agree that NPC's should always have to have a profile on the grid servers or anywhere. If that was a local region NPC that never moved out of that region, then by forcing profiles we are just making things more complicated.

By decoupling from the user server, we've coupled AppearanceModule to
DataMapper, and are managing database connections in a RegionModule,
which I think is a worse approach.  

m_scene.CommsManager.UserService.GetUserProfile(id) seems
like a much better approach.  We could just add .GetUserAppearance and
friends to it.
