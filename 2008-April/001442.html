Honestly, I universal avatar would be best served by a seperate open
source project at the moment.

I support Charles' desire for OSGrid to stay a direct build off the
OpenSim tree at this point.  OSGrid is our largest source of testing,
and right now, given how fluid data structures are changing, making
OSGrid full of 3rd party pieces is going to hamper the results.

Anyone can start up an opensim grid.  Anyone interested in doing
divergent development, or creative new experiments with grid bits,
should do that.  Start your own grid.  Get feedback on the code.  Bring
those bits back to the mailing list and mantis for a look.

I think our process for getting code in is pretty well understood (even
if we are slow from time to time).  Part of what has made this project
successful is following that process: 1) submit patches via mantis, 2)
prod developers if they don't get to it in a timely manner.  Developers
will comment on the appropriateness of the code (in mantis), and if it
is appropriate, it goes in.  If not, we try to provide feedback on how
it should change to go in.

OSGrid is Charles', for sure.  So what ever he decides is best there
goes.  I definitely continue to support his strong will in keeping
OSGrid a close to opensim upstream as possible.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
