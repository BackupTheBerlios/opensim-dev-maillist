<PRE>I think we have to consider here that the secondlife LL viewer is the mainstream client. Currently this is 1.19.1.4 and keeping compatibility with the current LL Viewer is very important. 

I hope to begin testing the OpenViewer soon on OpenSim sims. There are a few folks that have mentioned the RexClient. But, the SecondLife official client is the mainstream. All other clients, including OpenViewer and RexClient are secondary in interest at this point.

So, I would urge you to consider making compatibility of the RexClient to the LL Viewer to be a priority and urge you to keep compatibility with OpenSim as you move forward.

Hi,

The LL viewer is supposed to login only once and stay connected to that place for the whole session. If someone is willing to do &quot;a voodoo server side component&quot; that can act as a proxy between the client and different servers, then it might work. It just seems an awfully lot of trouble to just be able to use current LL Viewer. 

Maybe OpenViewer guys could also be interested to support the avatar architecture?

I like your viewer a lot,  but do you think there is a way
of restructuring this so that it can be used with the regular LL viewer? Why
does this need your viewer at all? Is it because the login process requires
additional cooperation from the client? I mean, I understand that the more fancy
avatar appearance that you have requires changes in the viewer, but I don't
see why the inter-grid TPs require a different viewer. Isn't there a way
of separating the inter-grid TPs from the avatar appearance? Could you explain
that?

Hi,
1)     
Will VeriSign or Yahoo &#8211; or whomever &#8211; be able to set up these
kinds of account services?



Yes that is right. 

 
2)     Does it work more or less the way I described my usage scenario? That is, willI be able to go from OSGrid to the public IBM grid under <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">crista at verisignvw.com</A>,assuming both grids accept verisignvw accounts?



yes just like that. You get also possibility to change your account in theteleporting process in case you know that another grid is not accepting yourexample <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">crista at verisignvw.comaccount</A> (actually this happens if you teleport to Second Life). 

 
3)     
Does this require the use of the realXtend viewer or can this be used with the
standard LL viewer?


Currently only realXtend viewer can be used, but I wish that
in the future there will be more support for this architecture. We maintain the
realXtend viewer so that it can be used to access also SL servers or standard
OpenSim. The avatar appearance from avatar storage can only be seen by others
on realXtend servers. The architecture needs support from both server and
client.

Hi,

Some comments how realXend has implemented things:
2008/4/10, Michael Wright &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">michaelwri22 at yahoo.co.uk</A>&gt;:
I haven't been able to find too much on how the RealXtend avatar system is
really going to work. And while in some ways I think its a step in the right
direction,  it also seems to limit a lot of things. I'm not so sure you
should alway have the same avatar for everything. Or should completely cut the
&quot;region servers&quot; out of the whole process. If I teleport to a region
that has a role playing game, maybe my avatar should automatically change (at
least clothes, but maybe body as well) to fit into that game. So the region has
to be able to have some say over the avatar. 

The current realXtend login process gives a control point for region servers aswell. When a user logs in to a region, the viewer sends URL to user's avatarstorage. The region then sends that URL t other viewers so that other user'scan see each other's avatars. It is possible that in e.g. a strict role playingworld, the region uses it's own avatar storage which stores a special avatarfor just that user. Then the region server sends URL to that avatar storageinstead of the one that viewer sent to the region. If we want to get reallysmart here, it would be also possible to combine something from the user'sregular avatar to the role playing game avatar to achieve nice results... e.g.using face form from user's regular avatar but otherwise using region specificbody and clothes. 

 
I have the same sort of thoughts about inventory. While it should not be
centralised, the regions do need to be able to (with permission) do certain
things, like maybe a region gives you a extra set of folders for use in that
region, but they disappear when you leave it. I am also not sure there should
be just one inventory set for each user. Why not a number of sub sets that can
be combined etc. Maybe the region could restrict access to only a certain set,
which might be a set that it provides, when in that region; no space ships when
in that serious business region.. Inventory really needs to swap to a more url
based system. 

We are just thinking how to build all this in realXtend. Currently we havethought that each user will have a region specific inventory and a personalinventory. The personal inventory is stored at avatar storage so it will travelwith the avatar. 

Also we need to remember not everything will be interconnected. There willbe some applications (or possible grids) that want to be separate fromeverything else. 

So I don't think we should be forcing any centralised system on people. And yesfrom what I've read, I actually think the realxtend avatar system sounds toocentralised, but that could be because I don't know enough details of what isplanned. I'm not saying its wrong, it just doesn't fit all possible uses. So weneed things to at least be modular. 

Currently realXtend components have been designed so that there are nocentralized control points, it would be really a bad planning to build such anarchitecture on that kind of centralized assumptions. In realXtendarchitecture, everyone can set up their own avatar storages and userauthentication services and decide to trust or not to other user'sauthentication services. 
If a virtual world hosting company wants to make a completely walled gardensolution with realXtend, that is also possible. They can set up their ownavatar authentication and storage and trust no-one else's authentication server(there is a basic allow/deny setting for this). 

 
Having said all that, of course I think a lot of people and applications
will want to have shared resources like these. Just we have to be careful in
how they are implemented. And for opensim at least, that should be a open
process/design that everyone can be part of. 

A team of people almost always reaches better solutions over individual. Allthe different use cases should be covered in a great care. I hope thatrealXtend initiative with the distributed avatar architecture is being refinedwith the OpenSim community involvement. I am sure that there are still manythings that need addressing. The realXtend code is available at <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/realxtendserver/and">http://sourceforge.net/projects/realxtendserver/and</A> as I mentioned in my earlier mail, we will have a new version, which isbased on current OpenSim, soon available.

Best regards,
Jani Pirkola
realXtend program manager

Short answers. I don't know, and no. The process for code coming into
OpenSim is to put a patch in mantis. I haven't seen any proposed
patches in this area in mantis.

</I>
Hence you've created the paradox. :)

* We want everything connected
* We don't want to trust a single authoritative source for info
(otherwise you'd be on Second Life)

Honestly, this is a hard problem to solve, and one that seems a bit
beyond the current scope. That being said, implementations and research
in this area which work with OpenSim are always welcomed.

&gt;<i> I understand there's a ton of stability work to be done, but this 
</I>&gt;<i> particular architectural decision is really important, even 
</I>&gt;<i> (especially?) at this early stage; we all trust stability will happen

</I>&gt;<i> Is there anything that I can do to boost the efforts in that direction, 
</I>&gt;<i> besides sending this email?
</I>
Sample peer based User services that allow cross talk would be useful.
The moral equivalent of OpenID for virtual worlds (because you need more
than just what openid provides).
