<PRE>What's the current status on the thread issues? Are we looking into it? Have we identified consumers/culprits?
 
Best,

( is it large &gt; enough ? )&gt; &gt; In the past ( before SVN.3335 or something ) when running OpenSim, &gt; just after the simulator goes Up, the OpenSim.exe process use around &gt; 96 threads and everything works fine,&gt; But, now, I saw that this number of threads reach 118 :(&gt; As I posted in the past in Mantis that Mono under Linux is really bad &gt; ( performances &amp; coredump ) when you reach the limit of 170 threads ...&gt; &gt; When I connect 1 user to the sim : Thread count is now reaching : 157&gt; When I connect a 2nd user to the sim : Thread count reach : 200&gt; ( in that case : 200 threads used, the sim doesn't crash like in the &gt; past but I find everything slow ... and my CPU is now 100% use / 7% &gt; Ram used )&gt; &gt; Then, that mean, each time a user is connecting to the Sim, it use &gt; about 40 threads ...&gt; So, if I like to connect 20 users, I need around 40x20 threads = 800 &gt; threads ...&gt; And I'm not sure at all that Mono could manage that :(&gt; &gt; What's you're feeling on that point ?&gt; &gt; So, my question is : why not forking a new &quot;OpenSim.exe&quot; process for &gt; each new connected user ?&gt; Of course it's mostly for the standalone mode ( but the problem is a &gt; bit the same in Grid Mode ) ...&gt; &gt; Maybe it's a simple/stupid idea from me, because I haven't enough &gt; development skills to help all the people working hard to bring up &gt; this marvelous simulator.&gt; &gt; Please, just let me know your position about it.&gt; &gt; Thanks a lot guys for all your dev,&gt; &gt; Regards,&gt; &gt; Ursula Matova&gt; ( Of course this is my S/L Avatar Name :) )&gt; &gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-dev mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Opensim-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A>
