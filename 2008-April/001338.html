<PRE>I have 14 regions using a central MySQL server for all storage that I'm
comfortable giving access to the core devs.

I plan on upgrading it to latest trunk this weekend. I can open up ports
on the firewall to get them SSH access if it's wanted as a testing
ground for tracking this issue.

</I>&gt;<i> Yesterday the UCIGrid folks tried to update past r4058 and had a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> During all of this, OSGrid is working pretty well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can tell you that some regions on OSGrid are running SQLite (plazas,
</I>&gt;<i> Yang, Celt, 'moons' to name a few) and others are running MySQL
</I>&gt;<i> (Nebadon's, daTwitch's) and we did that intentionally to test both
</I>&gt;<i> datastores.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But, heres the deal. There is no centralized datastor for *any* region
</I>&gt;<i> on OSGrid. The UGAI MySQL database stands on its own and contains the
</I>&gt;<i> users, regions, assets, inventory and web site folders.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No region talks to the UGAI MySQL except through the UGAI. Each region
</I>&gt;<i> has its own standalone MySQL or SQLite datastor. Another point. I did
</I>&gt;<i> run the plazas on the UGAI server for a while, but I had some trouble
</I>&gt;<i> with the gridserver freezing and a couple of months ago, I moved the
</I>&gt;<i> plazas to our backup server and they have been running much better
</I>&gt;<i> ever since.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It very well may be that we have uncovered a problem. If so, this is
</I>&gt;<i> going to be tough to close the loop as we dont have that use case
</I>&gt;<i> setup anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are 4 of the core team that have console access to OSGrid and
</I>&gt;<i> generally just watch over our shoulder or read entries in the MySQL
</I>&gt;<i> datastore. We did that in order to have a way for our core developers
</I>&gt;<i> insight into the dynamics of a running grid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But, since OSGrid is a heterogeneous grid, meaning, all the regions
</I>&gt;<i> are *elsewhere*. That is, none are on the same lan segment as the
</I>&gt;<i> UGAI, all the regions datastores are local to the regions and not
</I>&gt;<i> connected to the UGAI except through the external UGAI interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmmm. If true, how are we going to figure this one out for grids that
</I>&gt;<i> are more homogeneous, that is, the regions are tied more closely to
</I>&gt;<i> the UGAI then on OSGrid.
