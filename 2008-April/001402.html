Short answers.  I don't know, and no.  The process for code coming into
OpenSim is to put a patch in mantis.  I haven't seen any proposed
patches in this area in mantis.

Hence you've created the paradox. :)

 * We want everything connected
 * We don't want to trust a single authoritative source for info
   (otherwise you'd be on Second Life)

Honestly, this is a hard problem to solve, and one that seems a bit
beyond the current scope.  That being said, implementations and research
in this area which work with OpenSim are always welcomed.

&gt;<i> I understand there's a ton of stability work to be done, but this 
</I>&gt;<i> particular architectural decision is really important, even 
</I>&gt;<i> (especially?) at this early stage; we all trust stability will happen 
</I>&gt;<i> over time.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there anything that I can do to boost the efforts in that direction, 
</I>&gt;<i> besides sending this email?
</I>
Sample peer based User services that allow cross talk would be useful.
The moral equivalent of OpenID for virtual worlds (because you need more
than just what openid provides).

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
