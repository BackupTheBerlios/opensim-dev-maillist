<PRE>Yes the aim of opensim is to have a set of protocols and API, that is stable. But we are no where near that point yet. The grid procotols need to change, they have been on our roadmap to change for months now. And by having two versions of the UGAI in two different languages in svn, makes doing changes a lot harder. We can't say that current API's/protocols are stable as they are now, a lot still needs to change. So we need to make sure there aren't extra things stopping those changes.

I for one am delighted to see implementations in alternate languages coming to the fore; c# has been shown to be anything but optimal for this application area (IMHO) and alternatives are beneficial in a variety of ways, from providing practical alternatives to performance baselines.
 
I am so committed to this notion that I have undertaken the study of Erlang in the interest of creating an implementation of opensim in that language, which in my estimation is a far more suitable implementation language than either perl or c#.
 
This of course represents only my personal perspective, and perhaps only incidentally that of a few others; and while what is a solution for me or lulurun is not necesarily the solution for everyone, every effort should be made to encourage such efforts in the interest of providing options to the implementor of regions and grids.
 
At the very least, every effort should be made not to discourage such projects.

For me, I say leave the perl code right where it is, and embrace this turn of events with the same sort of technical vigor and optimism that has been typical of this project in the past.
 
Just my 0.02$L

 Hi,
 
 to me, the apache-based UGAI seems like a light at the end of the
 tunnel, finally there is a way to create a UGAI that is not all
 custom stuff, where one bad request can't kill the grid dead, where
 restarting is easy, and load balancing is, as well.
 
 Taking it out of SVN means relegating it to a backseat, where
 changes in it can be made by only it's creator. Developer feedback
 would be low to nonexistent. It would totally preclude it becoming
 the &quot;standard&quot; UGAI, replacing the C# ones.
 
 I say, leave it in there and let people vote with their feet! I
 never felt comfortable with the C# UGAI, and I'm happy this has
 finally appeared.
 
 Some here have written alternative UGAI, but never much publicized
 that. Now someone does, and it sparks up a whole big controversy.
 Some people don't trust the C# UGAI, so why is there a desire to
 make it appear that those are the only option?

 &gt; One problem with having two sets of UGAI is that it makes changes harder to do. As I'm not really a perl programmer, if I was going to doing a change to something in the grid servers or the protocol. It would mean I either had to change the perl ones too or break those. And as they are in our svn, we would most likely getting people complaining they are broke. And this is a big factor in my mind as over the next few weeks there is a chance that I will be able to do some work on the grid servers/protocols.
  &gt;
 &gt;  I'm with Stefan on this one, in that I'm all for there being different implementations of the UGAI's but think for now we should only have one in the svn other wise it is just going to lead to confusion/problems if one implementation is broke because of some change to the other. So think other implementations should be outside the svn.
  &gt;
 &gt; We do understand that not everyone wants to use the standard c# versions (and to be fair, who would? with the general state they are in). Thats why we (myself and Stefan) have wrote our own ASP version of some of the backend servers, but we haven't added them to the svn for the reasons I gave above. In that not everyone would want to run ASP servers, so we think at this time at least there should only be one version in svn. So that people aren't affraid to do changes in them, like they could be if they knew that there was other versions in svn that they were breaking by doing those changes.

 &gt;  Also, the whole 'share' dir should be externalized into some other repository, or just a (set of) downloadable tarball(s) on the wiki, ASAP

 &gt; Subject: [Opensim-dev] Perl vs C# UGAI?
 &gt;
 
&gt;<i>    .ExternalClass DIV {;}     I am really puzzled about this new Perl UGAI and it leads to a number of questions:
</I> &gt;
 &gt; Are we going to have two sets of servers for grid mode? One written in C# and the other written in Perl?
 &gt;
 &gt; Will we have each of them with the same features? Will we abandon the C# UGAI servers?
 &gt;
 &gt; How will we seperate out issues between regions on a grid and the grid servers if some grids run with Perl UGAI and some run with C# UGAI?
