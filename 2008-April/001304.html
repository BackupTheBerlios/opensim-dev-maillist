<PRE>Yup, I'm all for alternative UGAI's, although I certainly don't want to see a perl version becoming the standard one. But at this time we really only want one version in svn, otherwise no one will work on grid protocols due to breaking things.

 Most of us aren't really perl programmers and as has been said before by one of the developers &quot;I signed up for c#&quot;. We need svn to be what most of the developers feel happy working on. I'm also very likely to break Grid protocols/servers over the next few weeks compared to how they are now, and have no plans on changing the perl version. So while I support it and think its a good thing that there is such a version, it really should be in a separate svn.

I like the idea of alternative UGAI, but given that Grid Comms are far
from stabalized, we'll probably have much more responsive
implementations if they aren't in tree.  Honestly, I suspect I'll break
Grid Comms a couple of times this month (I know at least one place that
I've got to break it in the next couple of days), and that's just me.

I think having UGAI services elsewhere actually will let people be more
responsive to those changes.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
