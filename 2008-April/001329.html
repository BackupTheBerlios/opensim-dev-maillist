<PRE>I guess in some ways it could be thought as a network bus, but I wasn't thinking of the messages being broadcast on the channel, where all endpoints had to listen to all messages and pick out the ones for them. I was thinking, if anything, of more like a cut down web services protocol stack.

My prototype channel is just a basic HTTP based one. That just finds where the url of the channel receiver, that the required servlet is currently registered at, is. Then does a HTTP POST of the serialised message to that url. 

But the implementation should be up to the channels. All the rest of the system should care is that a channel can pass messages from one end point to another, and can map some standard addressing scheme to those endpoints. Allowing for a dynamic system, where the addressable message receivers (the servlets) can move around the endpoints on a channel as needed. And new endpoints can be added.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of my aims is to try to separate the network code more from the 
</I>&gt;<i> logic code. So am thinking of what I'm calling a Channel and servlet 
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A servlet is just a class that performs some service. I'm thinking 
</I>&gt;<i> more in terms of breaking up the current servers into smaller 
</I>&gt;<i> services/servlets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So then we have a collection of servlets that do the various functions 
</I>&gt;<i> that the current servers do (except I'm not including the asset server 
</I>&gt;<i> in this as think that is best kept to a proper REST resource based 
</I>&gt;<i> system).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then we come to the channel, maybe this is a bad term for what I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> thinking, but anyway. The channel has two (or three) parts, the 
</I>&gt;<i> sender/receivers, which are responsible for the 
</I>&gt;<i> serialising/deserialising of the messages/datagrams, and also of 
</I>&gt;<i> sending it to the correct url. To find the url that a message should 
</I>&gt;<i> be sent to, the other part of the channel is responsible. I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> currently thinking of this as a basic central hash table service, that 
</I>&gt;<i> just keeps track of the servlets that are registered on that channel 
</I>&gt;<i> and the url of the endpoint that they are one. Of course the idea with 
</I>&gt;<i> the channel is to keep the code separate from the service logic, so 
</I>&gt;<i> how the servlet tracking is done is up to the implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  While each servlet could actually have its own endpoint/channel 
</I>&gt;<i> receiver, I'm thinking more of a collection of them sharing a 
</I>&gt;<i> endpoint. So normally maybe only one endpoint per server instance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So all a channel really is: Is a managed collection of known services 
</I>&gt;<i> and the url they can be reached at. Plus the code for de/serialising 
</I>&gt;<i> the messages in the format that channel uses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The third component is the Router service. Each server instance would 
</I>&gt;<i> have one of these, that is tasked with routing the messages to and 
</I>&gt;<i> from the channel endpoint to the correct servlet.  A router could be 
</I>&gt;<i> connected to more than one channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again a basic concept. The task is just to keep track of servlets in 
</I>&gt;<i> that instance, to know what channels they should be receiving messages 
</I>&gt;<i> from. To be able to route a message from a servlet to a channel; 
</I>&gt;<i> either a particular channel, or the servlet might just say any channel 
</I>&gt;<i> that has a particular type of service registered on it. Also the 
</I>&gt;<i> router should be able to do internal routing...from one servlet to 
</I>&gt;<i> another that is in the same instance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also thinking that the region servers will have such a router and 
</I>&gt;<i> be registered on a channel(s). And then region modules could send and 
</I>&gt;<i> receive messages the same way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My thoughts and actually my requirements for some other ideas. Is to 
</I>&gt;<i> have a dynamic modular system. That keeps the network code completely 
</I>&gt;<i> separate from the services logic. I really think that the current 
</I>&gt;<i> servers are too err monolithic and really group together a bunch of 
</I>&gt;<i> services that are separate. I don't mean they should always be on 
</I>&gt;<i> separate servers, just the code should be separated more and more 
</I>&gt;<i> modular.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So my thoughts are lots of smaller services/servlets. And once we do 
</I>&gt;<i> that, it could lead to lots of url having to be kept track of by each 
</I>&gt;<i> other servlet if we used the current approach. So thats why I think 
</I>&gt;<i> the network code , including url management/tracking should be 
</I>&gt;<i> completely separate.
</I>&gt;<i> This also I think/hope could help with scaling things. In that as the 
</I>&gt;<i> servlets can be grouped together as needed (and even moved around the 
</I>&gt;<i> server instances). Then a very small grid might only want to run one 
</I>&gt;<i> backend server instance that had all the servlets that it needs 
</I>&gt;<i> running. While a much larger grid might have a server instance for 
</I>&gt;<i> each servlet, and maybe more than one servlet of each type running.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Also its possible that we could use the same servlets in standalone 
</I>&gt;<i> mode, as they would just use the internal routing function of the 
</I>&gt;<i> routing service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another benefit is it helps to make the whole thing more customizable. 
</I>&gt;<i> In a number of different ways. One of those ways is something that 
</I>&gt;<i> I've done some prototyping of. Which is as the servlets and router 
</I>&gt;<i> classes have no network code in at all. Its a simple task to write 
</I>&gt;<i> different versions of the channel receivers/senders for say a ASP.net 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are still a number of things that need more thought. But thats a 
</I>&gt;<i> general overview of my ideas
