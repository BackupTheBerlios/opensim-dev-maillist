<PRE>Also we need to remember that opensim is not just about creating 3d virtual worlds in the SL mould. We want to support all types of 3d multi user applications and some of them will not require/want any avatars. Like some 3d visualization applications. So whatever system we go with needs to support, I would say region level control of, not having a avatar being shown to the user.

And while in some ways I think its a step in the right direction,  it also seems to limit a lot of things. I'm not so sure you should alway have the same avatar for everything. Or should completely cut the &quot;region servers&quot; out of the whole process. If I teleport to a region that has a role playing game, maybe my avatar should automatically change (at least clothes, but maybe body as well) to fit into that game. So the region has to be able to have some say over the avatar. 

I have the same sort of thoughts about inventory. While it should not be centralised, the regions do need to be able to (with permission) do certain things, like maybe a region gives you a extra set of folders for use in that region, but they disappear when you leave it. I am also not sure there should be just one inventory set for each user. Why not a number of sub sets that can be combined etc.  Maybe the region could restrict access to only a certain set, which might be a set that it provides, when in that region; no space ships when in that serious business region.. Inventory really needs to swap to a more url based system. 

Also we need to remember not everything will be interconnected. There will be some applications (or possible grids) that want to be separate from everything else. 

So I don't think we should be forcing any centralised system on people. And yes from what I've read, I actually think the realxtend avatar system sounds too centralised, but that could be because I don't know enough details of what is planned. I'm not saying its wrong, it just doesn't fit all possible uses. So we need things to at least be modular. 

Having said all that, of course I think a lot of people and applications will want to have shared resources like these. Just we have to be careful in how they are implemented. And for opensim at least, that should  be a open process/design that everyone can be part of.

Short answers.  I don't know, and no.  The process for code coming into
OpenSim is to put a patch in mantis.  I haven't seen any proposed
patches in this area in mantis.

Hence you've created the paradox. :)

 * We want everything connected
 * We don't want to trust a single authoritative source for info
   (otherwise you'd be on Second Life)

Honestly, this is a hard problem to solve, and one that seems a bit
beyond the current scope.  That being said, implementations and research
in this area which work with OpenSim are always welcomed.

&gt;<i> I understand there's a ton of stability work to be done, but this

</I>&gt;<i> (especially?) at this early stage; we all trust stability will happen

</I>&gt;<i> Is there anything that I can do to boost the efforts in that direction, 
</I>&gt;<i> besides sending this  email?
</I>
Sample peer based User services that allow cross talk would be useful.
The moral equivalent of OpenID for virtual worlds (because you need more
than just what openid provides).

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
