<PRE>I'm not sure that I'm following you in regard to appearance currently being a function of land? not sure how it is. The region module is a shared module so its a instance module so not tied to land. I think we should be using modules for a lot more things. Including a lot of the things currently in the commsmanager.

But yes for grid mode the module should fetch and update a backend service. One way is to call functions in user service or one of the other commsmanager services. But I really think we should be trying to kill the commsmanager concept. And instead have a method for the modules to send and receive data packets directly to the backend servers. This is what I have talked about in my ogs 1.5 mails. 

But I guess I'm missing something as I don't really see how the avatar appearance is that different to the avatarprofile module. Except in the current version there is no backend service communications. But remember this is the standalone version of the module. The grid version would have such communications happening (which ever way it was done). The module would just do similar caching (we certainly want some local caching if only for use when running multiple regions per instance)  to the current standalone version, but instead of directly connecting to a db would communicate with a backend server/service. 

So basically the idea of the grid mode avatar appearance module is for it to be very similar to the profile module. Just with everything being in the air with the grid protocols. I'm waiting a while before I planned to do the grid version.

To clarify, what I really want to do is make Apperance like Profile, and
the AvatarAppearance Region Module work more like AvatarProfilesModule
in getting the user server to save the information back for it.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
