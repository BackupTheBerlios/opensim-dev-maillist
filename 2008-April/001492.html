<PRE>Thank you kindly Kyle. We have tried to have a long-running testing environment since last summer and have a combination of testing and community building going on continuously.

This multiple root inventory issue is something that has plagued us for a while. One of my current thrusts is to find a way to clean our database without re-initializing it. 

Many folks like unit tests. Personally, I find that one can move faster with system tests of a running system as one is able to sort out the &quot;wheat from the chaff&quot;. There are some times this is possible, some times it is not. 

In any case, thanks for the vote of confidence. It makes me feel that this effort of updating OSGrid every single day and working with hundreds of region owners, thousands of users and nearly 100,000 assets is useful to the project.

Charles

I wholeheartedly agree.  The two goals (cleanliness and insight) are
not mutually incompatible.

Alpha-time is the time when the greatest insight is needed into how
the designs behave.  If a given design causes problems that violate
the constraints of the environment, some aspect of the design needs to
be changed BEFORE the code goes to beta (or worse, release).

If you like, you can think of it as a means of obtaining test
information from long-running tests, as opposed to unit-testing single
discrete units of functionality.  (Not that OpenSim has much of that,
either.)  If you can create a clean design for integrating run-time
gathering of statistics, then you've solved one of the main problems
that eventually integrates alpha-quality code and design into beta or
release software.

I'm specifically thinking OSgrid with my suggestion -- but there's no
reason it couldn't be made into a developmental tool to figure out
when and how things break when the code is changed.  It also allows
for useful identification of when problems were introduced.  (In fact,
since OSgrid is OpenSim's largest-scale and longest-running tester,
such insight being made available can only help speed development.)
