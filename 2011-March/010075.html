<PRE>the only thing we've touched so far is the entity update queue. that's all
avatar updates &amp; prim updates. we haven't touched any of the other packets.
the resend focus would be for prims &amp; avatar updates only.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Over the last several weeks, Dan Lake &amp; I have been looking some of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; networking performance issues in opensim. As always, our concerns are
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the problems caused by very complex scenes with very large numbers of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; avatars. However, I think some of the issues we have found will generally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; improve networking with OpenSim. Since the behavior represents a fairly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; significant change in behavior (though the number of lines of code is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; great), I'm going to put this into a separate branch for testing (called
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; queuetest) in the opensim git repository.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We've found several problems with the current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; networking/prioritization code.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Reprioritization is completely broken for SceneObjectParts. On
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reprioritization, the current code uses the localid stored in the scene
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Entities list but since the scene does not store the localid for SOPs,
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attempt always fails. So the original priority of the SOP continues to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used. This could be the cause of some problems since the initial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prioritization assumes position 128,128. I don't understand all the
</I>&gt;<i> possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ramifications, but suffice it to say, using the localid is causing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problems.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fix: The sceneentity is already stored in the update, just use that
</I>&gt;<i> instead
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the localid.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * We currently pull (by default) 100 entity updates from the entityupdate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; queue and convert them into packets. Once converted into packets, they
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then queued again for transmissions. This is a bad thing. Under any kind
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; load, we've measured the time in the packet queue to be up to many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hundreds/thousands of milliseconds (and to be highly variable). When an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; object changes one property and then doesn't change it again, the time in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the packet queue is largely irrelevant. However, if the object is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; continuously changing (an avatar changing position, a physical object
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moving, etc) then the conversion from a entity update to a packet
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;freezes&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the properties to be sent. If the object is continuously changing, then
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fairly high probability, the packet contains old data (the properties of
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; entity from the point at which it was converted into a packet).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The real problem is that, in theory, to improve the efficiency of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packets (fill up each message) we are grabbing big chunks of updates.
</I>&gt;<i> Under
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; load, that causes queuing at the packet layer which makes updates stale.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is... queuing at the packet layer is BAD.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fix: We implemented an adaptive algorithm for the number of updates to
</I>&gt;<i> grab
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with each pass. We set a target time of 200ms for each iteration. That
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means, we are trying to bound the maximum age of any update in the packet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; queue to 200ms. The adaptive algorithm looks a lot like a TCP slow start:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; every time we complete an iteration (flush the packet queue) in less than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 200ms we increase linearly the number of updates we take in the next
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; iteration (add 5 to the count) and when we don't make it back in 200ms,
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; drop the number we take quadratically (cut the number in half). In our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experiments with large numbers of moving avatars, this algorithm works
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *very* well. The number of updates taken per iteration stabilizes very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quickly and the response time is dramatically improved (no &quot;snap back&quot; on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; avatars, for example). One difference from the traditional slow start...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since the number of &quot;static&quot; items in the queue is very high when a
</I>&gt;<i> client
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first enters a region, we start with the number of updates taken at 500.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that gets the static items out of the queue quickly (and delay doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; matter as much) and the number taken is generally stable before the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; login/teleport screen even goes away.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * The current prioritization queue can lead to update starvation. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prioritization algorithm dumps all entity updates into a single ordered
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; queue. Lets say you have several hundred avatars moving around in a
</I>&gt;<i> scene.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since we take a limited number of updates from the queue in each
</I>&gt;<i> iteration,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we will take only the updates for the &quot;closest&quot; (highest priority)
</I>&gt;<i> avatars.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, since those avatars continue to move, they are re-inserted into
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; priority queue *ahead* of the updates that were already there. So...
</I>&gt;<i> unless
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the queue can be completely emptied each iteration or the priority of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;distant&quot; (low priority) avatars changes, those avatars will never be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; updated.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fix: We converted the single priority queue into multiple priority queues
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and use fair queuing to retrieve updates from each. Here's how it works
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (more or less)... the current metrics (all of the current prioritization
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; algorithms use distance at some point for prioritization) compute a
</I>&gt;<i> distance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the avatar/camera to an object. We take the log of that distance and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use that as the index for the queue where we place the update. So close
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things go into the highest priority queue and distant things go into the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lowest priority queue. Since the area covered by a priority queue grows
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the square of the radius, the distant (lowest priority queues) will have
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most objects while the highest priority queues will have a small number
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; objects. Inside each priority queue, we order the updates by the time in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which they entered the queue. Then we pull a fixed number of updates from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; each priority queue each iteration. The result is that local updates get
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; high fraction of the outgoing bandwidth but distant updates are
</I>&gt;<i> guaranteed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to get at least &quot;some&quot; of the bandwidth. No starvation. The current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prioritization algorithm we implemented is a modification of the &quot;best
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; avatar responsiveness&quot; and &quot;front back&quot; in that we use root prim location
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for child prims and the priority of updates &quot;in back&quot; of the avatar is
</I>&gt;<i> lower
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than updates &quot;in front&quot;. Our experiments show that the fair queuing does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; drain the update queue AND continues to provide a disproportionately high
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; percentage of the bw to &quot;close&quot; updates.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One other note on this... we should be able to improve the performance of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reprioritization with this approach. If we know the distance an avatar
</I>&gt;<i> has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moved, we only have to reprioritize objects that might have changed
</I>&gt;<i> priority
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; queues. Haven't implemented this yet but have some ideas for how to do
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * The resend queue is evil. When an update packet is sent (they are
</I>&gt;<i> marked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reliable) it is moved to a queue to await acknowledgement. If no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; acknowledgement is received (in time), the packet is retransmitted and
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wait time is doubled and so on... What that means is that a resend
</I>&gt;<i> packets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in a scene that is rapidly changing will often contain updates that are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; outdated. That is, when we resend the packet, we are just resending old
</I>&gt;<i> data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (and if you're having a lot of resends that means you already have a bad
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection &amp; now you're filling it up with useless data).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fix: this isn't implemented yet (help would be appreciated)... we think
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead of saving packets for resend... a better solution would be to
</I>&gt;<i> keep
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the entity updates that went into the packet. if we don't receive an ack
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time, then put the entity updates back into the entity update queue (with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; entry time from their original enqueuing). That would ensure that we send
</I>&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; update for the object &amp; that the data sent is the most recent.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * One final note... per client bandwidth throttles seem to work very
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; however, our experiments with per-simulator throttles was not positive.
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appeared that a small number of clients was consuming all of the bw
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available to the simulator and the rest were starved. Haven't looked into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this any more.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Feedback appreciated... there is some logging code (disabled) in the
</I>&gt;<i> branch;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; real data would be great. And help testing. there are a number of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attachment, deletes and so on that i'm not sure work correctly.
