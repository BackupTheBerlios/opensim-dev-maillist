There are a few notes and possible issues at 
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7.1_Planning">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7.1_Planning</A>

I think things seem to be getting into a pretty stable state 
Justin... and certainly good enough to start an RC.

One other &quot;blocker&quot; I have noted is the problem that any user or HG 
visitor who comes into a grid/system that includes Freeswitch gets a 
stream of server side messages that slow the sim to a crawl.  Viewer 
2 cannot work with Freeswitch currently anyway.. but this is a 
problem the user cannot see (other than things going ultra slow for 
them and others until they log off) and it makes things difficult to 
manage.  The only way to fix it is to tell all users/visitors to turn 
off voice in their viewer 2s... which of course is not their 
default.  <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=5336">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=5336</A>

If we cannot fix this properly, I wonder if some way to have the 
module NOT try to use freeswitch if it detects viewer 2 is in use can 
be put in to stop this problem?
