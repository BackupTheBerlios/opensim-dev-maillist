Cool.  That particular bug is quickly coming up on my list of things to look at.  You may want to Mantis the other one 
as well if you can reproduce it to a simple sequence of repeatable steps.

Blockers is going to be a somewhat elastic definition.  At this alpa level of code maturity, I would say that it 
generally means things that make OpenSim completely unusable (more so than previously!) or are significant regressions 
from previous functionality.  Core developers have the final say on classification.  However, I hope that we can address 
a reasonable number of bugs as well.
