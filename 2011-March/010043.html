Yes, I think it was confusing.  Hopefully it's a bit clearer what is going on now.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Will there be confusion with the new prompts if we have 18 &quot;My Estate&quot; named estates? (and maybe in some grids thousands)?
</I>
With the new prompts, if you set up a new region and want to join it to an existing estate, then you'll appear to be 
offered 18 name choices all with &quot;My Estate&quot;.  If you pick &quot;My Estate&quot; then it will join it to the first one.

If you set up a new region and want to put it in its own estate, you'll no longer be able to create a new region with 
the &quot;My Estate&quot; name, you'll need to select another name.

Estates are maintained region side, so the only name options you see will be those that you have set up locally.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would you anyway recommend that I manually rename the estates and remap the regions to the ones intended? Or is it all
</I>&gt;<i> best left alone?
</I>
If you've not noticed an issue so far then I recommend leaving it alone.  Remapping should just be case of changing the 
entries in the estate_map table.  Eventually I would hope to see a console command for doing this.
