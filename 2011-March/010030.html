<PRE>I am looking again at Map Tiles in Viewer 2 with 0.7.1 dev master.... 
I am convinced I saw our Openvue region map tiles at some stage... 
and even made snapshots of them in a Mantis entry when I thought that 
the issue was that only certain zoom levels showed up:

      <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=5355">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=5355</A>

But I am not now sure under what conditions I saw those images, and 
the LL served regions that may be at the same xloc/yloc cell on the 
LL map for SL seem to show instead. Can anyone shed light on what is 
MEANT to happen?

BUT.. I was thinking....  I know that Mic Bowman generalised the 
[SimianGridMaptiles] module so that it can post the map tiles in the 
form required to any location... and I am using Diva's Wifi for our 
web services and I know that Marck recently added a facility in Wifi 
to serve arbitrary web content from nominated directories.  Could 
this be all that is needed and that with suitable module enable and 
Wifi configuration in OpenSim.ini and Robust[.HG].ini I can already 
get this to work I wonder?

------
The OpenSim.ini can contain the following.. but maybe this has 
altered with Mic's generalised module?  He did say that you can post 
images to any file location/directory too now I think but I have not 
spotted which parameters need setting for that?

;; If you are using a simian grid frontend you can enable
;; this module to upload tile images for the mapping fn
;;
[SimianGridMaptiles]
     Enabled = False
     MaptileURL = &quot;<A HREF="http://www.mygrid.com/Grid/">http://www.mygrid.com/Grid/</A>&quot;
     RefreshTime = 3600


And theRobust[.HG].ini can contain a URL to give to the Viewer 2 for 
map tiles it seems...

[LoginService]
     ...
     ; For Viewer 2 and other viewers using HTTP served maps
     ; MapTileURL = &quot;&quot;;
