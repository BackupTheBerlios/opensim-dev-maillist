<PRE>Over the last several weeks, Dan Lake &amp; I have been looking some of the
networking performance issues in opensim. As always, our concerns are with
the problems caused by very complex scenes with very large numbers of
avatars. However, I think some of the issues we have found will generally
improve networking with OpenSim. Since the behavior represents a fairly
significant change in behavior (though the number of lines of code is not
great), I'm going to put this into a separate branch for testing (called
queuetest) in the opensim git repository.

We've found several problems with the current
networking/prioritization code.

* Reprioritization is completely broken for SceneObjectParts. On
reprioritization, the current code uses the localid stored in the scene
Entities list but since the scene does not store the localid for SOPs, that
attempt always fails. So the original priority of the SOP continues to be
used. This could be the cause of some problems since the initial
prioritization assumes position 128,128. I don't understand all the possible
ramifications, but suffice it to say, using the localid is causing
problems.

Fix: The sceneentity is already stored in the update, just use that instead
of the localid.

* We currently pull (by default) 100 entity updates from the entityupdate
queue and convert them into packets. Once converted into packets, they are
then queued again for transmissions. This is a bad thing. Under any kind of
load, we've measured the time in the packet queue to be up to many
hundreds/thousands of milliseconds (and to be highly variable). When an
object changes one property and then doesn't change it again, the time in
the packet queue is largely irrelevant. However, if the object is
continuously changing (an avatar changing position, a physical object
moving, etc) then the conversion from a entity update to a packet &quot;freezes&quot;
the properties to be sent. If the object is continuously changing, then with
fairly high probability, the packet contains old data (the properties of the
entity from the point at which it was converted into a packet).

The real problem is that, in theory, to improve the efficiency of the
packets (fill up each message) we are grabbing big chunks of updates. Under
load, that causes queuing at the packet layer which makes updates stale.
That is... queuing at the packet layer is BAD.

Fix: We implemented an adaptive algorithm for the number of updates to grab
with each pass. We set a target time of 200ms for each iteration. That
means, we are trying to bound the maximum age of any update in the packet
queue to 200ms. The adaptive algorithm looks a lot like a TCP slow start:
every time we complete an iteration (flush the packet queue) in less than
200ms we increase linearly the number of updates we take in the next
iteration (add 5 to the count) and when we don't make it back in 200ms, we
drop the number we take quadratically (cut the number in half). In our
experiments with large numbers of moving avatars, this algorithm works
*very* well. The number of updates taken per iteration stabilizes very
quickly and the response time is dramatically improved (no &quot;snap back&quot; on
avatars, for example). One difference from the traditional slow start...
since the number of &quot;static&quot; items in the queue is very high when a client
first enters a region, we start with the number of updates taken at 500.
that gets the static items out of the queue quickly (and delay doesn't
matter as much) and the number taken is generally stable before the
login/teleport screen even goes away.

* The current prioritization queue can lead to update starvation. The
prioritization algorithm dumps all entity updates into a single ordered
queue. Lets say you have several hundred avatars moving around in a scene.
Since we take a limited number of updates from the queue in each iteration,
we will take only the updates for the &quot;closest&quot; (highest priority) avatars.
However, since those avatars continue to move, they are re-inserted into the
priority queue *ahead* of the updates that were already there. So... unless
the queue can be completely emptied each iteration or the priority of the
&quot;distant&quot; (low priority) avatars changes, those avatars will never be
updated.

Fix: We converted the single priority queue into multiple priority queues
and use fair queuing to retrieve updates from each. Here's how it works
(more or less)... the current metrics (all of the current prioritization
algorithms use distance at some point for prioritization) compute a distance
from the avatar/camera to an object. We take the log of that distance and
use that as the index for the queue where we place the update. So close
things go into the highest priority queue and distant things go into the
lowest priority queue. Since the area covered by a priority queue grows as
the square of the radius, the distant (lowest priority queues) will have the
most objects while the highest priority queues will have a small number of
objects. Inside each priority queue, we order the updates by the time in
which they entered the queue. Then we pull a fixed number of updates from
each priority queue each iteration. The result is that local updates get a
high fraction of the outgoing bandwidth but distant updates are guaranteed
to get at least &quot;some&quot; of the bandwidth. No starvation. The current
prioritization algorithm we implemented is a modification of the &quot;best
avatar responsiveness&quot; and &quot;front back&quot; in that we use root prim location
for child prims and the priority of updates &quot;in back&quot; of the avatar is lower
than updates &quot;in front&quot;. Our experiments show that the fair queuing does
drain the update queue AND continues to provide a disproportionately high
percentage of the bw to &quot;close&quot; updates.

One other note on this... we should be able to improve the performance of
reprioritization with this approach. If we know the distance an avatar has
moved, we only have to reprioritize objects that might have changed priority
queues. Haven't implemented this yet but have some ideas for how to do it.

* The resend queue is evil. When an update packet is sent (they are marked
reliable) it is moved to a queue to await acknowledgement. If no
acknowledgement is received (in time), the packet is retransmitted and the
wait time is doubled and so on... What that means is that a resend packets
in a scene that is rapidly changing will often contain updates that are
outdated. That is, when we resend the packet, we are just resending old data
(and if you're having a lot of resends that means you already have a bad
connection &amp; now you're filling it up with useless data).

Fix: this isn't implemented yet (help would be appreciated)... we think that
instead of saving packets for resend... a better solution would be to keep
the entity updates that went into the packet. if we don't receive an ack in
time, then put the entity updates back into the entity update queue (with
entry time from their original enqueuing). That would ensure that we send an
update for the object &amp; that the data sent is the most recent.

* One final note... per client bandwidth throttles seem to work very well.
however, our experiments with per-simulator throttles was not positive. it
appeared that a small number of clients was consuming all of the bw
available to the simulator and the rest were starved. Haven't looked into
this any more.


So...

Feedback appreciated... there is some logging code (disabled) in the branch;
real data would be great. And help testing. there are a number of
attachment, deletes and so on that i'm not sure work correctly.
