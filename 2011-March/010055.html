&gt;<i>From: &quot;Dorena Verne&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">dorena.verde at web.de</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My question asks which development will open simulator.
</I>&gt;<i>Everywhere are rumors that in later times, no OS allows entrainment 
</I>&gt;<i>of the inventory of Hypergrid more.
</I>

Dorena.. things are actually in a very good shape with the latest 
versions that are in development area... but since the last stable 
release of 0.7.0.2 (post-fixes recommended) there has been a LOT of 
development in the core, the aspects of Hypergrid, handling inventory 
transfers between grids, voice, and starting to address changes and 
enhancements that Viewer 2 can support.  This has means that the 
development versions (predictably and expected) occasionally don't 
work or have some incompatibilities with other versions.  Hence James 
aka Hiro Protagonist's suggestion that running a common version is 
best at present.

The devs are discussing shortly branching the first release 
candidates for 0.7.1 version... and once that settles down during the 
release candidate stage and becomes the stable release with luck 
there may be a prospect of much more stable hypergrid and inventory 
transfers between those who use that version (or want to link to the 
OSGrid regions which are already tuning the dev version of 0.7.1). 
Note that 0.7.1 will not be compatible with earlier HG releases such 
as 0.6.9 and 0.7.0.x for teleports within a grid or across grids.
