Thanks Mic,

I look forward to testing this. I have been chasing network issues that
show up as wildly different performance experienced by users that are in
the same simulator with others having similar connections and
workstations. A couple of weeks ago I heard about something called
bufferbloat and dark buffers in the Internet. I posted links to the
information in IRC and would like to add it here as well ...

    <A HREF="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/bloat/news">http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/bloat/news</A>
    <A HREF="http://mirrors.bufferbloat.net/Talks/BellLabs01192011/">http://mirrors.bufferbloat.net/Talks/BellLabs01192011/</A>

I think this issue may a lot of bearing on our networking in the open
Internet where packets in-transit are routed through devices with large
built-in buffering. The packets are held in these devices for forwarding
at a time that seems convenient for the device, rather than using
congestion management and dropping the packets when needed. It is
possible that a packet may experience this several times in-transit. As
the packets are held in the buffers, latency is added to the circuit and
may reach the point where we resend packets because we didn't get the
acknowledgment in time.

Hopefully this is, at least, somewhat related.

Thanks,
BlueWall
