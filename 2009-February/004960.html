</I>Actually, we don't even need to change the user base data. The inventory 
assets are only a [relatively small?] percentage of all the assets in 
the grid asset server. Most of the assets, I would say, are inworld 
things that aren't on any inventory. They are on the &quot;region's 
inventory&quot; so to speak. So we could move all regions into HG mode, 
setting the proper local servers in their OpenSim.ini's. The users 
inventory would still be OSGrid's Inventory server.

Even so, there are a few things that need changing/improving for this to 
happen. But it's not that far out.
