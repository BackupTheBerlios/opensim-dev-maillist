I don't think Opensim would have had how to have done this. Maybe it was some error in the SL client or something else that deleted it. Did you uninstall a Release Candidate or First Look viewer as well? In the past I had issues where uninstalling RC or FirstLook also removed my SL settings.

Subject: [Opensim-dev] SL settings folder has been deleted








Trying unsuccessfully a freshly compiled version of OpenSim for a few days, I decided to try the binaries version.  I installed it as indicated, as standalone.  It worked well, but....  it deleted completely my Application data Second Life folder content.  My settings plus a few years of logs I had there, keeping mainly logs of my scripters groups in SL.  Plus discussions I had with people I hire... plus.. plus...

Gee... how can this be?  Did it ever happen to anybody else?
