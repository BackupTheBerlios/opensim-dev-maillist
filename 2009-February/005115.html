<PRE>Dear Mike: 

As Dahlia said, the IdealistViewer is a good candidate as it begins to add features. Many of us have high hopes for IdealistViewer during the course of this year.


As OpenSim, we have decided to stay in SecondLife viewer compatible so we are measuring the operation and performance of OpenSim against the current SecondLife official viewer, currently 1.21.6. This does change from time to time and when it changes, we strive to stay compatible.

This SecondLife viewer represents the largest set of users for OpenSim, so this seems like a reasonable decision.

It is entirely probable that other viewers such as Hippo, IdealistViewer, OpenViewer, Xenkii, Rex and others will become widely adopted and we hope that will happen. We also hope that they will stay compatible with the SecondLife viewer, but as 2009 unfolds, it will be very interesting to see what happens.

Charles

Subject: [Opensim-dev] Any OpenSim viewers being built from scratch?

I know this isn't a viewer related dev group... but...I was wondering if anyone was building a viewer that wasn't so tied down to SecondLife? Basically a viewer that has been built from the ground up with OpenSim in mind.

The viewers so far have been the biggest OpenSim eyesore for me... if anyone knows of a viewer project targeted for OpenSim or knows someone interested in starting that kind of project please let me know or forward my email to them.

Thanks!
