<PRE>
Colin,

While there are several commercial contributors to opensim, and several
businesses that rely on the emergence of opensim as a mature platform for
enterprise, I personally feel it is timely to chart a course for a
sustained development effort at a larger scale.

Some on those this list work with or for companies which have identified
opensim as a platform for business operations, and some are employees of
multinational tech companies that would like to see opensim as a key
platform for business solutions. Some are involved in research with
opesnim, some are focused on development, and still others try to do both
at once.

We've reached a point where a great deal of progress could be made toward
reliability and hardening for enterprise with a focused and funded group of
developers brought together for the mission.  Attracting that level of
investment does require a formal process that has yet to be applied. If you
have the interest and capability, it would not be too early to apply that
process to opensim.

Success in that endeavor could help all of the businesses that rely on the
emergence opensim.

Hi,

I have been thinking about writing a Business Case for OpenSim. A Business
Case is the feasibility study performed before a full Business Plan is
written, and is equally applicable to opensource 'products'.

If such a Case has not been written before, then I would be prepared to
write one, if the core developers would like one. But beware, it could be
quite tough.

As for credentials, I used to write business cases and business plans for
News Corporation.

Let me know,

Rock
