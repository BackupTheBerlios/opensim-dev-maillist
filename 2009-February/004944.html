<PRE>Well, lets see if we can disect the problem a bit more and maybe take these issues one at a time.

I believe it may be a reasonable argument that the terrain of a region is a property of the region so that a regions terrain should be stored in the regions database and not on the assetServer database. In particular, I would argue that all the old terrain edits should be deleted from the assetServer database as they are not accessible or useful anymore.

Without even getting into any issues of inventory across regions, lets see if we can find a consensus on handling the current &quot;terrainImage&quot; that is stored on the assetServer and then go to another issue. I pick this one first as it seems more clearcut, but lets see how the discussion goes.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] AssetServer Observations and Suggestions

Hi,

I think while some alternate scenarios are possible, the real 
solution lies in pure &quot;storage providers&quot; that a user subscribes to, 
and which are grid-independent, or in local storage on the user's 
hard disk.

In the interim, we should maybe create a means to determine which 
assets can be discarded. SPecifically, scan eacha nd every prim 
asset to determine referenced textures and content items. Scan each 
region to determine inworld item asset references. Tag all items not 
found, wait a while, then judiciously delete.

Basically, the only resources that a script will reference by UUID 
are textures and sounds. Animations cannot be referenced by UUID, 
neither can other prim objects, unless god mode rez is used.
Wearables can't be referenced by asset ID either, so these will 
always have an inventory item, be it in user inventory or inworld. I 
believe that within about 6 months, equilibrium will be reached, 
e.g. a point where growth in the asset database is proportional to 
the actual number of new items created, rather than just old copies 
of edited items.

Assets on region is a bad idea, IMHO, because it means that region 
operators are responsible for the inventories of users who have no 
region at all, and user inventories would be available only if that 
region happens to be up. in OSGrid, that can't be depended on.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Additionally, it appears to me that we are also storing things that

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> terrainImage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, to the beginnings of a suggestion. It seems to me that each 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> avatar will have a &quot;home&quot; region. And that perhaps that is the place 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to store the items in an avatars inventory. Things like scripts, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notecards, textures and the like.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At that point, the assetServer on a grid could be used to store only 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pointers (or URL's) to each avatars inventory on his or her home region.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, by doing that, we start shifting the ever increasing disk storage 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requirements of a grid back to the regions distributed around the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> internet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, perhaps Cable Beach is already doing this, and if so, this is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> great. If not, I put out these ideas and duck as the tomatoes start 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flying.
