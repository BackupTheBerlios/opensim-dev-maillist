<PRE>A newly created region contains no assets (except for terrain?). Objects 
get rezzed from OAR files and by avatars moving things from their 
inventories, right? These objects reference other objects and assets 
(textures et al) either directly or via object inventory.

In principle, it is sufficient for the asset database to reflect only 
those assets required to support the set of objects considered to be part 
of the permanent region state at any given point in time. Of course, I'm 
assuming here that the assets needed by an objects that are subsequently 
rezzed can be resolved somehow. The approach we have been experimenting 
with locally is to extend the &quot;Not Found&quot; handling to search for an asset 
in a static/dynamic set of other known asset repositories. This should 
make the process transparent to all.

Weeding out abandoned assets can, as everyone has said, by examining the 
point-in-time configuration of the region's permanent state. This could be 
done by a separate process or low-priority thread. As part of this 
approach it would seem logical to have a secondary asset database. Moving 
the unreferenced assets to this &quot;apparently unused asset&quot; database. If an 
asset is not resolved in the local asset database then the first 
alternative location checked is the &quot;apparently unused asset&quot; database. 
The search continues with other independent asset servers according  to 
whatever search algorithm is in effect.

Best regards
Alan

Re: [Opensim-dev] AssetServer Observations and Suggestions



In a normal grid use scenario (OSGRID) I believe that most assets 
are _initially_ created by uploading them through the viewer. Even 
though they can be deleted, few people delete their textures, since 
they are always needed for further building. The savings would be 
minuscule, IMHO. Assets being implicitly shared, any textures passed 
to another user will link to the same inventory item, so that 
deleting something from one user's inventory doesn't mean that it is 
deleted from all users' inventories. There is no way to determine a 
reference but by scanning all inventories and all object assets.
