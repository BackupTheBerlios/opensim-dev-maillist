<PRE>Kyle, I agree...  If this does turn out to have an impact on making 
builds more efficient then perhaps it should go in as a default 
setting?  Although I wonder if that would be a server side function or 
if it would need to be client side.  It certainly will be interesting to 
see.

...  - And before I forget as my brains are about to turn into jelly, 
thank you Dahlia for your explanation.  That really does help to clarify 
just how all of this works.  :)

Thanks, :)
 - John / Orion

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around and setting as many objects as possible to phantom (telephone 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> poles, windows, tables, chairs, misc props and anything thats not needed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to keep the avatar from falling out of the buildings) it appears as 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though that server's memory usage has gone down from about 70% (740 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> megs) down to 45% (520 megs).  I would estimate that in total 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approximately 15,000 to 20,000 prims were set to phantom.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very interesting - thanks for looking into this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that in actual builds, those we see in use in SL, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, most prims don't need to be non-phantom but are, and it's not
</I>&gt;<i> surprising to find that your exercise reduces the cost.   I've
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes wondered if there's a case for saying that new prims should
</I>&gt;<i> be phantom by default, though I'm not necessarily suggesting that as a
</I>&gt;<i> course of action for OpenSim.  It certainly helps avatar movement when
</I>&gt;<i> a cleanup like you describe is done, especially with furniture,
</I>&gt;<i> poseballs etc, and it's well worth the time doing that even if only
</I>&gt;<i> for the sake of smooth operation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any indication of a corresponding drop in CPU usage,
</I>&gt;<i> especially when avatars are moving around in there?
