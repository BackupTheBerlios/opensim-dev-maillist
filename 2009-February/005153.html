<PRE>...

&gt;&gt;<i> This would mean that any grid runs into a severe problem over time.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> Yep :).  On a standalone one could implement some cleanup scheme
</I>which checks everything to see
&gt;&gt;<i> if an asset is still referenced, and deletes that asset if it is not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In grid mode this is a much more difficult problem since references
</I>are scattered across many different
&gt;&gt;<i> regions servers.  The situation is even worse if you are running a
</I>grid where not all of them are
&gt;&gt;<i> guaranteed to be connected.
</I>
But isn't that ... horrible? (in lack of a better/worse word.)

As I said yesterday, IMHO there is no real need to think about
optimizations when you have
a serious blocker like this. I would even go so far that this is a major
roadblock for grid based technologies per se. (grid as in Rosedale's
'Happily now, Second Life has been proven to exist. If we disappeared
tomorrow, the grid would be rebuilt by you.')

I take it the bad news is that any proposed solution to this breaks SL
compatibility?

Maybe now would be a good time to take a step away from it.
