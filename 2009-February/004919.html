Well, I don't mean anything that advanced; It just struck me that commands could just as well contain spaces.

It sounds to be like that may be what you are describing?

Another issue I find, not sure if it's related or not, is the inability to use the backspace key in the OpenSim console while running on various linux distributions. I don't know where this is coming from, but I wonder if it's something OpenSim could control?

Just chipping in my 2c: How about the modules are supposed to register the 'command' whatever that is, but that the 'command' can include spaces? So, &quot;create user&quot; should be a valid command, sending the remainder to that region (via the registered delegate). which means another module can register &quot;create region&quot; but not &quot;create user&quot;, as that would have already been registered. Of course, it cannot register a non-character terminated subset either, like simply &quot;create&quot;. the command parser would simply run thru the list, doing a 'starts with characters' match, probably with a non-character terminator in the regexp. (If you're really anal on performance, the whole list of matches can be concatenated into a regexp and compiled once) Of course, you would have to register &quot;help create user&quot; as well, but it seems to me that there could be an abstract base class providing some protected generative helper functions. (To either create and register verb+&quot; &quot;+noun and/or noun+&quot; &quot;+verb, and the corresponding help text in one go)This seems like the most flexible approach to me, as it poses no limitations on what commands makes the most sense for each context.Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB&gt; Date: Thu, 5 Feb 2009 18:30:25 +0100&gt; From: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">DrScofield at xyzzyxyzzy.net</A>
