I'd also like to know more about where this comes from.  Is it something required for the realXtend client?  What is its 
purpose?

Also, what are the expectations are as regards to support from us (the core team)?  At the moment, I'm presuming that if 
I needed to refactor IClientAPI (or one of its eventual sub-interfaces) and had to make some code changes to MXP client, 
then these could be made on a 'best-effort' basis - enough to get the code compiling but with no requirement to check 
that it still worked.  Any fixes would be done by someone else after the fact.

This would place it on the same level as MSSQL (and increasingly SQLite).  Changes made by core committers increasingly 
end up only being done on MySQL.
