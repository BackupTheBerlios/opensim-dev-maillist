<PRE>A couple of issues/questions are:

How would a
Region/ServiceModule say what interface it wanted to register, it might
implement a couple but only want to register one, or it might want to
register its class type.

And I'm taking it we would still have
the ApplicationPlugin that could register with what regions it wanted,
so would still need the Scene.RegisterModule&lt;&gt;() interface for
them.

Okay, it seems to me that the chief problem now is that MW would like to
exposed service module methods to regions 
without having to put any IScene methods in the module code, allowing it to be
used for both the region server and grid 
servers.

This is possible if all the service methods are exposed to the region. 
However, Melanie doesn't like this because it 
will expose some methods that regions should arguably not be able to get at
(such as 
IInventoryService.CreateNewUserInventory()).

I would tend to think that we shouldn't expose such service methods to
regions.

Neither side likes automagic by the core code, but I think a little bit of it
will help here.  Instead of having methods 
such as

void RegisterInterfaceToAllRegistries&lt;T&gt;(T iface);

we instead annotate service modules with [RegionModule] and region interfaces
with [RegionInterface].  Grid modules 
which can also provide region services are annotated in this way.  When the
core code goes to load them, the 
[RegionInterface] tagged interfaces are automatically registered with the
region registry.  This replaces 
RegisterModuleInterface().

It also requires that IServiceModule and IRegionModule are collapsed together,
by removing the IScene references in 
IRegionModule.  Instead, these are passed in via the OnNewScene() event talked
about earlier.

In this way, service/application modules that aren't interested in scenes
don't need to do any extra work apart from 
tagging the module/interfaces appropriately, avoiding the boilerplate of
separately registering the interface to each 
region.  The regions still don't have access to inter-service/non-region
interfaces.

This does require a separate service registry hidden from the Region/Scene so
that services can communicate among 
themselves (e.g. the user service needs to call the inventory service to create
new user inventories).  There would be 2 
registries in total.

Please excuse me if I haven't fully grokked all the previous posts on this
thread.
