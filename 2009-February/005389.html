<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> -          SceneGraph.Get* methods are generally very wasteful. Lots of them use the /slow/ GetEntities method to build a list of entities before searching them. This is particularly noticeable on the GetGroupByPrim(UUID) method. EntityManager should be having indexes for these frequently accessed items.
</I>
I thought some one (justin?) worked on that with the goal of adding 
indexes/making it a dict.

&gt;<i> -          Why, to send a primitive do we need to: - Mark it for updates. - Crawl through the Entities list for updates - Send updates to ClientViews, when we could just Send the update directly to viewers (EventManager.TriggerOnPrimUpdated[?])?
</I>
Because it would happen in the wrong thread context, maybe?

&gt;<i> -          Why does Scene.Heartbeat/Update do more than just updating frame-dependent things? Eg, why not keep Update to just: Update Physics, Process Scripts[?], etc. Out of it we move: Backup (timer?), Land update (when something happens+ timer?), Terrain backup (main backup thread?)
</I>
Scripts don't run in update, although movement events are generated 
there.

&gt;<i> -          Why build X copies of the same packet for fifteen separate clients? Why not re-use the update packet and change the agent IDs? Maybe some kind of 'PacketMaster' could be developed for each ClientView type which allows us to do 'bulk' operations like this.
</I>
Because of the sequence numbers. They are different for each client.
