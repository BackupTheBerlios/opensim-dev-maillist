Dear colleagues;

 

for some time now, we at Tribal Media have employed an entirely different way of logging the viewer in, with tokens, that does not constitute changing the viewer.

 

What we do, is that we install a 'launcher' app on the users computer. It serves a number of purposes:

 

1) Installs rezzme, genesis and osurl url monikers, all of them taking tokens as auxiliary data - these monikers let people log onto web sites, and launch a viewer with a pre-authenticated token by a link. (see step 5)

 

2) Identifies installed viewers, and keep track of preferreed viewer.

 

3) Provides a pre-login login form to do non-web pre-launch authentication (in this case, this would probably be where the _form_ obtains the token to pass to step 5)

 

4) Launches pre-requisite software, as the TribalVoice.exe for when voice should be enabled, or a Proxy to divert certain packets.

 

5) Launched preferred user, with seamless login (using the login option of the ll viewer with dummy data to bypass the login screen) supplying the TOKEN in a tweaked LOGINURI - an example of this loginuri would be -loginuri <A HREF="http://{loginserver">http://{loginserver</A>}/?token={token} - have a look at the login service, it has been providing overloads and aux data for some time now, just to be able to do this.

 

6) Provides for hypergrid cross-login by providing both loginuri and target region as endpoint.


While we might not want to provide all these options in OpenSim, I think our approach has worked well for us and our clients.


Most of the code for these options are actually already out there in various scattered projects.


Best regards,
Stefan Andersson

Right. The constraint here, let's not forget, is that we want to continue to reuse the LL viewer for a while.
I'm going to read that doc about OpenID tokens, but if it requires participation from the viewer, forget it... We are and will continue to be in LL Viewer hacking mode in the foreseeable future, abnd I want to make things safe before a better viewer comes along.

The bottom line question in my email, phrased in OpenID terminology, is whether we can use the Viewer's IP address as the token.

As we cannot change the viewer at the moment one could use the opensim login code to create the token...
