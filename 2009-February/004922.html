<PRE>Hi,

I'd like to share with you my progress on getting the Cable Beach
asset/inventory server into OpenSim core.

What's done:

- All plugins are loaded with Mono.Addins. This means ExtensionLoader
  is no longer used (except for its Nini configuration).

- OpenSim's database providers are used. This means we support all the
  DBs that OpenSim currently supports.

Currently I can use the asset server as a drop-in replacement for the
stock asset server to access a region. I haven't yet tested all the
asset functionality, like uploading assets, though. I can browse the
asset metadata from the browser with BrowseFrontend.

What still needs to be done:

- Currently I hardcoded which plugins are to be loaded, so some logic
  to read this from the .ini file at runtime is needed.

- Refactor all the MySQL-specific code in the storage plugins to use
  OpenSim's *AssetData and *InventoryData classes.

- Have the app use the same console as the rest of the OpenSim servers.

- Use OpenSim's Nini. Is this coupled with the OpenSim console?

- Somehow resolve the dependency on the HttpServer.dll &quot;lite version,&quot;
  either by updating the HttpServer.dll currently in OpenSim or
  modifying the new asset server to use the OpenSim's HttpServer.dll.

- General refactoring and cleaning up.

So a bit of work left to do, particularly since I'm not exactly
familiar with the OpenSim console or the HttpServer. I guess I can
commit what I have to SVN once the dependencies on the custom DLLs are
resolved (ExtensionLoader, HttpServer, some updated OpenMetaverse
libs), and the rest can be finished afterwards.

I won't be including the OpenID authentication plugin or the AmazonS3
or Memcached storage plugins at this time. I think I'll also stub out
the current MySQL code in the inventory storage for now; that can be
implemented later on.

Thanks,
Mike
