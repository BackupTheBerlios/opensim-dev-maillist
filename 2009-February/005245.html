<PRE>It serves a purpose, handles a use case, that gives little benefit 
to OpenSim.
The point is not to provide raw storage. The point would be that 
every user provides storage for _what they use_.
If OSGrid were to use tahoe for assets, and run a forced update, 
more than half the grid would be down for days!
With Tahoe, no one would have any assets in that time, because too 
many nodes would be missing.

And, we just prefer BSD.....

</I>&gt;<i> The Tahoe secure filesystem
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By Jake Edge
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> April 30, 2008
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Tahoe filesystem is designed as a secure, distributed filesystem that is
</I>&gt;<i> available as free software. Tahoe is also designed for fault tolerance so
</I>&gt;<i> that data remains available even in the presence of missing or malicious
</I>&gt;<i> peers. In March, the project released a 1.0 version which makes this a good
</I>&gt;<i> time to take a peek.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The basics of Tahoe are somewhat similar to GNUnet or Freenet in that the
</I>&gt;<i> data is encrypted and spread around to multiple nodes in the network. Unlike
</I>&gt;<i> those, though, Tahoe does not seek to provide anonymity. The nodes making up
</I>&gt;<i> a Tahoe filesystem are called a &quot;grid&quot;. Grids consist of some number of peers
</I>&gt;<i> acting as storage server nodes along with an &quot;introducer&quot; that knows all of
</I>&gt;<i> the other nodes and is the central point of contact for the grid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Files are stored in Tahoe by first being encrypted on the local machine using
</I>&gt;<i> AES. They are then broken into &quot;shares&quot;, ten by default, that are distributed
</I>&gt;<i> to different servers in the grid. Before that happens, though, the encrypted
</I>&gt;<i> file is encoded in such a way that the whole file can be recovered even if
</I>&gt;<i> only a subset of the shares can be retrieved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This encoding, known as &quot;erasure coding&quot;, is the key to the fault-tolerance
</I>&gt;<i> of the Tahoe system. By default, Tahoe encodes the shares such that
</I>&gt;<i> retrieving three of the ten is sufficient to recover the entire file. It also
</I>&gt;<i> increases the size of the file by the expected 10/3 ratio.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The suggested use case for Tahoe is a &quot;friendnet&quot; where some group of friends
</I>&gt;<i> share their storage with each other in a way that reduces or eliminates the
</I>&gt;<i> need for backups. Tahoe also has ways to share data in either read-only or
</I>&gt;<i> read-write (immutable or mutable in Tahoe-speak) modes. Tahoe is used as a
</I>&gt;<i> commercial backup system by Allmydata, sponsor of the Tahoe project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tahoe is designed to be secure, which means that it protects the integrity
</I>&gt;<i> and confidentiality of the data stored in it. SHA-256 is used extensively to
</I>&gt;<i> ensure consistency of the plaintext, ciphertext, and shares. Files stored in
</I>&gt;<i> the system are identified by long identifiers called capabilities, that look
</I>&gt;<i> something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> URI:CHK:yeyur23dw7cg3mxmsl2kiqvtt4:sdtrgczwtntzyfg2uapbfytxvyqsn45j4jpgrhcey7ebzpaoznya:3:10:107833344
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For mutable files, there are two versions of the capability, one that allows
</I>&gt;<i> only reading, while the other allows writing as well. Anyone who does not
</I>&gt;<i> have a capability string for a particular file cannot access it at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Multiple user interfaces are available for Tahoe, including a web interface,
</I>&gt;<i> a command-line interface, a FUSE extension and a web API. Tahoe is written in
</I>&gt;<i> Python, using some C extensions for efficiency. It uses the Twisted framework
</I>&gt;<i> for event handling, pycryptopp (a Python interface to the Crypto++ library)
</I>&gt;<i> for its encryption needs, and zfec for the erasure coding. All of the Tahoe
</I>&gt;<i> code is available under the GPL.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Installing Tahoe was fairly straightforward&#8212;there were a few hiccups which
</I>&gt;<i> have since been resolved&#8212;using the installation guide. Joining the test grid
</I>&gt;<i> was as easy as putting an introducer identifier into a file and starting
</I>&gt;<i> Tahoe from the command line. In some basic testing, it seems to work quite
</I>&gt;<i> well, overall, though it did not seem to use available bandwidth as
</I>&gt;<i> efficiently as it might.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This brief overview only scratches the surface of the information available
</I>&gt;<i> about Tahoe; there is much more on the documentation page. For anyone
</I>&gt;<i> interested in distributed, secure, and/or fault-tolerant filesystems, Tahoe
</I>&gt;<i> is definitely worth a look.
