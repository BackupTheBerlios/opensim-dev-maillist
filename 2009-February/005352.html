<PRE>Thank you for letting me be the example. I find this exchange very stimulating. Much more so then some of the posturing going on in certain IETF mailing list right now.

I have not given a whole lot of thought to security before, but I can see that we are going to go around on this for a while. As I think about it, the opensource method of describing the details, finding the flaws and then solving them one at a time is a much more refreshing method then the typical security conversations I have which usually end up as &quot;you are not allowed to know how this works&quot;

With Respect
Charles 

p.s. &quot;Sports Illuminated&quot;. I like that one.

With all grids being independent of one another, or in the
example given by John, maybe use an &quot;openid.osgrid.org/users/screenname&quot;

For those of you who don't know, this already exists. Click this:

Again, in this example Charles happens to have his identity at
OSGrid, but that's not a requirement of the exchange. It could just as
easily been an identity from another grid.
 
This way various grids could all run &quot;openID&quot; servers, and trust
agreements would need to be established between the various grids.
I'm not going to act on anything that suggests &quot;trust agreements
between various grids.&quot; That's an AWG concept that I very much disagree
with, and want no part in. I have no problem with companies cutting
corners on security in order to be able to exchange agents on a
lawyer-backed up trust basis. But that's not what I'm doing here, and
that's not what a lot of people want OpenSim to be.

The goal is to be able to go from my home standalone to *any* sim out
there that I know nothing about, and still be sure that nothing bad
will happen to my belongings. Anything less than this is not acceptable
as a goal, for me.
