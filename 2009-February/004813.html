Here's what happens. Foreign users carry around information about their 
servers (user, inventory, home region, etc) that is stored on their 
run-time profile cached in the regions. When they go from an HG region 
to another HG region, that information is passed on via the message 
expect_hg_user, which only HG regions understand. When they go from an 
HG region to a non-HG region, the receiving region doesn't understand 
that message, so it knows nothing about those servers for the foreign 
user. If the TP is far enough away, the profile is removed from the 
departing HG region (as normal for all TPs), so the user's servers info 
is permanently lost for the rest of the session. Even if the user comes 
back to the HG region, the information has been lost.

Without that information the foreign user cannot: access inventory 
(except for the items that are cached in the viewer), go back home, etc...

So jumping from an HG region to a non-HG region on the same grid is ok, 
in the sense that it doesn't crash anything, and that the user's agent 
is is able to interact with the world, but that user becomes impaired in 
many ways. The user is still able to chat, build &amp; move things (if 
allowed), TP around, etc. It's just the interaction with his/her home 
servers that is impaired.
