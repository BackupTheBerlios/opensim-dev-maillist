<PRE>No one would sue over a $0.05 shirt. The point of technical copy 
protection is not to block copying. It is to make it require 
criminal energy.
You can't do it accidentally, or because you don't know better, it 
prevents &quot;casual copying&quot;. You need to invest criminal energy, 
either by downloading software that does it for you, or by writing 
it. That proves intent. Which is what you need, in several 
countries, of you _do_ want to get them slammed for more than just 
the price of the item.
If you can prove intent, the $0.05 shirt can translate into $1000 in 
penalties - and that is what a creator wants.
