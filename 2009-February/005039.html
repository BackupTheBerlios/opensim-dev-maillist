I do agree with you.  I think that the important thing here is that the patch creator and applier both think carefully 
about the situation when private members are being made protected.

One advantage of private members is that they tend to make debugging and reasoning about code considerably easier.  For 
instance, if I know no other code can call a particular method because it is private, then that means I don't need to 
hunt down references or reason about possible interactions between different callers.  However, these arguments are 
stronger, I think, when fields are public rather than protected (I have spent too much time trying to unpick 
interactions with Scene where callers were directly manipulating public fields where this was not desirable or necessary).

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> For the interested, I suggest you google for religious flame wars on the 
</I>&gt;<i> proper use of &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;sealed&quot; as well. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, I take your +1's as meaning we're discussing this in order 
</I>&gt;<i> to form an explicit concensus - if I have recieved no strong objections, 
</I>&gt;<i> I will add this to the code conventions by friday 20/2 2009.
</I>
Well, you know, I was just idly agreeing with you :)  But it would be good to have such things in the code conventions.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards,
