</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The key: capabilities.
</I>&gt;<i> The implications to OpenSim: enormous.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First a bit of history about CAPs in OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  From what I understand, CAPs in OpenSim has been a reactive process of 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The Lindens added X over CAPs; let's find the simplest possible thing 
</I>&gt;<i> that makes the client happy.&quot; As a result, when I first started looking 
</I>&gt;<i> at TPs etc. there was one single CAP seed per agent that was passed 
</I>&gt;<i> around throughout all the regions that the agent visited, and that was 
</I>&gt;<i> used to set up CAP URLs with virtually identical paths. The use of 
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities as security devices was completely defeated; yes, the 
</I>&gt;<i> client wasn't unhappy, it worked, but we were far away from implementing 
</I>&gt;<i> CAPs-as-secrets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then I started fiddling with that, and changed things so that each 
</I>&gt;<i> region has its own CAPs seed per agent. However, the purpose of CAPs for 
</I>&gt;<i> security is still completely defeated, because the regions know each 
</I>&gt;<i> other's seed caps. In fact, seed caps are being generated by the 
</I>&gt;<i> departing regions for the receiving regions so that we can implement 
</I>&gt;<i> agents transfers the way we do now:
</I>&gt;<i> eq.EnableSimulator(reg.RegionHandle, endPoint, avatar.UUID);
</I>&gt;<i> eq.EstablishAgentCommunication(avatar.UUID, endPoint, ***capsPath***);
</I>&gt;<i> eq.TeleportFinishEvent(reg.RegionHandle, 13, endPoint, 4, teleportFlags, 
</I>&gt;<i> ***capsPath***, avatar.UUID);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The departing region that runs the code above needs to know the caps 
</I>&gt;<i> seed path of the receiving region, so it can send it to the client. 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, completely defeats the purpose of CAPs being secrets.
</I>
Ah interesting point - I hadn't considered this before.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's rewind. The idea behind caps is that they are opaque URLs that are 
</I>&gt;<i> a shared secret URL between the CAP giver, the CAP receiver, and the 
</I>&gt;<i> CAP-function provider. The CAP receiver is the viewer. The viewer 
</I>&gt;<i> understands (i.e. has semantics for) a number of capability-enabled 
</I>&gt;<i> functions such as the seed itself, Event Queue, NoteCard and Script 
</I>&gt;<i> updates, ... and, yes, even Inventory access! As far as we know, the 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics is defined by a mapping from pre-defined names to the CAP URLs 
</I>&gt;<i> that we send to the viewer. For example, whenever the viewer wants to 
</I>&gt;<i> update a notecard in the agent's inventory, it simply posts to the URL 
</I>&gt;<i> we gave it associated with the name &quot;UpdateNotecardAgentInventory&quot;. The 
</I>&gt;<i> viewer doesn't know what's behind that URL; that's up to (a) the 
</I>&gt;<i> capability giver to establish who the provider is and (b) to the 
</I>&gt;<i> capability provider to implement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so the fundamental flaw in our thinking so far is that the *regions* 
</I>&gt;<i> are both, and always, the CAPs generators/givers and the CAP-function 
</I>&gt;<i> providers. (With one notable exception of the initial CAPs seed, which 
</I>&gt;<i> is generated by the UserLoginService for the first region). This is 
</I>&gt;<i> flawed because we can't trust the regions in general. We definitely 
</I>&gt;<i> can't have a single seed being passed around the regions, and we also 
</I>&gt;<i> can't have the departing region generate the CAPs seed for the receiving 
</I>&gt;<i> region.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, and this is even more radical, we also can't have the 
</I>&gt;<i> regions post events to the Event Queue! I'll get to this a little 
</I>&gt;<i> further down.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The right way of thinking, at a high level, is this: the CAPs 
</I>&gt;<i> generator/giver must be a trusted component. We can't trust regions in 
</I>&gt;<i> general (only a few home ones), so we can't let CAPs be handled by the 
</I>&gt;<i> regions in general -- period. In an open grid system we can only trust 
</I>&gt;<i> the User server, and the servers that it trusts such as the home region 
</I>&gt;<i> and the user's inventory server. Hence the user server is the only 
</I>&gt;<i> component that should ever give out CAPs URLs (or delegate that function 
</I>&gt;<i> to a trusted component).
</I>
I guess the obvious issue here is that while this isn't an issue for hypergrid, in an open grid environment the user 
service becomes a potential bottleneck, though perhaps one which is fairly easily scalable (just load balance over 
multiple user services).  There would also be an extra delay when region crossing/teleporting while messages are 
exchanged with the trusted component over the network.  What do you think about this?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *Implications*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The implications for how we do things are enormous. For example, 
</I>&gt;<i> teleports. The right way of doing TPs safely should be to have the 
</I>&gt;<i> user/presence/homeregion server do them, not the regions. Something like 
</I>&gt;<i> this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - client requests TP on the untrusted region A to untrusted region B
</I>&gt;<i> - untrusted region A may do whatever it wants with that request, but 
</I>&gt;<i> let's start by the base case: it complies with the request
</I>&gt;<i> - region A notifies *the user server* that the agent wants to TP to region B
</I>&gt;<i> - User server posts EnableSimulator for B on *a trusted* Event Queue
</I>&gt;<i> - User server posts EnableChildAgent for B on that queue, with a CAP 
</I>&gt;<i> seed *pointing to a trusted component*, so that precludes B
</I>&gt;<i> - Client gets that, and invokes the seed cap to get all the CAP URLs
</I>&gt;<i> - User server proceeds to spawn the agent in B
</I>&gt;<i> - User server posts TeleportFinish on the trusted queue with that same 
</I>&gt;<i> CAP seed
</I>&gt;<i> - Client does CompleteMovementIntoRegion, as normal
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Attachments should also be posted by the User server onto B, and not by A.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [In all of the above, read &quot;user server&quot; as &quot;user server or a trusted 
</I>&gt;<i> component&quot;; it could be the user's home region, for example; so there 
</I>&gt;<i> could be only one Event Queue ever, at the home region. Yey!]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another critical example: inventory. The CAP URL for this should be 
</I>&gt;<i> pointing directly to the Inventory server, not to the regions. I 
</I>&gt;<i> understand that inventory over CAPs had some issues in the past. I just 
</I>&gt;<i> fiddled with it this morning, and it's working -- I'm sure there are 
</I>&gt;<i> problems that I'm not seeing here on my standalone, but the basics seem 
</I>&gt;<i> to be there. That is, I gave it this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                 m_capsHandlers[&quot;FetchInventoryDescendents&quot;] =
</I>&gt;<i>                     new RestStreamHandler(&quot;POST&quot;, capsBase + 
</I>&gt;<i> m_fetchInventoryPath, FetchInventoryRequest2);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and the viewer compliantly posted to this URL when I accessed my 
</I>&gt;<i> inventory, instead of using UDP. So there's something here waiting to be 
</I>&gt;<i> used.
</I>
Interesting.  I can't remember if the last time this was switched on the whole thing wasn't working or whether just some 
particular aspect of it was broken.  I suspect it was the latter.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *Bottom line*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are still a lot of things that I don't know if/how they work, and 
</I>&gt;<i> lots and lots of details that are unclear, so I'm not sure this is 
</I>&gt;<i> feasible. BUT -- I just wanted to launch the idea of turning the tables 
</I>&gt;<i> upside down on how we do things, using CAPs in a completely different 
</I>&gt;<i> way than we have been using them. This CAPs mechanism follows the 
</I>&gt;<i> general idea of moving functions away from the regions, which is our 
</I>&gt;<i> main goal for secure interoperability. I'm not sure it's &quot;the right&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism, but we really haven't explored it at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your thoughts appreciated, especially from those who have tried using 
</I>&gt;<i> inventory over CAPs before and from those who know the LL servers from 
</I>&gt;<i> the libomv end and from everyone else who knows about these things.
