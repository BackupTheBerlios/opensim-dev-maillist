<PRE>I saw an example of this once - an app that takes a mesh and creates
a conversion to SL prims. The problem is that it took a long time to
rez, and the prim geometry was more detailed than necessary (given
that the problem is to render a mesh (which the prims are already).
I would say it might be better to use a renderer that incorporates meshes,
such as realxtend if that meets your needs. I recently uploaded a basic 
stress
test that incorporates a mesh, two region modules, lsl and python
scripts....: see the first video in: <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/user/metaphorz.">http://www.youtube.com/user/metaphorz.</A>

</I>&gt;<i> import a mesh in-world in the forum of many primitives arranged next 
</I>&gt;<i> to one another to simulate that exact shape?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lets say I model something in a 3D modeling application and export it

</I>&gt;<i> then from the console write something like &quot;importmodel mymodel.ase&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim would read the model, see how it's made and create primitives 
</I>&gt;<i> to respect that shape as close as possible (a box prim for every 
</I>&gt;<i> face). For instance, if my mesh was a 5 side cylinder and I'd attempt 
</I>&gt;<i> to use this tool, Opensim would generate 5 tapered boxes arranged like 
</I>&gt;<i> this &lt;<A HREF="http://img252.imageshack.us/img252/1299/meshexampleig3.jpg">http://img252.imageshack.us/img252/1299/meshexampleig3.jpg</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No converter could probably be smart enough to use primitives like 
</I>&gt;<i> cylinders, spheres or any other types in places it could use them in, 
</I>&gt;<i> so every mesh would be represented from boxes tapered and positioned 
</I>&gt;<i> accordingly... basically a box primitive would represent each face. 
</I>&gt;<i> The converter could also place the clear texture on the hidden faces 
</I>&gt;<i> on the insides of the object and automatically link everything into a 
</I>&gt;<i> linkset. Also the UV mapping of every specific face of the model could 
</I>&gt;<i> be set as the texture mapping on every box, so one could just upload 
</I>&gt;<i> the texture after 'importing' the model and place it on the object.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know how that could be done but the idea seemed too 
</I>&gt;<i> interesting to keep for myself. Sculpt prims could not reach such a 
</I>&gt;<i> level of detail nor contain any holes in the model so this would allow 
</I>&gt;<i> realXtend-like meshes in the normal Opensim / SL (of course under a 
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable number of polys otherwise the converter could use thousands 
</I>&gt;<i> of boxes). What do you think?
