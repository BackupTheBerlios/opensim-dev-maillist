<PRE>OpenSim can _not_ provide a core module that links with Tahoe.

Tahoe is GPL, not LGPL, so anything using it must be GPL as well. If 
you create a forge module that is GPL, link to Tahoe from there, and 
a user installs that module, they will be fine. OpenSim can't touch 
Tahoe with a 10 ft. pole.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They would not be able to make a closed source product that bundles

</I>&gt;<i> I'm sorry, am not a lawyer so perhaps should not be posting about these

</I>&gt;<i> usage .. but can a 3rd party plugin for using them together still 
</I>&gt;<i> exist? I'm sure it can it an at least internally if I don't tell

</I>&gt;<i> I sure hope this doesn't explose to a huge license discussion, please
