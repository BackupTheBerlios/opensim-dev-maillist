</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Justin wondered whether we need an Init* method at all or if we just

</I>&gt;<i> that's more or less syntactic sugar...
</I>
Fair enough - though I think I was messing about more with the need for Init() and Close() at all.  But this was 
something of a mental experiment - it does make things more readable and reduce the need for conditions if there are 
such explicit methods.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> About the configuration: I don't like the idea of getting the config
</I>&gt;<i> from the scene much, because (at least currently), configuration is
</I>&gt;<i> owned by the server, not by one of its regions/scenes. While I
</I>&gt;<i> understand that some modules won't need a configuration, having to add
</I>&gt;<i> the Nini reference for a fresh region-module doesn't seem too
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to me (the currently available ones already have that
</I>&gt;<i> reference, so no change there). Even if we change that and will have
</I>&gt;<i> region-specific parts of the configuration, the config as a whole will
</I>&gt;<i> still be in the responsibility of the server, not the region, in my
</I>&gt;<i> opinion.
</I>
Also fair enough from my perspective.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We need a possibility to disable modules  (preferably without first
</I>&gt;<i> loading them) without removing the *.dll; and there were some wishes
</I>&gt;<i> about the loader, pro and contra Mono.Addins. I think I'll have a look
</I>&gt;<i> at Mono.Addins (including the IPlugin interface and the
</I>&gt;<i> disable-by-config); it's the one we use already, and I agree that we
</I>&gt;<i> should use only one loader, if possible without having to use too many
</I>&gt;<i> workarounds. If not, ExtensionLoader might win ;-)
</I>
I feel that using ExtensionLoader here is effectively the same decision as using it everywhere, since in the long term I 
really don't think that we want multiple module systems.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;what happens to avatars that are in a region that you want to restart
</I>&gt;<i> then? are they kicked out first? should they stay?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> As the region goes down, they can't stay. So, either they will be
</I>&gt;<i> moved away (TP home, maybe?) or they will be kicked out. Kicking them
</I>&gt;<i> out might be the easier thing (and consistent with the SL behavior,
</I>&gt;<i> too); TP home might be difficult if it is the home-region that is
</I>&gt;<i> restarted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I plan to do the move in an as compatible way as possible; if
</I>&gt;<i> everything works as intended, the &quot;old&quot; modules will continue to work
</I>&gt;<i> for a time. The move will happen in several steps
</I>&gt;<i> - Implementation of the new module system (while keeping the old one functional)
</I>&gt;<i> - Marking the old one as deprecated
</I>&gt;<i> - Moving over all the available core region modules to the new system
</I>&gt;<i> - Removing the old region module system
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Especially the third part will take some time (not because it is hard,
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it is, but because we have quite a few modules)...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all the contributions :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any last comments?
</I>
Go Homer!

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>   Homer
