<PRE>What we plan to do at our next Regatta is use an Amazon cloud for the event and HG to it. We ran yesterday's regatta on an EC2 instance and it had excellent xscript performance. This will further accomplish total removal of neighbor region laggy influences and superior load handling.

It has been reported that LL's Blake Sea opening event, yesterday, was a technical disaster and our OSG vastly out performed them... ty dev team

  &gt;&gt; we have two simulators with one region each running with hypergrid
  &gt;&gt; turned on. we want &quot;foreign&quot; users to go through one of the gateways
  &gt;&gt; to get into our grid. i know that the users can freely teleport around
  &gt;&gt; our grid once they have hypergrid teleported to a gateway region. what
  &gt;&gt; are the *expected* capabilities for that kind of users once the leave
  &gt;&gt; the hypergrid enabled region and move around the rest of our grid?
  &gt;&gt;
  &gt;&gt;   
  &gt; [Sorry, moving this again to -dev, because I can't access my outgoing 
  &gt; server on the other account while I'm traveling]
  &gt; 
  &gt; Here's what happens. Foreign users carry around information about their 
  &gt; servers (user, inventory, home region, etc) that is stored on their 
  &gt; run-time profile cached in the regions. When they go from an HG region 
  &gt; to another HG region, that information is passed on via the message 
  &gt; expect_hg_user, which only HG regions understand. When they go from an 
  &gt; HG region to a non-HG region, the receiving region doesn't understand 
  &gt; that message, so it knows nothing about those servers for the foreign 
  &gt; user. If the TP is far enough away, the profile is removed from the 
  &gt; departing HG region (as normal for all TPs), so the user's servers info 
  &gt; is permanently lost for the rest of the session. Even if the user comes 
  &gt; back to the HG region, the information has been lost.
  &gt; 
  &gt; Without that information the foreign user cannot: access inventory 
  &gt; (except for the items that are cached in the viewer), go back home, etc...
  &gt; 
  &gt; So jumping from an HG region to a non-HG region on the same grid is ok, 
  &gt; in the sense that it doesn't crash anything, and that the user's agent 
  &gt; is is able to interact with the world, but that user becomes impaired in 
  &gt; many ways. The user is still able to chat, build &amp; move things (if 
  &gt; allowed), TP around, etc. It's just the interaction with his/her home 
  &gt; servers that is impaired.
