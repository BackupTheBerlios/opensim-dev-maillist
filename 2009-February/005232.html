Having done some right management implementation, I would guess this is only
fixable by a right management system.


The possibility to adjust rights (who is allowed to do what) must be bound
to the single object, rather than using a ACL-based concept.

If you want to read some thoughts about this:
<A HREF="http://opensim.cybertechnews.org/?p=167">http://opensim.cybertechnews.org/?p=167</A> 

I think opensim is far away from that now and a trusted stack is difficult
to implement in an open source environment - still possible.

Would need some mid-term planning and work.

The good part: openID is in place already.


If we don&#180;t go to RM, someone with administrative rights will ever be able
to steal wathever he likes.


Cheers,
Ralf

The issue I have with the concept is one of copyright. I may not 
grant the right to keep a local copy of an asset, because I may not 
want it to work on local installations or another grid, I may not 
want to give up my script source.
