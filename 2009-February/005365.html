<PRE>+1 (actually more then 1, but then people will get suspicious :-) ).

Absolutely in favor of this.

Betreff: [Opensim-dev] On solving Authentication and such
 

By the way,

 

I've been talking to some people lately around various viewer and protocol issues, and I have come to realize that we are apparently locked into the mindset of having the viewer being the 'community application' - I would propose another frame of mind, separating whatever should be done in 3D as a separate experience from what should be done in 2D. Of course, they should interleave, but they should not have to be implemented in the same codebase.

 

Huh? I hear you say.

 

To put it otherwise; the ideal setup would be a 3D rendering surface optionally with 2D web surfaces superimposed on it. From there, the 3D rendering surface should talk some real-time protocol to a 3D scene streaming service (aka the region server) but the 2D web surfaces should communicate with Web 2.0 services.

 

This would allow us to break the issues apart, and having various competencies working on various domains, as well as letting the application coders slice the cookie anyway they want.

 

So, what I'm saying is, in short: Let's start breaking stuff out of the viewer context, and onto other user interfaces, like the web or third-party admin tools.

 

I should have my preferred IM client, not my viewer.

 

I should have my (web-based?) inventory tool, not my viewer.

 

I should log in thru my social network, not my viewer.

 

I should transfer and administrate content thru aux means (web, file, blog, e-mail, ftp, burn) not trhu the viewer.

 

et c.

 

Sure, we should always be able to do it thru clients that provide adequate tools, but hey, let's break free of the centralized monolith app thinking.

 

Ps, what's the difference with having windows on top of each others in the 3D surface, and having windows on top of each others on the desktop?
