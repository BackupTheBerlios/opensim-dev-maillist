<PRE>A RADIUS server is a solution to the problem of authentication. OpenID is a solution for federated identity, and plays nicely with any authentication solution you want to use. I think the description of this particular problem is closer to identity verification across administrative domains than defining a common login protocol, so the OpenID + token systems sound like the right approach. However, this would currently have to happen purely as communication between backend services since we can't change the viewer. A possible flow might be:

(OSGrid)-&gt;(UCI) &quot;User <A HREF="http://www.osgrid.org/users/Charles_Krinke">http://www.osgrid.org/users/Charles_Krinke</A> is teleporting to you. His token is abcdef&quot;
(UCI)-&gt;(<A HREF="http://www.osgrid.org/users/Charles_Krinke">http://www.osgrid.org/users/Charles_Krinke</A>) &quot;I have the token abcdef, is that a valid session token for Charles?&quot;
(UCI)&lt;-(<A HREF="http://www.osgrid.org/users/Charles_Krinke">http://www.osgrid.org/users/Charles_Krinke</A>) &quot;Yes it is&quot;
(OSGrid)&lt;-(UCI) &quot;That worked, thanks. Teleport is finished&quot;

Notice that Charles happens to have his identity at OSGrid, but that's not a requirement of the exchange. It could just as easily been an identity from another grid, which will be useful for teleporting from UCI to ScienceSim.

</I>&gt;<i>Crista,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The bottom line question in my email, phrased in OpenID terminology,
</I>&gt;<i>is whether we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can use the Viewer's IP address as the token.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My question is, would you really want to use the Viewer's IP address as
</I>&gt;<i>the token?  What IP address would it specifically use?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If a user were on an internal LAN, would it use the 192.168.1.x IP
</I>&gt;<i>address (local internal LAN address) or 10.x.x.x?  or 172.x.x.x?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Or would it use the external routable IP address (from the ISP)?  If
</I>&gt;<i>that were the case, then wouldn't 2 viewers that are accessing a server
</I>&gt;<i>from the same location (for example a library, or school, or
</I>&gt;<i>work/office) where multiple computers on the same internal LAN would try
</I>&gt;<i>to connect to an external grid server, then wouldn't the viewer's all
</I>&gt;<i>have the same IP address?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Keep in mind, that most users are using NAT behind their firewall, so
</I>&gt;<i>what IP address would you even use for the token?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>A better address would be the hostname address (<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">hostname at domain.com</A>).
</I>&gt;<i>This way each and every machine would always hava a unique hostname, and
</I>&gt;<i>it's tied to a specifc domain (whether it's an internal domain, a LAN,
</I>&gt;<i>or even the WAN/ISP domain name given by your local ISP, such as a local
</I>&gt;<i>comcast user:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">hostname at be-70-ar01.area1.il.chicago.comcast.net</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It might make more sense to use hostname instead of an IP address.  So
</I>&gt;<i>maybe use the machine's full FQDN hostname as the token?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I still think a RADIUS server would be the best bet (the solution I
</I>&gt;<i>described in the message below), as the best possible longterm solution
</I>&gt;<i>to this problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We would probably need to create some type of &quot;RADIUS&quot; module for
</I>&gt;<i>OpenSim.

</I>&gt;<i>               Crista,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               Sounds like you are on the right track.  Sounds like a very
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;logical&quot; process, but why not use something like 802.1x/EAP?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               &gt; So, what can we do to detect the legitimacy of agents?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               Instead of a &quot;Finnish Magic&quot;, why not use 802.1x and use a
</I>&gt;<i>RADIUS server for standard authentication?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               Using simple 802.1x, the authenticator sends an &quot;EAP-
</I>&gt;<i>Request/Identity&quot; packet to the supplicant as soon as it detects that
</I>&gt;<i>the link is active (the user has associated with the grid/radius
</I>&gt;<i>server).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               1.      The supplicant sends an &quot;EAP-Response/Identity&quot; packet
</I>&gt;<i>to the authenticator, which is then passed on to the authentication
</I>&gt;<i>(RADIUS) server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               2.      The authentication server sends back a challenge to
</I>&gt;<i>the authenticator, such as with a token password system. The
</I>&gt;<i>authenticator unpacks this from IP and repackages it into EAPOL and
</I>&gt;<i>sends it to the supplicant. Different authentication methods will vary
</I>&gt;<i>this message and the total number of messages. EAP supports client-only
</I>&gt;<i>authentication and strong mutual authentication. Only strong mutual
</I>&gt;<i>authentication is considered appropriate for the virtual world case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               3.      The supplicant responds to the challenge via the
</I>&gt;<i>authenticator and passes the response onto the authentication server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               4.      If the supplicant provides proper identity, the
</I>&gt;<i>authentication server responds with a success message, which is then
</I>&gt;<i>passed onto the supplicant. The authenticator now allows access to the
</I>&gt;<i>LAN- - possibly restricted based on attributes that came back from the
</I>&gt;<i>authentication server. For example, the authenticator might switch the
</I>&gt;<i>supplicant to a particular virtual LAN or install a set of firewall
</I>&gt;<i>rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               802.1x is a standard, and many wireless LAN vendors have
</I>&gt;<i>latched onto 802.1x standard to help authenticate and secure both wired
</I>&gt;<i>and wireless LANs.  The greatest feature of 802.1x is interoperability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               It would seem to make sense to just use 802.1x
</I>&gt;<i>authentication, EAP is supposed to head off proprietary authentication
</I>&gt;<i>systems and let everything from passwords to challenge-response tokens
</I>&gt;<i>and public-key infrastructure certificates all work smoothly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               Why not just use a standard RADIUS server as the
</I>&gt;<i>authentication server?  With 802.1x, the user or client that wants to be
</I>&gt;<i>authenticated would be called a &quot;supplicant&quot;.  The actual server doing
</I>&gt;<i>the authentication (typically a RADIUS server) is called the
</I>&gt;<i>authentication server.  The device in between (such as a wireless access
</I>&gt;<i>point, or any region/grid server) is called the &quot;authenticator&quot;.  One of
</I>&gt;<i>the key points is that the authenticator can be simple and dumb, all of
</I>&gt;<i>the &quot;brains&quot; have to be in the supplicant and the authentication server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               Each Grid could run their own separate RADIUS server, and
</I>&gt;<i>user groups could be setup to allow users to &quot;hypergrid&quot; between grids
</I>&gt;<i>(securely).  [By setting up REALMS between Grids]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               Each grid would be responsible for checking the &quot;legitimacy&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>of it's users (via E-mail confirmation, etc.) and if any user was &quot;up to
</I>&gt;<i>no good&quot; then their user ID can be disabled, and their IP address can be
</I>&gt;<i>blocked (by the RADIUS server).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               Using a standard FreeRADIUS server would make it extremely
</I>&gt;<i>easy for Grid Administrators to Administer User accounts.  RADIUS would
</I>&gt;<i>provide centralized access, authentication and accounting management for
</I>&gt;<i>users of the Grid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               If someone attempted to &quot;hijack&quot; a secure session, the
</I>&gt;<i>RADIUS server checks that the information is correct using
</I>&gt;<i>authentication schemes like PAP, CHAP or EAP.  The RADIUS server than
</I>&gt;<i>returns one of three responses (&quot;Yea&quot;, &quot;Nay&quot;, or &quot;Challenge&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               The &quot;Access Challenge&quot; requests additional information from
</I>&gt;<i>the user (such as a secondary password, or a PIN number, mother's maiden
</I>&gt;<i>name, secret password, or a token or even a secureID card, biometrics,
</I>&gt;<i>etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               Similar to how a web-based online banking system (like Bank
</I>&gt;<i>of America) works.  If you are using the same computer all the time, it
</I>&gt;<i>only asks for your username and password.  If you attempt to login from
</I>&gt;<i>a new or different computer, then it kicks back an Access Challenge, and
</I>&gt;<i>asks you for additional information (like a secret password, or a PIN,
</I>&gt;<i>or to verify your mother's maiden name, or any of several challenge
</I>&gt;<i>passwords that only the actual user would know).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               If the Challenge is successful, then the secure tunnel is
</I>&gt;<i>established between the user machine and the RADIUS server (and access
</I>&gt;<i>credentials are completely hidden).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               By using RADIUS, we could also grant users access by groups.
</I>&gt;<i>There could be an &quot;Administrators&quot; groups setup, and &quot;Moderator&quot; groups,
</I>&gt;<i>and &quot;Peace Keepers&quot; groups, and various groups with certain permissions
</I>&gt;<i>setup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               Also certain information is stored in the RADIUS server (IP
</I>&gt;<i>address of the user, maximum length that the user may remain connected,
</I>&gt;<i>an access list, priority queue or other restrictions on a user's access,
</I>&gt;<i>VLAN parameters, QoS parameters, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               RADIUS is commonly used to facilitate roaming between ISPs,
</I>&gt;<i>for example by companies which provide a single global set of
</I>&gt;<i>credentials that are usable on many public networks. RADIUS facilitates
</I>&gt;<i>this by the use of realms, which identify where the RADIUS server should
</I>&gt;<i>forward the AAA requests for processing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               A realm is commonly appended to a user's user name and
</I>&gt;<i>delimited with an '@' sign, resembling an email address domain name.
</I>&gt;<i>This is known a postfix notation for the realm. Another common usage is
</I>&gt;<i>prefix notation, which involves prepending the realm to the username and
</I>&gt;<i>using '\' as a delimiter.  Modern RADIUS servers allow any character to
</I>&gt;<i>be used as a realm delimiter, although in practice '@' and '\' are
</I>&gt;<i>usually used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               Realms can also be compounded using both prefix and postfix
</I>&gt;<i>notation, to allow for complicated roaming scenarios; for example,
</I>&gt;<i>somedomain.com &lt;<A HREF="http://somedomain.com/">http://somedomain.com/</A>&gt; \<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">username at anotherdomain.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i>could be a valid username with two realms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               Although realms often resemble email domains, it is
</I>&gt;<i>important to note that realms are in fact arbitrary text and need not
</I>&gt;<i>contain real domain names.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               So users from different Grids could roam freely between
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;partnering&quot; Grid servers using realms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               Proxy operations
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               When a RADIUS server receives an AAA request for a user name
</I>&gt;<i>containing a realm, the server will reference a table of configured
</I>&gt;<i>realms. If the realm is known, the server will then proxy the request to
</I>&gt;<i>the configured home server for that domain. The behaviour of the
</I>&gt;<i>proxying server regarding the removal of the realm from the request
</I>&gt;<i>(&quot;stripping&quot;) is configuration-dependent on most servers. In addition,
</I>&gt;<i>the proxying server can be configured to add, remove or rewrite AAA
</I>&gt;<i>requests when they are proxied.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               I believe the first step would be to get a RADIUS server
</I>&gt;<i>setup and working, and then work on setting up two grids together (using
</I>&gt;<i>REALM between the two RADIUS servers) and then once this could be done,
</I>&gt;<i>then later additional grids could be &quot;trusted&quot; and allowed onto the
</I>&gt;<i>network.  So users could roam freely between the &quot;trusted grids&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               If a user was reported to the Grid Owner (as being an
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;abusive user&quot;) then the Grid owner would suspend that user's account,
</I>&gt;<i>and send an &quot;abuse notification&quot; to the Grid Owner (that the user has
</I>&gt;<i>violated the Terms of Service for the Grid).  Basically just &quot;pull the
</I>&gt;<i>plug&quot; on that user's account, and kick them off the grid, and ban their
</I>&gt;<i>computer &amp; IP address.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               It would make it extremely easy for &quot;policing&quot; the Grid, and
</I>&gt;<i>any users that want &quot;Secure Inter-Grid&quot; handshakes would just join the
</I>&gt;<i>REALM network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                                     Mark
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>               P.S. If you need some help with this, I'm sure we can sit
</I>&gt;<i>down and discuss it a bit, and set something up as a &quot;demo&quot; grid as to
</I>&gt;<i>how this could be done.  Then later other Grids (like OS Grid, and
</I>&gt;<i>various others) could join the REALM grid network.

</I>&gt;<i>                       Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       I'm about to start tightening the ropes for the
</I>&gt;<i>Hypergrid in order to
</I>&gt;<i>                       make it safer, and also make safer some loose ends of
</I>&gt;<i>OpenSim without
</I>&gt;<i>                       HG, and I would appreciate feedback on this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       The first issue that needs to be addressed is the
</I>&gt;<i>issue of user
</I>&gt;<i>                       authentication. The regions need to be able to verify
</I>&gt;<i>that the agent
</I>&gt;<i>                       that claims to be representing
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Charles.Krinke at osgrid.org</A> is, indeed,
</I>&gt;<i>                       representing <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">Charles.Krinke at osgrid.org.</A> (As you know,
</I>&gt;<i>right now this
</I>&gt;<i>                       is... err... a bit overlooked... *coughs*... and not
</I>&gt;<i>just in the HG...
</I>&gt;<i>                       *more coughs*).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       Having looked at OpenID, I came to the conclusion that
</I>&gt;<i>it's not enough
</I>&gt;<i>                       to know that osgrid.org &lt;<A HREF="http://osgrid.org/">http://osgrid.org/</A>&gt;  has a
</I>&gt;<i>user named &quot;Charles Krinke&quot;, and we
</I>&gt;<i>                       certainly don't want Charles to be constantly typing
</I>&gt;<i>his password
</I>&gt;<i>                       everytime he moves; the region needs to know that this
</I>&gt;<i>user is already
</I>&gt;<i>                       logged in to the system AND the region also needs to
</I>&gt;<i>know that the agent
</I>&gt;<i>                       that is representing this user is a legitimate agent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       OK, so the part about being logged in is easy; the
</I>&gt;<i>user server already
</I>&gt;<i>                       knows that, to some approximation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       However, the part about the agent being legitimate is
</I>&gt;<i>a bit more tricky.
</I>&gt;<i>                       Here's the bad thing that can happen: Charles logs in
</I>&gt;<i>to OSgrid, and TPs
</I>&gt;<i>                       to this intriguing region called &quot;Sports Illuminated
</I>&gt;<i>Swimming Suite
</I>&gt;<i>                       Edition&quot;. That region happens to be up to no good. It
</I>&gt;<i>grabs Charles
</I>&gt;<i>                       current notion of identity (all the current
</I>&gt;<i>identifiers we use), it
</I>&gt;<i>                       crashes Charles' viewer so that the user server never
</I>&gt;<i>knows about it,
</I>&gt;<i>                       and proceeds to impersonate Charles using all those
</I>&gt;<i>stolen identifiers;
</I>&gt;<i>                       for example, it can go back to Charles's regions and
</I>&gt;<i>erase them
</I>&gt;<i>                       completely pretending to be Charles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       So, what can we do to detect the legitimacy of agents?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       Having scratched my head over this, I came to the
</I>&gt;<i>conclusion that the
</I>&gt;<i>                       most promising element that can be used to identify
</I>&gt;<i>agents is the
</I>&gt;<i>                       Viewer's EndPoint. This is what happens down in the
</I>&gt;<i>LLUDPServer (I'm
</I>&gt;<i>                       sure something similar happens in other viewers'
</I>&gt;<i>packet handlers):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                                  if (packet != null)
</I>&gt;<i>                                  {
</I>&gt;<i>                                      if (packet.Type ==
</I>&gt;<i>PacketType.UseCircuitCode)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>AddNewClient((UseCircuitCodePacket)packet, epSender,
</I>&gt;<i>                       epProxy);
</I>&gt;<i>                                      else
</I>&gt;<i>                                          ProcessInPacket(packet, epSender);
</I>&gt;<i>                                  }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       The EndPoint epSender comes directly from the socket
</I>&gt;<i>and I'm assuming it
</I>&gt;<i>                       can't be faked, at least the IP part. Is this correct?
</I>&gt;<i>This is a
</I>&gt;<i>                       critical assumption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       So, back to the &quot;Sports Illuminated&quot; scenario: that
</I>&gt;<i>sim would then try
</I>&gt;<i>                       to launch an agent at Charles' region. It can fake
</I>&gt;<i>everything except
</I>&gt;<i>                       being Charles' viewer machine. When Charles' region
</I>&gt;<i>does that code
</I>&gt;<i>                       above, it asks the User server for authentication of
</I>&gt;<i>an agent with all
</I>&gt;<i>                       those identifiers and the given EndPoint, and the User
</I>&gt;<i>server tells back
</I>&gt;<i>                       that Charles wasn't using that EndPoint to start with,
</I>&gt;<i>so the
</I>&gt;<i>                       authentication fails, and an alarm is rang.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>                       Disclaimer: I'm not an expert in security, I'm just
</I>&gt;<i>using my brain in
</I>&gt;<i>                       context.
