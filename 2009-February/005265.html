<PRE>Yeah, this is something wrong with the SL viewer. OpenSim won't ever touch those settings, nor should it be possible to trigger the viewer to delete those settings, even by accident. My guess would be a viewer bug of some description.

I don't think Opensim would have had how to have done this. Maybe it was some error in the SL client or something else that deleted it. Did you uninstall a Release Candidate or First Look viewer as well? In the past I had issues where uninstalling RC or FirstLook also removed my SL settings.

Subject: [Opensim-dev] SL settings folder has been deleted

Trying unsuccessfully a freshly compiled version of OpenSim for a few days, I decided to try the binaries version.  I installed it as indicated, as standalone.  It worked well, but....  it deleted completely my Application data Second Life folder content.  My settings plus a few years of logs I had there, keeping mainly logs of my scripters groups in SL.  Plus discussions I had with people I hire... plus.. plus...
Gee... how can this be?  Did it ever happen to anybody else?
