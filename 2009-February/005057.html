<PRE>Hello Mike,

Thank you for your professional reply. I have tried to reach you in irc
immediately after you first commented the mantis but we seem to be in
different time zones.

The NHibernate unit tests are not in the build as the system is still in
experimental state. We have not tried to push them into build yet to avoid
hindering the OpenSim development before there is clear indication that
NHibernate storage is complete and mature enough to be used in production
systems. Currently we are intentionally playing catchup with rest of the
systems.

I was talking with mikkopa and he suggested we should create two tables to
cover AssetBase to solve this issue properly. Namely AssetMetadata for
metadata information and AssetData for blobs to avoid situation where we end
up accessing also the blob data just to read metadata.  He thought you had
something like this in mind when you moved metadata fields to aggregate
object. This approach would also fix the double id issue which is caused by
the fact that nhibernate to my best knowledge does not support reading
object primary id from aggregate object.

I apologize if I overreacted. It is hard for me to read people and
intentions in online environments.

regards,
Tommi
