<PRE>I see an issue there.

Currently we use simple events. AN event calls all it's handlers in 
no particular order, and if the handler is defined as having a 
return value, the value returned from the event invocation is the 
return value of the last handler, whichever that happened to be.
There are no guarantees as to which handler runs first, although I 
know that both current implementations call the handler in the order 
they were registered. This behavior can not be depended upon.

So, to make this work with return values, it would require a huge 
code mess (like Scene.Permissions), with a boatload of code written 
for each event, or, if it's done through generics or dictionaries, a 
severe performance hit.

Therefore, despite my prior +1 to the concept as such, it's not 
doable in that way. There has to be a way, there always is. It just 
needs to be found.

I think it could be done by creating a new class, ModuleEvent&lt;T&gt;. T 
would be the delegate type, so you would instantiate the class in 
EventManager like so:

public delegate bool DoSomethingDelegate(whatever parms);

public static ModuleEvent&lt;DoSomethingDelegate&gt; DoSomething;

and used like so:

DoSomething.AddHandler(T);
DoSomething.RemoveHandler(T);

DoSomething.Handler(whatever parms);

where Handler is public T Handler {get;}

Would that be feasible?

The point is to reduce implementing a new event to adding 2 lines, 
rather than 20.

This intrigues me, I'm going to try that :)

</I>&gt;<i> With these two things, an xmpp bridge module could be loaded before the 'ordinary' im module.  If it gets an incoming im

</I>&gt;<i>   If it can't handle it then it simply returns false and the message goes through to the next module on the list (in

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I like this solution because I think that it allows composibility - you can load lots of different
