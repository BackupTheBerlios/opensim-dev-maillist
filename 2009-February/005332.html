<PRE>Hi there,

Tokens is definitely the right technique to choose.

It does not adresse trust concerns against the token-provider (i.g. the
gridserver operator) and does not implement a fully trusted &amp; secure stack.

But it&#146;s a major step towards the goal and a decision to choose the right
and most actual weapon.

The OpenidTokenExchange seems to be promising.  Project Geneva SDK from
Microsoft may be an alternative, as well (providing opened and SAML).
However, being compatible with other systems would be great, but a opened
basis should be fine.

Dirk is right - usually  (got some presentation here if someone wants to get
that emailed). The access resource doesn not know about the Username etc.

This technique is what is used in professional access management for a
while, i.e. Novell, Microsoft use this.

Kebereos was a early implementation of this idea, and searching for a
standard most companys did choose LDAP as the user database.  Tokens are
time limited.

However - in newer days, the idea is used in extend to right management
system and will be compatible with this idea.
A single attribute of in identity is handled as a claim.

To give an example about usage of tokens and claims:

You are logged in into osgrid.
You want to visit a place, that is adult rated.
You did approve to be an adult, what is a attribute of your identity.

You hypergrid to that place, maybe an adult shop.

You need to be identified (what Diva did outline).
So you send the target system your token.

The token is verified at the osgrid server.

The target systems asks the osgridserver for your adult check.

The osgrid server asks you for permission on that claim

You accept, and the target has 
a) identified you
b) does now, that you are an adult - but does not even know your real name


--&gt; This is a maybe future story, but it would be possible via a decision
for token and later for claims.


For now, the pure identification could be implemented and the token-flow is
puerely between server in 2 roles:
- identification server, handling tokens
- resource server (as a hypergrid target system) using token to identify
user

The user still uses purely Username/Passwort from Client to identification
server.


We have a perfect model that this works in Microsoft Windows:

Windows NT was username/password based
Windows 2000 introduced stuff from *nix like LDAP and Kerberos (and
BIND-comp. DNS, and other stuff)

So for a migration phase , the clients did still use the old style
(NT-logon) while modern server did use the token mechanism.

Today, token are used in all directions - wich enables Microsoft to Offer
Claimbased access (Windows Cardspace) and simple right management
integration.



Cheers,
Ralf

I recently talked to mrtopf/tao takashi about getting openid into opensim
because I was/am hoping to sink a couple of developer days into implementing
this.

from what I understood one the tricky parts is to implement openid in the
client, since from an openid standpoint you dont want the server to receive
username and password at all. after the negotiation between the client and
the openid provider there is some additional token sent to the server to
double check that this negotiation really happened.

</I>
yep and a token is also what the original / current rexserver uses for 
the 'global avatar system' uses to address this issue. there the client 
can connect to any world, tell who it is, pass a one-time(?) token 
gotten from auth a second ago, which the world then uses to verify from 
the auth the user uses (and the server has decided to trust).

the plan is probably to switch to openid and that in Rex as well, i.e. 
to 'standards instead of Finnish magic' (in J. Hurlman's words from the 
other day :) . we did the mistake back then 1,5 years ago when worked on 
rexauth that, when thought too much of avatars and other VW specific 
stuff also, even though did realize that one part is only about 
identity, failed to realize that openid would have helped (maybe the 
token exchange wasn't there yet even, iirc it's more recent than oauth?) 
.. also because the ppl who got the idea didn't know about openid i 
guess (i didn't know much either so failed to make the connection).

the other mistake i guess was that didn't consider how it could work 
with the existing user server in opensim, i guess because we thought 
that's somehow tied to the grid-bound auth used in SL and Opensim 
otherwise (which Rex got rid of and instead has the independent auth 
that can work for any grid or server, like openid).

at least the guys did get it implemented quickly and afaik it has been 
working ok since and kinda proves that model partly at least?

and now it seems we have a chance to get it with standards and properly. 
yay!
