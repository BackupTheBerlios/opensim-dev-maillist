<PRE>There's a fine line to draw here, and if we go too far the immersion 
feeling will be affected. So the difficult thing in this approach will 
be to draw that line. It would be an interesting academic exercise to 
pull out ALL the features from the viewer except its 3D rendering 
engine-ness.

I started writing down an attempt at categorizing this, but I realized 
that we will never get consensus on the feeling of immersion. Our best 
option, on the OpenSim side, is to make it configurable at the services 
level and to leave it to the world builders to choose which features 
they want to serve via the 3D rendering engine viewer. The tradeoff 
being, the more features they allow the LL viewer to do, the less safely 
interoperable things will be because the LL viewer proxies things 
through the regions, therefore assuming the regions are to be trusted. 
In cases of worlds that don't want interoperability of any kind, or 
worlds that simply want the &quot;trust domains&quot; a-la Linden Lab, that is 
fine. For everything else (Hypergrid), regions are not to be trusted in 
general, and those extra 2D interfaces can be used instead.

The good thing is that if we do that separation, it shouldn't be hard 
for the Hippo devs, for example, to chop down the monolithic application 
and start integrating other more secure components.

In any case, here's a slightly more extended list of features to think 
about:

- Inventory
- Social network (groups, friends, etc)
- Admin tasks (estate/region/parcel permissions, bans, etc)
- Search
- IM
- Map
- Teleports
- Script editing
- Inter-user inworld interaction (inventory exchanges)
- ...
