SDague has a good point. And it gets a bit more interesting when one considers the OSSearch module, which did become non-functional a few days ago and folks have been scrambling and struggling to get their regions back in operation.

It could be argued that bringing that active module, which is one small C# file into SVN might be to our advantage for the same reasons we are discussing here.

I'm personally all for moving thinks to an Optional space, but we have
to be honest with ourselves, moving a module to the forge means that
there is a better than 50% chance it's unusable in 2 weeks time.  I
think for things we've considered &quot;dead&quot; that's fine, but I'd be
reluctant to push bits out that people do regularly use (like the irc
bridge).  At least until we have:

1. an easy way to build an out of core module build tree
2. network repository support for modules (ala what's in mono addins)
3. some type of versioning on module interfaces, so we can know if a
plugin thinks it can work with the current build

Otherwise we are more or less jetisoning a lot of features and reducing
the number of users that we can serve out of the box.  The same logic
that would leave these modules in the tree is the same logic that keeps
all the extra stuff in bin/, to make it easy for the new user to get
started.

This shouldn't stop this current level of reorganization, which I think
is very useful.  But is just a warning on next steps of removing things
from the tree.
