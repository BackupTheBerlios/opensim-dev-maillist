As far as I know GPL viral clause doesn't apply if you just use the API, or
don't link the code statically.

Notice that I'm not wedded to Tahoe. It's just this is the only system with
the required capabilities I'm aware of.

The Tahoe secure filesystem

By Jake Edge

April 30, 2008

The Tahoe filesystem is designed as a secure, distributed filesystem that is
available as free software. Tahoe is also designed for fault tolerance so
that data remains available even in the presence of missing or malicious
peers. In March, the project released a 1.0 version which makes this a good
time to take a peek.

The basics of Tahoe are somewhat similar to GNUnet or Freenet in that the
data is encrypted and spread around to multiple nodes in the network. Unlike
those, though, Tahoe does not seek to provide anonymity. The nodes making up
a Tahoe filesystem are called a &quot;grid&quot;. Grids consist of some number of peers
acting as storage server nodes along with an &quot;introducer&quot; that knows all of
the other nodes and is the central point of contact for the grid.

Files are stored in Tahoe by first being encrypted on the local machine using
AES. They are then broken into &quot;shares&quot;, ten by default, that are distributed
to different servers in the grid. Before that happens, though, the encrypted
file is encoded in such a way that the whole file can be recovered even if
only a subset of the shares can be retrieved.

This encoding, known as &quot;erasure coding&quot;, is the key to the fault-tolerance
of the Tahoe system. By default, Tahoe encodes the shares such that
retrieving three of the ten is sufficient to recover the entire file. It also
increases the size of the file by the expected 10/3 ratio.

The suggested use case for Tahoe is a &quot;friendnet&quot; where some group of friends
share their storage with each other in a way that reduces or eliminates the
need for backups. Tahoe also has ways to share data in either read-only or
read-write (immutable or mutable in Tahoe-speak) modes. Tahoe is used as a
commercial backup system by Allmydata, sponsor of the Tahoe project.

Tahoe is designed to be secure, which means that it protects the integrity
and confidentiality of the data stored in it. SHA-256 is used extensively to
ensure consistency of the plaintext, ciphertext, and shares. Files stored in
the system are identified by long identifiers called capabilities, that look
something like:

URI:CHK:yeyur23dw7cg3mxmsl2kiqvtt4:sdtrgczwtntzyfg2uapbfytxvyqsn45j4jpgrhcey7ebzpaoznya:3:10:107833344

For mutable files, there are two versions of the capability, one that allows
only reading, while the other allows writing as well. Anyone who does not
have a capability string for a particular file cannot access it at all.

Multiple user interfaces are available for Tahoe, including a web interface,
a command-line interface, a FUSE extension and a web API. Tahoe is written in
Python, using some C extensions for efficiency. It uses the Twisted framework
for event handling, pycryptopp (a Python interface to the Crypto++ library)
for its encryption needs, and zfec for the erasure coding. All of the Tahoe
code is available under the GPL.

Installing Tahoe was fairly straightforward&#8212;there were a few hiccups which
have since been resolved&#8212;using the installation guide. Joining the test grid
was as easy as putting an introducer identifier into a file and starting
Tahoe from the command line. In some basic testing, it seems to work quite
well, overall, though it did not seem to use available bandwidth as
efficiently as it might.

This brief overview only scratches the surface of the information available
about Tahoe; there is much more on the documentation page. For anyone
interested in distributed, secure, and/or fault-tolerant filesystems, Tahoe
is definitely worth a look.
