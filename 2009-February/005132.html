<PRE>I thought it prudent to point out that the following statement is 100% fiction;

&quot; 2. We have a significant number of assets of each and every edit of
terrain, where only the very last one is accessible&quot;

What I think you meant to say was,

&quot;2. Every two days each region generates a new map tile image and
names it terrainImage.  These do eventually add up&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; created with a default constructor. And I suspect are never accessible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In fact, this field has always seemed redundant to me since the user only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ever manipulates assets by their inventory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> name, which is entirely separate from the asset name. The asset name is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> never visible to the user (and afaik is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used anywhere else in the code).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At one point I thought about proposing to remove it. Possibly this issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be revisited.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe it's kept there just as a convenience - to be able to get some
</I>&gt;<i> kind of semantics, not necessarily exact, when browsing the table.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 2. We have a significant number of assets of each and every edit of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; terrain, where only the very last one is accessible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, this does seem wasteful to me since old terrain assets are not used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by anything, afaik.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have proposed a number of times that we could have a virtual asset_key as
</I>&gt;<i> well as an asset_id - so that things that would rewrite assets could use the
</I>&gt;<i> asset_key as an aux method to actually try to overwrite the asset. In the
</I>&gt;<i> terrain case, the asset would be overwritten by key, not by id. This would
</I>&gt;<i> allow us to implement a number of parallell schemas where some assets would
</I>&gt;<i> be overwritten (asset_key = asset_id) and some where we would keep a history
</I>&gt;<i> (only asset_key) and some where doing either or would be configurable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 3. We have a significant number of assets of each and every text edit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for each and every textual assets. Where only the last one should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; accessible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately, this is not the case. For instance, imagine that you create
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a script in your inventory. You drag this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script into a region object. At this point, both the entry in your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inventory and the entry in the region point to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same textual asset.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But then you edit the script in your inventory. After the edit it points
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to a new asset containing the edited text.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, the region object is still pointing to the old script asset. So
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we need to keep both the old and new textual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not to mention the fact that the viewer caches stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, you're right in that textual assets which are never used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> elsewhere (i.e. are intermediate edits that never get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dragged into an object, given to someone else, or otherwise transmitted)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might possibly be eliminated with some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sufficiently careful scheme.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Binary de-duplication and added semantics in the form of 'key' or 'class'
</I>&gt;<i> would probably go a long way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Its a bit like collecting every scrap of paper ever written with either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; text or binary glyphs and putting them in a big filing cabinet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; After a while, finding the ones that are &quot;interesting&quot; in a &quot;timely&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; manner starts to get a little &quot;challenging&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's keep the shining torch of this discussion burning.
