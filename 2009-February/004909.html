I hear you - I'm also personally starting to favour a solution that doesn't require an initial module keyword (though 
then ideally one has to try and catch clashes between modules which try and register the same command).

I also know what you mean about the inconsistency - I do hope that will clear up eventually (at least within core), but 
it's actually quite a chore to correct because of the various ad hoc parsing of commands that goes on.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing...  if the command is not recognized or has parameter 
</I>&gt;<i> issues, just now it just comes back to the prompt.  A little 
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledgement that the command is not recognized would be nice.
</I>
I agree.  Unfortunately, there is again quite a bit of messiness in the code that prevent this being easily done right now.
