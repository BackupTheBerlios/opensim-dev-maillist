The spoofer can't receive the packet sent from the server, and that's 
the main point. But it can send a reply packet anyways. It can send it 
blindly, trying to guess what the number might be. It could send 128 of 
them, each with a different number.

Yes. It's just that walled-gardens tend to be more private, so for example you may not know the IP address of the region as easily as in open systems; and it will be much harder to find the user's identifiers. Security through obscurity -- which is always a fragile situation, but at least it's a cloth that open systems don't have.
