<PRE>Hi there,


At least usecases will be pretty important to show how to use opensim for
other stuff than gaming, while gaming and using it for a creative and
relaxing time are own usecases.

Some of them will develop to business cases.


To show, that opensim is mature enough and how to develop a solution to a
demand, based on opensim as a technology we started with a first Usecase on
<A HREF="http://www.rexdeveloper.org/wiki/index.php?title=UC-classroom-tactical-train">http://www.rexdeveloper.org/wiki/index.php?title=UC-classroom-tactical-train</A>
ing .

I expect to get 1 per 3 month period.

All this (from my side) will only be things, where real life companys are
interested to use this - and maybe even fund the needed development.

At least the usecases should deliver knowledge back to the community, and
where the commercial arrangement with the &quot;customer&quot; does allow - code
should be opend, as well.

I will have my first project meeting at the 6th of march and I am very happy
about the possibility to show opensim to an organization that is not just
100 people in size.


Cheers,
Ralf

You are going to have fun with this one. There's probably at least a hundred
separate ones, depending on who you ask.

OpenSim has a lot of commercial contributions, a lot of which are biased
towards particular features that their implementations need. Our goal has
been to create a platform flexible enough that we can accommodate all these
together while still sharing enough 'common ground'.

Subject: [Opensim-dev] The Business Case for OpenSim

Hi,

I have been thinking about writing a Business Case for OpenSim. A Business
Case is the feasibility study performed before a full Business Plan is
written, and is equally applicable to opensource 'products'.

If such a Case has not been written before, then I would be prepared to
write one, if the core developers would like one. But beware, it could be
quite tough.

As for credentials, I used to write business cases and business plans for
News Corporation.

Let me know,

Rock

Dear colleagues;

 

for some time now, we at Tribal Media have employed an entirely different
way of logging the viewer in, with tokens, that does not constitute changing
the viewer.

 

What we do, is that we install a 'launcher' app on the users computer. It
serves a number of purposes:

 

1) Installs rezzme, genesis and osurl url monikers, all of them taking
tokens as auxiliary data - these monikers let people log onto web sites, and
launch a viewer with a pre-authenticated token by a link. (see step 5)

 

2) Identifies installed viewers, and keep track of preferreed viewer.

 

3) Provides a pre-login login form to do non-web pre-launch authentication
(in this case, this would probably be where the _form_ obtains the token to
pass to step 5)

 

4) Launches pre-requisite software, as the TribalVoice.exe for when voice
should be enabled, or a Proxy to divert certain packets.

 

5) Launched preferred user, with seamless login (using the login option of
the ll viewer with dummy data to bypass the login screen) supplying the
TOKEN in a tweaked LOGINURI - an example of this loginuri would be -loginuri
<A HREF="http://{loginserver">http://{loginserver</A>}/?token={token} - have a look at the login service, it
has been providing overloads and aux data for some time now, just to be able
to do this.

 

6) Provides for hypergrid cross-login by providing both loginuri and target
region as endpoint.


While we might not want to provide all these options in OpenSim, I think our
approach has worked well for us and our clients.


Most of the code for these options are actually already out there in various
scattered projects.


Best regards,
Stefan Andersson

Subject: Re: [Opensim-dev] User Authentication

Right. The constraint here, let's not forget, is that we want to continue to
reuse the LL viewer for a while.
I'm going to read that doc about OpenID tokens, but if it requires
participation from the viewer, forget it... We are and will continue to be
in LL Viewer hacking mode in the foreseeable future, abnd I want to make
things safe before a better viewer comes along.

The bottom line question in my email, phrased in OpenID terminology, is
whether we can use the Viewer's IP address as the token.

As we cannot change the viewer at the moment one could use the opensim login

We have never made an incompatible change to the script states 
format. I fully intend to not break it.That said, it doesn't belong 
in a database, IMO. Database storage makes it so much harder to 
autoclean and maintain them.
Script crossing is already implemented and has been for a while. 
They get transferred properly in that case.

Personally, I think they're fine just where they are.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
