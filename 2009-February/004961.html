<PRE>All assets have, at some point, been on a user's inventory. There is 
no way to upload anything without having it in inventory at some point.
The largest assets are textures, and they will always pass through 
user inventories. Also, they will remain in user inventories despite 
_also_ being on region objects. Making regions hold their own assets 
authoritatively would cause massive data duplication, albeit 
distributed, and not really unclutter the central database.

I believe a tag and reap mechanism that slow-scans all assets for 
contained assets and all inventories for referencs and tags all 
referenced assets, as well as regions transmitting &quot;asset lists&quot; of 
assets currently referenced inworld, and the last use flag. Let that 
run for 6 months, then reap all unflagged, reset all flags, and 
start a new cycle.

This doesn't have to be mutually exclusive, in fact it can be 
combined with persistent local asset caching (e.g. local texture 
storage for inworld objects) as well as a HG model.
