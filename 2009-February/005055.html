First, let me apologize for any disrespect you feel, it's definitely
unintentional.

Second, I need to apologize for ignoring the NHibernate unit tests. My
testing script runs whatever is in .nant/local.include and
.nant/bamboo.build, and it appears OpenSim.Data.NHibernate.Tests.dll
is listed in neither of those. Once the NHibernate tests pass, they
should probably be included. Of course this is no excuse for not
looking for the NHibernate tests sooner.

Finally, you may notice in the commit message that the patch came from
another contributor attached to
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=3080">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=3080</A> who was having issues
with NHibernate on startup. I believe this qualifies as a problem in
production. The patch fixed that issue. Naturally, had I run the tests
like I should have, I would have noticed they fail, and left a comment
for the author of the patch accordingly.

Please don't regard this as a personal attack. In fact, the commit of
the patch was mainly in response to
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=3080">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=3080</A> rather than imposing
my fix to <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=3122.">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=3122.</A>

Thanks,
Mike
