<PRE>I have trouble understanding these remarks by Melanie and Adam, so am 
hoping to get some clarification:

On Feb 20, 2009, at 3:02 PM, Melanie wrote:
&gt;<i> It serves a purpose, handles a use case, that gives little benefit
</I>&gt;<i> to OpenSim.
</I>
i thought the reasoning goes also the other way around:
&quot;if someone has a use case where they'd benefit from using Tahoe with 
OpenSim, they are free to do it&quot;

if it doesn't give much benefit for OpenSim otherwise, that doesn't 
matter, as long as people who want to use it can, without hurting 
OpenSim (by requiring a lot of / strange, otherwise unbeneficial 
changes in the core).

&gt;<i> The point is not to provide raw storage. The point would be that
</I>&gt;<i> every user provides storage for _what they use_.
</I>&gt;<i> If OSGrid were to use tahoe for assets, and run a forced update,
</I>&gt;<i> more than half the grid would be down for days!
</I>&gt;<i> With Tahoe, no one would have any assets in that time, because too
</I>&gt;<i> many nodes would be missing.
</I>
Ok well so be it for OSGrid.

But perhaps some other user, maybe e.g. some intranet somewhere, has it 
differently.

&gt;<i> And, we just prefer BSD.....
</I>
Feel free, but there is a wealth of good software as GPL, and I sure 
hope to be able to use those too. Like I'm happy to use Linux to run 
our company servers, and it being GPL is just fine for me. But I'm also 
happy that Ogre is BSD so we are free to license our games however we 
need.

So am curious of this remark Adam made:

My understanding is that licenses are about distribution, and are not 
about usage.

So if e.g. a company has an internal Tahoe datastore, and they'd like 
to use OpenSim to e.g. run their business using some sort of virtual 
office application (yes we've thought sometimes that should make a game 
of running the company 'cause the guys seem to be more enthusiastic to 
play games than run business often..), and there exists some sort of 
storage module for OpenSim that allows that .. can't the company just 
install those and use them, no matter that some of the parts are BSD 
and some GPL?

They would not be able to make a closed source product that bundles 
OpenSim and Tahoe, 'cause are using Tahoe under GPL, but they are not 
distributing .. just using.

I'm sorry, am not a lawyer so perhaps should not be posting about these 
at all. I guess what Adam meant by 'Client libraries and things are 
usually needed' is that the OpenSim can't integrate GPL libs for Tahoe 
usage .. but can a 3rd party plugin for using them together still 
exist? I'm sure it can it an at least internally if I don't tell 
anyone! :p

I sure hope this doesn't explose to a huge license discussion, please 
just point to a better place or reply in private if that would happen.
