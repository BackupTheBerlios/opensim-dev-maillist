<PRE>You are going to have fun with this one. There's probably at least a hundred separate ones, depending on who you ask.

OpenSim has a lot of commercial contributions, a lot of which are biased towards particular features that their implementations need. Our goal has been to create a platform flexible enough that we can accommodate all these together while still sharing enough 'common ground'.

Subject: [Opensim-dev] The Business Case for OpenSim

Hi,

I have been thinking about writing a Business Case for OpenSim. A Business Case is the feasibility study performed before a full Business Plan is written, and is equally applicable to opensource 'products'.

If such a Case has not been written before, then I would be prepared to write one, if the core developers would like one. But beware, it could be quite tough.

As for credentials, I used to write business cases and business plans for News Corporation.

Let me know,

Rock
