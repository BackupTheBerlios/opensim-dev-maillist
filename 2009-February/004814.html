<PRE>Just a bit of a day dream here, but for the sake of preventing users 
from becoming stranded on foreign grids / sims I wonder if it would be a 
good idea to make non-hypergrid sims accept and hold a hypergrid user's 
profile cache.  That way as a user explores and pops around on a foreign 
grid / sim their home grid and other data would still follow them.  
Non-hypergrid sims would simply hold and pass this data on to the next 
teleport while doing nothing else with it.  For example this is sort of 
the data flow I'm thinking of:

1 - Orion logs into Pseudospace at Ellis Island then teleports over to 
the UCI Gateway on OSgrid
    * - Ellis Island on Pseudospace passes his HG profile over to UCI 
Gateway via HG allowing him to return home and access inventory
2 - Orion pops over from UCI Gateway over to Wright Plaza (non-HG).
    * - UCI Gateway sends Orion's normal and HG profile over to Wright 
Plaza  using normal TP - WP simply holds both profiles and does nothing 
with them - no access to home servers.
3 - Orion then pops over from WP to Bade Plaza (non-HG)
    * - Wp sends Orion's HG and normal profile to Bade using normal TP, 
Bade holds onto it but does nothing with it - still no access to home 
servers.
4 - Orion realizes he left his oven on at his loft back on Ravenport 
(Pseudospace) then decides to go home.  Teleports from Bade back to UCI 
Gateway.
    * - Bade sends Orion's HG and normal profile back to UCI  using 
normal TP, UCI recognizes him as an HG user and allows him inventory and 
tp home access.
5 - Orion poofs from UCI Gateway back to Ellis Island (Pseudospace's HG 
gateway)
    * - UCI Gateway sends Orion's HG and normal profile back to Ellis 
using HG - Ellis picks him up as a home user then continues normal 
operation.
6 - Orion pops over to Ravenport (non-HG) from Ellis to turn his oven 
off before his loft burns down.
    * - Ellis sends Orion and his profiles over using the normal 
teleport mechanism - HG profile is stored but ignored.

Thanks, :)

</I>&gt;<i> Here's what happens. Foreign users carry around information about their 
</I>&gt;<i> servers (user, inventory, home region, etc) that is stored on their 
</I>&gt;<i> run-time profile cached in the regions. When they go from an HG region 
</I>&gt;<i> to another HG region, that information is passed on via the message 
</I>&gt;<i> expect_hg_user, which only HG regions understand. When they go from an 
</I>&gt;<i> HG region to a non-HG region, the receiving region doesn't understand 
</I>&gt;<i> that message, so it knows nothing about those servers for the foreign 
</I>&gt;<i> user. If the TP is far enough away, the profile is removed from the 
</I>&gt;<i> departing HG region (as normal for all TPs), so the user's servers info 
</I>&gt;<i> is permanently lost for the rest of the session. Even if the user comes 
</I>&gt;<i> back to the HG region, the information has been lost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Without that information the foreign user cannot: access inventory 
</I>&gt;<i> (except for the items that are cached in the viewer), go back home, etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So jumping from an HG region to a non-HG region on the same grid is ok, 
</I>&gt;<i> in the sense that it doesn't crash anything, and that the user's agent 
</I>&gt;<i> is is able to interact with the world, but that user becomes impaired in 
</I>&gt;<i> many ways. The user is still able to chat, build &amp; move things (if 
</I>&gt;<i> allowed), TP around, etc. It's just the interaction with his/her home 
</I>&gt;<i> servers that is impaired.
