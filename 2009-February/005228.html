<PRE>That won't wash.

If i give copy perm just because i need it to be no trans, that 
doesn't mean that I condone off-grid use or personal backup. It has 
to be separated from the &quot;perms&quot; as we know them.

Most clothing is no mod/no trans. That doesn't mean that the 
clothing creator would want me to be able to download their stuff, 
meaning I would get the raw textures on my disk, to modify and 
reupload as mine...

That that is easy to do with copybot or by getting it from the 
viewer cache is beside the point here, the amount of criminal energy 
required for content theft would be significantly reduced.
