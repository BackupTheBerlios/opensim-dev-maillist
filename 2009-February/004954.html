<PRE>Dear Mike:

What you say seems reasonable and I applaud you.

On the related subject of mutability, I have a tough time imagining that each edit of the terrain of a region is useful. I would suggest that only the last &quot;terrainImage&quot; is useful and cannot imagine any reference to any obsolete terrainImage by any object anywhere.

There are a significant number of items in OpenSim mysql databases such as the various edits of a script where we appear to be storing a new UUID for each edit. In a similar manner, I would think that such obsolete edits are not useful.

So, half of the problem is a strategy to slow down the bloat of our assetServers with perhaps additional references to additional assetServers and half is to perhaps re-consider all the orphaned items we are leaving in our mysql database and find a way to stop doing that.

Charles

This ever-expanding asset database is a consequence of how assets are
handled by SL, the SL viewer and, since OpenSim was first developed
against the SL viewer, by OpenSim as well. The premise is that no asset
is mutable, because any asset may be referenced by its UUID. The
reference may exist in a script or on the back of a napkin. There are
more details (the way I understand them) in a previous email[1] I sent
to the list.

Cable Beach will not solve this problem.

&gt;<i> Now, to the beginnings of a suggestion. It seems to me that each
</I>&gt;<i> avatar will have a &quot;home&quot; region. And that perhaps that is the place
</I>&gt;<i> to store the items in an avatars inventory. Things like scripts,
</I>&gt;<i> notecards, textures and the like. 
</I>
I'm not sure this is the right way forward. It requires that the user's
home region is up anytime they wish to use their avatar and access
their inventory. The user's home region becomes a single point of
failure.

&gt;<i> At that point, the assetServer on a grid could be used to store only
</I>&gt;<i> pointers (or URL's) to each avatars inventory on his or her home
</I>&gt;<i> region.
</I>
This is a good start, except instead of pointing to the user's home
region, it could point to the user's own asset server. The asset server
could be provided by a grid (OSGrid), their own asset server (a Cable
Beach instance, perhaps), or some other third party that may provide
asset storage/access in the future (SL, Yahoo!, Google, AOL, etc).

Thanks,
Mike
