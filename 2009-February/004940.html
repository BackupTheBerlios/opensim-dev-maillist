<PRE>We have been studying the assets table on OSGrid as it heads toward the &quot;disk full&quot; stage and I have a couple of observations and am heading towards a suggestion. Maybe this is already accounted for in the &quot;Cable Beach&quot; project, at which point, this will only indicate that I did not read all the exchanges carefully enough.

It appears to me that we are storing on the MySQL data store at the assetServer on a grid every edit of every script, terrainImage and clothingItem amongst other things. So, my first observation is that we appear to be storing all the older, obsolete items that can no longer be accessed.

Additionally, it appears to me that we are also storing things that could arguably be stored on the regions datastore, such as the terrainImage.

Now, to the beginnings of a suggestion. It seems to me that each avatar will have a &quot;home&quot; region. And that perhaps that is the place to store the items in an avatars inventory. Things like scripts, notecards, textures and the like. 

At that point, the assetServer on a grid could be used to store only pointers (or URL's) to each avatars inventory on his or her home region.

So, by doing that, we start shifting the ever increasing disk storage requirements of a grid back to the regions distributed around the internet.

Again, perhaps Cable Beach is already doing this, and if so, this is great. If not, I put out these ideas and duck as the tomatoes start flying.
