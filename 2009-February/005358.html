<PRE>I indeed didn't know that, thanks a bunch for pointing it out. Like Mark
I also would be interested on how this was achieved?

PS: Since it seems that the whole proposed OpenID strategy will only
work for Charles, I better order a t-shirt with 'I AM CHARLES KRINKE'
printed on it.

With all grids being independent of one another, or in the example given
by John, maybe use an &quot;openid.osgrid.org/users/screenname&quot;

For those of you who don't know, this already exists. Click this:

Again, in this example Charles happens to have his identity at OSGrid,
but that's not a requirement of the exchange. It could just as easily
been an identity from another grid.

 

This way various grids could all run &quot;openID&quot; servers, and trust
agreements would need to be established between the various grids.

I'm not going to act on anything that suggests &quot;trust agreements between
various grids.&quot; That's an AWG concept that I very much disagree with,
and want no part in. I have no problem with companies cutting corners on
security in order to be able to exchange agents on a lawyer-backed up
trust basis. But that's not what I'm doing here, and that's not what a
lot of people want OpenSim to be.

The goal is to be able to go from my home standalone to *any* sim out
there that I know nothing about, and still be sure that nothing bad will
happen to my belongings. Anything less than this is not acceptable as a
goal, for me.
