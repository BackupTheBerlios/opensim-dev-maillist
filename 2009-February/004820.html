</I>&gt;<i> Opensim has been a hobby activity for me, and I suspect that's true for 
</I>&gt;<i> many of the developers, testers, and users as well. I like to see 
</I>&gt;<i> properly functioning software which is one of the reasons I began 
</I>&gt;<i> contributing. I also wanted use of some features that didn't yet exist 
</I>&gt;<i> in the software so I took it upon myself to implement them and also 
</I>&gt;<i> share them with the rest of the community. Since then I continue to make 
</I>&gt;<i> time to contribute, in the form of bug fixes, enhancements, or new 
</I>&gt;<i> features. This takes time away from the time I have to actually use the 
</I>&gt;<i> software as I intended in the first place. I don't mind sharing some of 
</I>&gt;<i> my time and effort in support of community goals as in the case of a 
</I>&gt;<i> community project such as Opensim I generally get more benefit out than 
</I>&gt;<i> I put in. I suspect that many users and testers feel the same way and 
</I>&gt;<i> they may often have passionate feelings about their contributions which 
</I>&gt;<i> can sometimes result in conflict. Perhaps some conflict can be a healthy 
</I>&gt;<i> thing but I'm just not sure in the case which inspired this thread. 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I do review mantis issues frequently and I tend to address 
</I>&gt;<i> some when I have a reasonable understanding of the affected portions of 
</I>&gt;<i> the code base, when there is sufficient information available in the 
</I>&gt;<i> Mantis entries, when I have the resources to easily replicate the 
</I>&gt;<i> problem, and when I have sufficient time available to attempt and test a 
</I>&gt;<i> fix. Once I've successfully implemented a fix then I submit it and 
</I>&gt;<i> either mark the issue as resolved or add a note asking for others to 
</I>&gt;<i> help test. I seldom close an entry and usually leave it for the 
</I>&gt;<i> submitter to close.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think most of the information that is submitted on Mantis has 
</I>&gt;<i> potential value and I'm not sure that limiting access will be 
</I>&gt;<i> beneficial. I would rather propose that simple guidelines be developed 
</I>&gt;<i> which describe helpful and effective reports, and these guidelines be 
</I>&gt;<i> displayed in a prominent manner during the submission process. I also 
</I>&gt;<i> would like to suggest that many of the developers are in a similar 
</I>&gt;<i> situation as myself; this is a low level and uncompensated activity for 
</I>&gt;<i> them and they simply don't have the resources to address all mantis 
</I>&gt;<i> entries. This should not mean that some issues are more important than 
</I>&gt;<i> others or that some are being purposely ignored. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With regards to state: The current ones are usable but there is some 
</I>&gt;<i> confusion on my part about the best way to use them. I would like to see 
</I>&gt;<i> a state along the lines of &quot;solution implemented, awaiting feedback from 
</I>&gt;<i> community&quot;. The only state which appears to fit in this situation is 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;resolved&quot; or &quot;patch feedback&quot;. Somehow &quot;patch feedback&quot; doesn't seem to 
</I>&gt;<i> fit as I haven't actually submitted a patch, but rather I've attempted 
</I>&gt;<i> to implement a solution.
</I>
There are some guidelines for bug submitting at

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Bugs">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Bugs</A>

as well as a guide to what the different states mean (although the diagram misses out the closed state).  I've always 
regarded 'resolved' as the &quot;solution implemented, awaiting feedback from community&quot; state.

Perhaps as a group we need to go back and review that page and see how it could be made clearer if it's lacking.  I 
suspect that changing the states we currently have will bring only marginal benefits, if any at all.  I also agree with 
Dahlia in that that limiting who can report bugs won't be benificial overall (bureaucracy around who has access, higher 
cost in reporting bugs, etc.)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regardless of the outcome of this discussion, I am hopeful that affected 
</I>&gt;<i> parties can remain mindful that we should try to remain tolerant and 
</I>&gt;<i> respectful of each other and not let individual events steer the project 
</I>&gt;<i> towards a position of less tolerance.
</I>
Some time ago we had more active management of bug reports (most of which was done by non-developers).  I think this is 
  very helpful when that management is done in a respectful, tolerant if occasionally firm way.

</I>&gt;<i>     Yes, the states are confusing. That was the point of the whole
</I>&gt;<i>     thread, I think :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Taking more states out will not necessarily cause mantis to reflect
</I>&gt;<i>     the state of an issue more accurately, and will potentially add to
</I>&gt;<i>     the confusion if insufficient states are shown that dont correlate
</I>&gt;<i>     with the facts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I would remind you all that this is precisely what happened with idb
</I>&gt;<i>     and myself: mantis, for whatever reason, showed me a state for my
</I>&gt;<i>     issue that did not reflect the facts. Worse, it reflected actions by
</I>&gt;<i>     idb he did not actually take, and spawned a big misunderstanding.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I urge you to take the appropriate action to cause tickets to
</I>&gt;<i>     reflect the actual state of the issues that are reported; otherwise,
</I>&gt;<i>     you just continue to sew seeds of misunderstanding and confusion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     If the problem with tickets and their states is that there are too
</I>&gt;<i>     many tickets, or too many tickets of poor quality, or too many
</I>&gt;<i>     tickets abandoned by their reporters, then the solution is not to
</I>&gt;<i>     limit the number of available states for an issue; rather, the
</I>&gt;<i>     solution is to limit access to the ticketing system to approved bug
</I>&gt;<i>     reporters.

</I>&gt;<i>          &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>          &gt; I was originally thinking that we might have more states in
</I>&gt;<i>         mantis
</I>&gt;<i>          &gt; than we really use, so I agree with Mike that we probably
</I>&gt;<i>         don't need
</I>&gt;<i>          &gt; to make it more complicated.
</I>&gt;<i>          &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>          &gt; If people do find separate 'resolved' and 'closed' states to be
</I>&gt;<i>          &gt; useful, though, I'm happy with leaving them as is. They do
</I>&gt;<i>         seem to
</I>&gt;<i>          &gt; end up closed eventually one way or another, so it's not a
</I>&gt;<i>         big deal.
