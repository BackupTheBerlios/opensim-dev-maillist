<PRE>evolution
of virtual worlds.&nbsp; It is no surprise that most Opensim developers =
wish to
go beyond that first step, learning from past mistakes and finding =
better
models for the future.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I mentioned earlier our work at the IETF on new VW protocols, in which =
LL are a
leading party --- see&nbsp; &lt;a =
href=3D&quot;<A HREF="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ogpx">https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ogpx</A>&quot;
target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;<A HREF="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ogpx&lt;/a">https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ogpx&lt;/a</A>&gt; , the =
mailing
list of the VWRAP working group.&nbsp; What may surprise you is that =
even
Lindens know that the current SL is not a good model for the future, =
which is
why the protocols being discussed go far beyond their legacy ones.&nbsp;
Indeed, Lindens will be facing a huge rewrite if this work bears =
fruit.&nbsp;
When even Lindens don't wish their future to be constrained by the =
current SL
design because they know its many problems, this really highlights how =
bad it
would be for the Opensim team to do so. :-)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I hope that one or more of these issues resonates with you, and makes it =
a bit
clearer why Opensim really cannot afford to align itself with SL.&nbsp; =
There
is no future in looking backwards.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p class=3DMsoNormal&gt;Rock,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sympathize with you on many levels.&nbsp; =
I've also
had my doubts regarding the future of OpenSim, but I have also =
maintained some
degree of faith that things will pull through in the end.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For me the shock came when I was abruptly =
informed
that &quot;OpenSim is not Second Life, is not intended to be like Second =
Life,
nor ever will.&quot;&nbsp; I still haven't the foggiest idea what this
developer had smoked for them to so strongly assert that incredibly =
false
statement.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For me, the enjoyment of OpenSim has come from =
my
intense devotion to building and skinning.&nbsp; In fact, for the last =
few
months I've been working on a full region that has many hundreds of =
skins,
clothes, hair, furniture, etc, etc, that I'd like to package up as an =
OAR and
give out freely, since repeatedly I've been told that instead of giving =
money
to help further OpenSim I'd do more proactively by giving content.&nbsp; =
So I
plan to do just that and give my money to other open source initiatives =
that
matter to me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a passion for writing, and have thought =
many
times that one of the greatest powers OpenSim would gain is having =
simple,
straightforward, step-by-step instructions on how to download, compile,
install, administer and overall just plain operate the core =
applications.&nbsp;
What kills me is that everyone who does a search for OpenSim inevitably =
hits
the &lt;a href=3D&quot;<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org">http://opensimulator.org</A>&quot; =
target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;opensimulator.org&lt;/a&gt;
site and that is where the massive roadblock presents itself.&nbsp; It's
useless for most and irrelevant to the few who consider themselves =
OpenSim
experts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heck, even now on the configuration page it =
still
displays info for 0.6.6 including (months old) known bugs in setting up =
region
xml files.&nbsp; If there was appointed a volunteer whose sole job was =
to keep
information on &lt;a href=3D&quot;<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org">http://opensimulator.org</A>&quot; =
target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;opensimulator.org&lt;/a&gt;
relevant that one task would resolve a mountain of negativity right
there.&nbsp; I sit here in front of my computers a good 10 to 12 hours a =
day.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would sincerely love to contribute to the =
OpenSim
project, especially in documentation support.&nbsp; But the thing =
holding me
back is communication.&nbsp; If I cannot get a straight answer on who to =
GIVE
money to in order to help, then I stand little chance of getting clear,
straight answers from developers when asking about issues I need to =
consider
and incorporate in documentation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If communication is a hurdle we can all =
overcome, with
a genuine and heart-felt effort to relay information, motives, and plans =
with
one another, then I'd sincerely appreciate having the opportunity to =
personally
contribute.&nbsp; I'm not a programmer today, but have a degree in =
programming
fro the 90's (so much has changed my degree is practically useless in =
that
regard).&nbsp; But I do know how to explain things and relay information =
in
simple terms.&nbsp; But only if my own questions will be answered with =
more
than &quot;look it up or figure it out yourself&quot; as my answer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any of you would appreciate my help, feel =
free to
let me know at any time and I'll do what I can.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p class=3DMsoNormal&gt;Hi guys,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have decided to leave the Opensim project. You will probably not even =
notice
if I leave, as not being a programmer my only inputs were the writing of =
the
step-by-step tutorials ( &lt;a =
href=3D&quot;<A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/">http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/</A>&quot;
target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;<A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/&lt;/a">http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/&lt;/a</A>&gt; ), the =
drafts of
the OpenSim User Manual on the Forge, and helping out in the IRC =
channels, for
newcomers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You may find my reasons for leaving Opensim interesting though (and =
please do
not construe any of my reasons as an attack on anyone).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
1. The Platform&lt;br&gt;
I raised this several times in the past in IRC, and made posts on my =
blog about
the product lifecycle of the platform ( &lt;a
href=3D&quot;<A HREF="http://rock-vacirca.blogspot.com/2009/02/direction-of-virtual-wor=">http://rock-vacirca.blogspot.com/2009/02/direction-of-virtual-wor=</A>
lds.html&quot;
target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;<A HREF="http://rock-vacirca.blogspot.com/2009/02/direction-of-v=">http://rock-vacirca.blogspot.com/2009/02/direction-of-v=</A>
irtual-worlds.html&lt;/a&gt;
). I believe that the platforms underpinning both Second Life and =
Opensim are
quite long in the tooth now, and I questioned how much product lifecycle =
there
was left, particularly given that Opensim is now nearing 3 years of
development, is still in Alpha, and if the current release of 0.6.7 is =
any
indicator, then still only around two thirds into the development cycle. =
With
the (inevitable) coming of much superior platforms, such as Blue Mars =
and (as a
virtual world); Unity, for browser-based Virtual Wolrds; and now UDK =
(for
creating sandboxes, standalones, and open grids), then I fear that =
Opensim has
missed the boat as far as the remaining lifecycle of the platform is =
concerned.
When you show people what is possible with these engines (for example =
this
avatar editor for the forthcom&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;ing APB (using the Unreal Engine): &lt;a
href=3D&quot;<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DicR3LtEMvZI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DicR3LtEMvZI</A>&quot; =
target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DicR3LtEMvZI&lt;/a">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DicR3LtEMvZI&lt;/a</A>&gt;
or this city: &lt;a href=3D&quot;<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DhmLzNbPXMDg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DhmLzNbPXMDg</A>&quot;
target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DhmLzNbPXMDg&lt;/a">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DhmLzNbPXMDg&lt;/a</A>&gt; =
(using the
CryEngine), then neither SL not Opensim stands comparison.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
2. Lack of Support for Currency in Opensim&lt;br&gt;
I felt the impact of this when I first made the switch from SL to =
Opensim. I
had a thriving RP sim in SL (over 50 people, mainly female) and they all =
agreed
to follow me over to my Opensim and the OSGrid. However, within a month =
they
had all left, citing the same reason, the lack of places to shop, to buy =
the quality
stuff they wanted (skins, hair, clothes etc), as a quality appearance, =
and the
fun of shopping is what all the females placed high on their =
requirements from
a Virtual World. They drifted back to Second Life, and the guys followed =
them.
I have always believed that the lack of support for currency in the core =
was a
mistake, but that is just my opinion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
3. Marketing&lt;br&gt;
I have also raised this issue several times, and blogged about it. It is =
far
from clear just who an eventually released Opensim is actually aimed at. =
I
think that any company that is interested in a firewalled corporate =
solution to
collaboration and prototyping will already be looking at the Enterprise
solution that is currently available from Second Life; that any indie =
group
that is thinking of running a themed grid will need an economy to stay =
viable;
and any individual who is looking for a private sandbox solution for =
their SL
work will need full compatibility (which is not the case with the OS =
version of
LSL diverging from the SL LSL). So, just who is the platform aimed at? I =
was
also very disappointed in the view of one of the core devs who said that
'marketing is a null concept for us'.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am currently designing and creating cities for Blue Mars, and involved =
in a
team for proving the UDK as a platform for the design and creation of =
Virtual
Worlds (as opposed to purely games), and with so much documentation =
available
for these mature engines (particularly for the UDK, Blue Mars lags =
behind
somewhat in that department, but have hired extra staff to put that =
right), I
am achieving the productivity I want, building the worlds that I want, =
with
stable crash-free platforms.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, I do wish the Opensim team the very best in their endeavours, =
and I
sincerely hope their goals are eventually achieved.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If anyone would like to take over the Opensim Tutorials pages at &lt;a
href=3D&quot;<A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/">http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/</A>&quot; =
target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;<A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/&lt;/a">http://chapter-and-metaverse.blogspot.com/&lt;/a</A>&gt;
and &lt;a href=3D&quot;<A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse2.blogspot.com/">http://chapter-and-metaverse2.blogspot.com/</A>&quot; =
target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;<A HREF="http://chapter-and-metaverse2.blogspot.com/&lt;/a">http://chapter-and-metaverse2.blogspot.com/&lt;/a</A>&gt;
(they will need some updating following several changes) then I am more =
than
willing to pass the posts over, and of course the Opensim User Manual is =
there
in the Forge for anyone to develop further.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Best Regards and Good Luck&lt;br&gt;
