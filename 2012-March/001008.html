<PRE>problem. It's actually counter-productive, as people, being irrational
agents in general, will simply hear the message &quot;you're nuts&quot;, and will
come back again with more arguments for why they are not being
irrational. It's a dead-end conversation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Option b) is one that most technologists don't believe, because they
know quite well that such policing cannot be done with the technology,
but with an aggressive costumer protection department. Some
technologists may very well follow it, because they know that there is
some short-term cash to be made -- until it eventually dissolves when
they realize that the costs of keeping the police and prosecution
departments far outweigh the revenue, at least in a situation where
there is no monopoly and people have choices (history shows that people
tend to be attracted by tolerance).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My favorite is option c), and I think that OpenSim is general enough to
account for several service models to emerge. People who want extra
protection should only produce content on grids that offer that kind of
protection, and not on the other, more tolerant, ones. I personally
believe that such policing-heavy grids will not have a chance of
surviving, unless, besides the protection, they offer some really cool
things that attract people to them in the first place; but hey! - the
point is that people will have choices.&lt;br&gt;

Noted.&nbsp; ;)&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

 style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;Your
arguments are spot on. :) I would add that having DRM or attempting&lt;br&gt;
to curtail end users fredom of use is pushing society to being&lt;br&gt;
untrustable. There is an old saying. Say something often enough and it&lt;br&gt;
becomes true. Say people WILL steal content at times, be paranoid about&lt;br&gt;
it and far more people WILL steal your content due to lack of respect ,&lt;br&gt;
which is earned by the creator's lack of trust in others.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is no paranoia in the valid concern that people will attempt to
rip you off.&nbsp; It happens all the time.&nbsp; It will never cease to amaze me
how entitled people feel to other people's Intellectual Property.&nbsp; THAT
is where the lack of respect and trust comes into play.&nbsp; An artist or
author who wishes to protect their work from those who are low enough
to steal from them should not be looked on as paranoid, they are simply
trying to enforce their rights under law.&nbsp; Theft is where the lack of
respect and trust come from.&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;
 style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;However
if you as a creator can bring yourself to see the good in&lt;br&gt;
others, most will respect you enough to not steal your work. You will&lt;br&gt;
still have some minor theft happening, but not nearly enough to stop you&lt;br&gt;
from creating and profiting from your creations. This is just life and&lt;br&gt;
society in general and unavoidable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By your argument, we should do away with police and trust people to
behave themselves.&nbsp; Simply because it is impossible to prevent all
theft, does not mean we should just give up in our attempts to make it
difficult.&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;
 style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;Here's
another parallel to the whole DRM debate. We trust each other to&lt;br&gt;
not run around killing people. We don't walk around wearing 100%&lt;br&gt;
protective body armour because, well, it's impossibly expensive, and no&lt;br&gt;
one will trust you due to your obvious paranoia. ;) Instead, we walk&lt;br&gt;
around with no armour at all, yet the threat of serious bodily harm is&lt;br&gt;
still there, and we manage to survive just fine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tell that to the two teenagers who were shot to death across town here
last week.&nbsp; They were in their driveway playing basketball.&nbsp; Or the
elderly man who was gunned down in his driveway a few towns away the
week before that.&nbsp; The danger is there, and it would certainly be far
worse if there were no police to keep it relatively in check.&nbsp; While
there is no such thing as 100% safe, we are more safe due to the
protections in place.&nbsp; This analogy works just as well for asset
protection in a metaverse environment.&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;
 style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;There
are bad apples, just don't let one bad apple ruin your&lt;br&gt;
relationship with the rest of the apples.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are bad apples, that we agree on.&nbsp; The question is what to do
about it.&nbsp; Do we attempt to curb the bulk of content theft, or do we
simply force content creators to deal with a lack of protection for
their work?&nbsp; If you were to poll the vast majority of content creators
in Second Life what they would prefer...&nbsp; no protection for their work,
or some protection... what do you think their response would be?&nbsp; And
let's face it...&nbsp; as it stands... the majority of people who will be
designing content for a metaverse based on OpenSim will come from
Second Life.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
I can understand that from a developers perspective, Intellectual
Property Rights protection is a nasty bear to wrestle in the
development of the metaverse, but I do not see how the metaverse
project benefits from alienating the people who will make the metaverse
interesting.&nbsp; Think about it...&nbsp; what would you have without content?&nbsp;
Lots of empty space.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
I believe that the first metaverse platform to successfully solve the
IP Rights issue will end up on the top of the pile.&nbsp; And with the
concept that Charles and I were discussing here last night, I think
OpenSim could well be that platform.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
