<PRE>d=2C=20
  * for the people wanting to do public beta grade services based on OpenSi=
m
  * for developers that want to code on modules without sudden mysterious b=
reaks
  * and for the devs that want to debug without new parameters being introd=
uced.
=20
Now of course=2C vendor branches is one other way to do this=2C but what we=
 at Tribal realized=2C was that since we're coding in modules=2C all we use=
d the vendor branch for was for stabilizing fixes.
=20
And since that work would otherwise be duplicated in a number of dev teams=
=2C it makes sense to share that work.
=20
&gt;<i> A better approach to stability than stable branches is&gt; to help create un=
</I>it tests for trunk.=20
=20
Which of course not only is a totally untestable assertion=2C but also has =
to be weighted against a pragmatical timescale.
=20
&gt;<i> This helps contain behavior=2C and&gt; drives towards code correctness for p=
</I>arts of the tree.=20
=20
+1 to extended testing.
=20
&gt;<i> I'd encourage people&gt; spend time on enhancing automated testing instead o=
</I>f doing point in time&gt; stable branches.
I'd encourage people to do both=2C as I believe compairing the efforts woul=
d be like compairing apples to pears. One is about testing the correctness =
of the code in a point of time=2C the other is to provide an aggregate of e=
xperience to facilitate a work process.
=20
At heart=2C I'm an agile coder. I do believe that trunk should always be in=
 a shippable state=2C but to think that that means you should always ship t=
runk=2C is to over-simplify.

&amp;gt=3B &amp;gt=3B I can see some people being hesitant to commit to supporting =
this&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B &amp;gt=3B because they don't want to worry about committing to =
two branches each&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B &amp;gt=3B time they have a fix=2C or they don't wa=
nt to maintain two slightly&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B &amp;gt=3B different code bases.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp=3B&lt;BR&gt;
This would be 100% optional=2C and probably done by a small group of devote=
es (like me and Darren=2C as in the case of the last stable) whose only hum=
bly wish is to get a heads-up from peple whenever&amp;nbsp=3Ba good=2C clean bu=
g fix has been committed.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp=3B&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;gt=3B &amp;gt=3B&amp;nbsp=3BBug reports could also become more of a hassle as&lt;BR&gt;&amp;=
gt=3B &amp;gt=3B some users will report bugs against the trunk=2C while others =
against the&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B &amp;gt=3B stable branch.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
My concept will not work if we don't re-branch new stables reasonably often=
 - the heart of the concept is that 'stable' should not deviate from trunk =
very far at all=2C just minor bug fixes and changes deemed 'harmless'.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp=3B&lt;BR&gt;
The reason=2C of course=2C is exactly that we should be reasonably certain =
a bug exists in both branches.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp=3B&lt;BR&gt;
Apart from that=2C we have that same problem on every revision. The user ne=
eds to tell us what revision (or trunk) the error is on.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B &amp;gt=3B Having said that=2C I can see a benefit for having a stab=
le branch.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B &amp;gt=3B Ideally it would follow trunk pretty closely=2C=
 and when it becomes&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B &amp;gt=3B challenging to apply patches to both =
trees without too much massaging=2C&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B &amp;gt=3B it's time to do final =
stabilization on that final branch and release.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
That was the general idea. Bu tI would say=2C given the agile nature of the=
 project=2C that we just _define_ that=2C &quot;when bug fixes does not apply cl=
eanly=2C it's an indication we should bump the number&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B &amp;gt=3B I would like to encourage you to give this a try.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp=3B&lt;BR&gt;
We already are. At the moment=2C I'm just waiting for people to tell me we =
have a reasonably stable revision that I can branch again.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp=3B&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;gt=3B&amp;nbsp=3B&amp;gt=3B In the meantime=2C don't expect too much&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B &amp;gt=
=3B commitment from all the devs=2C and be prepared to take responsibility&lt;=
BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B &amp;gt=3B for this stable branch. After some time=2C we can all look=
 back at how&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B &amp;gt=3B things went and decide what to do in the futu=
re.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
This is basically what happened with 0.6.0-stable. Only thing we need is he=
lp with finding the revisions=2C and to get tipped about good stabilizing&amp;n=
bsp=3Bfixes in trunk.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B The problem with stable branches... is they aren't. If you add c=
ode to&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B a branch=2C you have the potential to break it=2C especial=
ly on a source&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B base as complex as OpenSim.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
True as that may be=2C&amp;nbsp=3Bof course it depends on what type of code you=
 add=2C and how much.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp=3B&lt;BR&gt;
If we were talking doing serious work on a 'real' branch=2C I would be much=
 more inclined to agree=2C but the point of this is to keep it ligth=2C agi=
le and to a minimum of deviation.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B Personally=2C I'm going to stay focused on trunk=2C that's where=
 my time and&lt;BR&gt;&amp;gt=3B interest lies.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp=3B&lt;BR&gt;
Then do. I'm not trying to rally resources devoted into this=2C I'm merely =
trying to work out a process that would work given the nature of the OpenSi=
m project.&lt;BR&gt;
