<PRE>I think a number of people were thinking I meant something a lot more complex than I do (at least to start with)

So as soon as I get time I'm going to try to write a more clear in depth email. Just that won't be for a few days or more. 

But yeah basically as you said end to end funnels with servlets attaching to the ends.

I was thinking, if anything, of more like a cut down web services protocol stack.
   
 My prototype channel is just a basic HTTP based one. That just finds where the url of the channel receiver, that the required servlet is currently registered at, is. Then does a HTTP POST of the serialised message to that url. 
   
 But the implementation should be up to the channels. All the rest of the system should care is that a channel can pass messages from one end point to another, and can map some standard addressing scheme to those endpoints. Allowing for a dynamic system, where the addressable message receivers (the servlets) can move around the endpoints on a channel as needed. And new endpoints can be added.
  ah. ok. so it's not a network bus, but rather a dual-ended funnel --- like &gt;--&lt; ? with servlets attaching themselves to the respective funnels on each end?
 
     cheers,

 &gt; I'm been thinking and prototyping about some improvements on the grid 
 &gt; servers/protocols.
 &gt;
 &gt; One of my aims is to try to separate the network code more from the 
 &gt; logic code. So am thinking of what I'm calling a Channel and servlet 
 &gt; system.
 &gt;
 &gt; A servlet is just a class that performs some service. I'm thinking     
 &gt; more in terms of breaking up the current servers into smaller 
 &gt; services/servlets.
 &gt;
 &gt; So then we have a collection of servlets that do the various functions 
 &gt; that the current servers do (except I'm not including the asset server 
 &gt; in this as think that is best kept to a proper REST resource based     
 &gt; system).
 &gt;
 &gt; Then we come to the channel, maybe this is a bad term for what I'm     
 &gt; thinking, but anyway. The channel has two (or three) parts, the 
 &gt; sender/receivers, which are responsible for the 
 &gt; serialising/deserialising of the messages/datagrams, and also of 
 &gt; sending it to the correct url. To find the url that a message should 
 &gt; be sent to, the other part of the channel is responsible. I'm 
 &gt; currently thinking of this as a basic central hash table service, that 
 &gt; just keeps track of the servlets that are registered on that channel 
 &gt; and the url of the endpoint that they are one. Of course the idea with 
 &gt; the channel is to keep the code separate from the service logic, so 
 &gt; how the servlet tracking is done is up to the implementation.
 &gt;
 &gt; While each servlet could actually have its own endpoint/channel 
 &gt; receiver, I'm thinking more of a collection of them sharing a 
 &gt; endpoint. So normally maybe only one endpoint per server instance.
 &gt;
 &gt; So all a channel really is: Is a managed collection of known services 
 &gt; and the url they can be reached at. Plus the code for de/serialising 
 &gt; the messages in the format that channel uses.
 &gt;
 &gt; The third component is the Router service. Each server instance would 
 &gt; have one of these, that is tasked with routing the messages to and     
 &gt; from the channel endpoint to the correct servlet. A router could be 
 &gt; connected to more than one channel.
 &gt;
 &gt; Again a basic concept. The task is just to keep track of servlets in 
 &gt; that instance, to know what channels they should be receiving messages 
 &gt; from. To be able to route a message from a servlet to a channel; 
 &gt; either a particular channel, or the servlet might just say any channel 
 &gt; that has a particular type of service registered on it. Also the 
 &gt; router should be able to do internal routing...from one servlet to     
 &gt; another that is in the same instance.
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; I'm also thinking that the region servers will have such a router and 
 &gt; be registered on a channel(s). And then region modules could send and 
 &gt; receive messages the same way.
 &gt;
 &gt; My thoughts and actually my requirements for some other ideas. Is to 
 &gt; have a dynamic modular system. That keeps the network code completely 
 &gt; separate from the services logic. I really think that the current 
 &gt; servers are too err monolithic and really group together a bunch of 
 &gt; services that are separate. I don't mean they should always be on 
 &gt; separate servers, just the code should be separated more and more 
 &gt; modular.
 &gt;
 &gt; So my thoughts are lots of smaller services/servlets. And once we do 
 &gt; that, it could lead to lots of url having to be kept track of by each 
 &gt; other servlet if we used the current approach. So thats why I think 
 &gt; the network code , including url management/tracking should be 
 &gt; completely separate.
 &gt; This also I think/hope could help with scaling things. In that as the 
 &gt; servlets can be grouped together as needed (and even moved around the 
 &gt; server instances). Then a very small grid might only want to run one 
 &gt; backend server instance that had all the servlets that it needs 
 &gt; running. While a much larger grid might have a server instance for     
 &gt; each servlet, and maybe more than one servlet of each type running.
 &gt;
 &gt; Also its possible that we could use the same servlets in standalone 
 &gt; mode, as they would just use the internal routing function of the 
 &gt; routing service.
 &gt;
 &gt; Another benefit is it helps to make the whole thing more customizable. 
 &gt; In a number of different ways. One of those ways is something that     
 &gt; I've done some prototyping of. Which is as the servlets and router     
 &gt; classes have no network code in at all. Its a simple task to write     
 &gt; different versions of the channel receivers/senders for say a ASP.net 
 &gt; implementation.
 &gt;
 &gt; There are still a number of things that need more thought. But thats a 
 &gt; general overview of my ideas
