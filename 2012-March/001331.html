<PRE>=20
* Overly complex (the configuration seem to, in themselves, be on par with =
actually coding generic mappers)
* Mandating major changes in our object structure (opening up for encapsula=
tion violations or forcing dependencies on hibernate)
* Totally invasive (as in, in practice demanding its storage philosophy to =
be acommodated for and coded into core objects)
=20
It has been proven a very bad thing to let objects take care of their own d=
b serialization. More often than not, the object cannot be serialized from =
within its own context (it might not have data like 'parent' needed for rel=
ational storage) - and the object itself should not know about any given se=
rialization method.
=20
It IS a very bad thing to rely on 'storage' as a prime db serialization con=
cept - you want 'changes': the first thing we need to do when we get to opt=
imize the db layer, is to introduce more fine-grained update calls, like 'C=
hangeOwner' and 'StoreTextures' instead of 'store object, with prims, textu=
res and shapes'. I have asked several times how this would be accomodated i=
n nhibernate, but have got no answers.
=20
Now, I've been asking for some kind of overview of the wins with this and w=
hat the drawbacks are, but have so far got none that gives me any idea of w=
hat impact this has on our modular approach or on performance.
=20
If we're not going to let it 'hibernate' objects, as in 'let the objects th=
emselves store themselves' and if we have to set up config files detailing =
out the mappings, why simply not just CODE the thing and get the granularit=
y, performance and customizability (as in, being able to let the objects be=
 serialized according to their different internal structures) that comes wi=
th it?
=20
Best,
/Stefan

ello everyone:I hadn't any time to &quot;nhibernating&quot; opensim (as I told months=
 ago) but the code I did is there.Sean I know my code may be &quot;complicated&quot; =
when starting, that's for the use of factories and DAO's. My intention was =
to convert every nhibernate object in a DAO, so they will know how to save,=
 update, delete... themselves (a simple call to AssetDAO.Save(id) for examp=
le). Well, for testing your approach is better if you don't have enough exp=
erience with hibernate.Second, my approach was to not modify the current ob=
jects, mapping them to nhibernate classes. Of course the better idea is to =
use the libsl-hibernatized objects (with getters and setters) throughout th=
e code w/o intermediate mapping classes. I think the advantages of having &quot;=
intelligent&quot; getters and setters where we could put validations, or even cl=
asses than can serialize (to XML or whatever) are more than the &quot;overload a=
nd memory use&quot; disadvantages.Third (fuck, I'm making a list) the ID questio=
n: do not use the &quot;auto&quot; ids (generated by nhibernate). Let opensim create =
them. The overhead of letting hibernate create these ids is higher than the=
 CoCreateId call opensim does. If you want to use a byte array for storing =
ids (due to better performance), use it; hibernate hasn't any problem with =
it (the &quot;recommended id&quot; is an integer because hibernate is often used in &quot;=
enterprise environments&quot;, there isn't any other reason).Four, I tested my p=
revious code (apart from .NET) with mono + SQLite + nhibernate w/o &quot;touchin=
g&quot; anything (I used the included sqlite drivers included with opensim). I c=
an't help you here.Five, instead of using the hbm.xml files you can use map=
ping attributes (that was the point where I stopped). The same with the hib=
ernate.cfg.xml, you can set its properties &quot;programatically&quot;. The advantage=
s: if you change one data object you don't have to change the xml file too;=
 and less files in the bin directory as well.Six, you can generate the db s=
chemma automatically (I think I provided an example), it's db independent. =
If you are using mapping attributes instead of hbm.xml just serialize the o=
bjects (there are some examples looking for &quot;nhibernate mapping attributes&quot;=
 in google). It works...Seven, sorry. I wanted to help you developing a hib=
ernate base but I had only 1 &quot;relatively&quot; free week to did it. Maybe in the=
 future.Greetings and good luckImpalah &quot;busy guy&quot; Shenzhou

Yeah, well; I'm not saying it IS, just that we need to check on it.I glimps=
ed that as I was trying to find out what the 'best practice' for storing gu=
ids in MySQL databases was; I actually didn't find any good info on that. /=
