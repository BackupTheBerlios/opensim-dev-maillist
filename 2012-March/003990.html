Things are very messy right now. You can search for &quot;sim_ip&quot;=2C for example=
=2C
which is used in chatting with the grid server=2C and where it is being
converted to an IP address in about half of the cases.

To compensate=2C and before I noticed this inconsistency=2C Homer introduce=
d
another field called &quot;sim_host&quot;=2C so not to mess with what was already the=
re=2C
that is supposed to carry the external host name=2C but this only works up =
to
the point in which RegionInfo data structures are created. At that point=2C=
 we
need to decide what to place in m_externalHostName=2C sim_ip or sim_host.
Which means changes in OGS1.

I also noticed that there is yet another data structure called RegionUpData
that uses IP addresses.

So=2C messy. Someone should decide what this field is supposed to be=2C and=
 make
it a rule.

Subject: [Opensim-dev] external host name

It turns out that a lot of problems with CAPs have to do with
inconsistencies surrounding the URL of the seed cap. Specifically=2C in
some cases we're producing URLs with hostnames=2C other times we're
producing URLs with IP addresses=2C for example:

<A HREF="http://ucigrid03.nacs.uci.edu:9000/CAPS/4cfc94fa-09be-409b-b136-cda2cdde000=">http://ucigrid03.nacs.uci.edu:9000/CAPS/4cfc94fa-09be-409b-b136-cda2cdde000=</A>

MailScanner has detected a possible fraud attempt from &quot;128.200.71.43:9000&quot;
claiming to be MailScanner warning: numerical links are often malicious:
MailScanner warning: numerical links are often malicious: <A HREF="http://128.200.71=">http://128.200.71=</A>
.43:9000/CAPS/4cfc94fa-09be-409b-b136-cda2cdde0000/

The client is not smart enough to test if this is the same host=2C it
assumes it isn't=2C so it decides someone's trying to game it.

The inconsistencies are all over the code in OpenSim=2C and they pertain
to the use of ExternalHostName in several data s! tructures. In some
cases=2C an explicit conversion to IP addresses is made.

We should converge to one single thing. And I believe that thing should
be whatever it is given in external_host_name config. Is this right?
However=2C I am a bit afraid this is going to break 17 different things...
