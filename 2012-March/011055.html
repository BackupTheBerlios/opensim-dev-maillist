<PRE>(Apologies if you have read this already on Opensim-users but it didn't 
get any repsonses there so I thought I would try here as well.)

I have an accelerometer connected to an Arduino that has been reflashed 
to imitate a standard USB HID joystick which I can use with a Second 
Life/OpenSim viewer using the standard joystick support - it's kinda fun 
actually!

I want to use it to control the angle/gaze of the camera according to 
the angle of the accelerometer - eg if I tilt upwards the camera tilts 
upwards the same amount, but when I stop tilting the camera stops moving 
- the project involves running the client on a tablet which the user can 
point around like a digital camera to 'look' in a particular direction. 
This behaviour is captured by the '3D cursor' option but that only seems 
to work when in flycam mode. I can live with that, but I'm running into 
a problem.

Whenever the accelerometer is flat, it sends '0' from the Y axis 
(arbitrary number for explanation) which should always equate to the 
camera looking straight forward, parallel to the ground. So if I tilt 
the accelerometer up, then tilt it back to flat, the camera should look 
up by that amount &amp; then come back to straight forward/parallel to the 
ground.

However if I tilt up &amp; back to flat, or down &amp; back to flat, a few 
times, the camera begins to drift from the straight forward/parallel 
position. The further &amp; more that I tilt up/down, the worse this gets, 
until with the accelerometer level &amp; sending '0' along the Y axis, the 
camera is pointing straight down at the floor, or even behind the 
avatar! The only solution I have come across so far is to do Reset View 
&amp; then re-enable Joystick Flycam, which is far from convenient.

Does anybody know what may be causing this? I have set the relevant 
deadzones to 0, tried changing feathering &amp; smoothing, changing the 
relevant scale, etc. but all to no avail. It's as if the flycam actually 
changes what it considers to be 'level' or '0' as it 'moves'?

CJ Davies
