Subject: [Opensim-dev] LSL test suite ideas


I have been putting together a few ideas on how to include more tests 
for LSL. I am thinking of putting together a set of scripts that would 
systematically test all the script functionality that is currently 
implemented. I would start slow with a few functions and grow over time, 
hopefully with others contributions as well. I was thinking I would 
divide the functionality up into logical groups so that it wouldn't be 
too huge and would allow a developer to beat on a specific area if desired.

I know we have used the Kan-Ed scripts in the past but as far as I can 
tell, the Kan-Ed scripts are no more - the Kansas Board of Regents 
closed down the URL for some reason. We could probably piece together 
most of it, but that is not really what I had in mind. The Kan-Ed 
scripts were good for showing a large set worked in world, but I am 
thinking more systematic coverage and reporting. The Kan-Ed scripts 
still required interpretation by someone in world as to whether they 
were working properly or not.

I have had some irc discussions and I think the best approach for now is 
to have a set of scripts that are checked in and exist in inventory that 
can be run in world and would report the success or failure of the 
functions tested. Maybe this report could be pushed out to a webpage for 
on-line status of the current state of the LSL. This would be a 
supplemental  help to me as I  have been manually testing and updating 
the function list and status for several months now.  Additionally, it 
would be nice for putting a load on the script engine for scalability 
and performance testing. There are a few helper os functions that may 
need to be implemented, but the core of what would be tested would be 
done via LSL.

Comments?

I see that we have some scripts in our library. If we had scripts similar to the notion that kan-ed originally used, that is about 10 scripts covering the range from very simple to complex, then we have a series of scripts we can use for testing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From time to time, we can then encourage others to add to the test script library as we have additional functionality. The important thing is, I believe, that having such a standard set of scripts again allows is to guide our users to a common level of functionality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charles&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;----- Original Message ----&lt;br&gt;From: krtaylor
