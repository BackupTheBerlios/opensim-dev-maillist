<PRE>Sorry, but this is ambiguous.

At the question &quot;Why should some script to be manually reset(&#8230;)&quot;, the answer was given: &quot;they don't, you can reset them automatically with correct change state&quot;.

If the question is actually &quot;why should they be reset?&quot;. My personal answer is: It sounds logical to me that a script relying on the region needs adjustments when the region conditions change.

But actually, in most cases, a reset is not really needed, it's just the lazy way to ensure everything is done after changes. I have some scripts which I don't reset and where I just force some checks, using sates or a function, when conditions changes (owner, region, attached, &#8230;).

About the question &quot;Is this to be considered a bug?&quot;, if your script does not reset when you use the correct change state, it would be a bug.

&gt;<i> Thanks for your answers, they are all quite clarifying especially Justin's remark on stopping/starting which seems an easy and practical workaround. (I'm also impressed by the fact that many of you did answer so rapidly, this means that opensim scripting community is NOT small, should be some way to exchange tricks and tips somewhere).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My original question however is NOT how to force the restart of the script after a restart (actually I checked my script and it used 256, so probably I have to change it to 1024, and that probably would solve the problem).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The core of the question IS: Why should some script to be manually reset to retain their original behaviour? Is this to be considered a bug and so I should file a Mantis, or your experience is different? (Maybe I have to set up some particular things in opensim.ini or I erroneously set a different setup. For instance I set up to NOT delete scripts at startup in my sims, and this might be interacting with other behaviour?).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe when region restarts some events are forgotten to be reinstalled from the simulator script engine? I'm very curious to understand how the XEngine is working so to have a look and figure out myself what's happening. Is there any documentation on this piece of code?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your feedbacks and helps,
</I>&gt;<i> salahzar
